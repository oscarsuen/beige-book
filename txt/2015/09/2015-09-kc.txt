Professional, high-tech, and transportation firms reported moderately higher sales compared to a year ago and expected further gains over the coming months.

Banking contacts reported stable loan demand, loan quality and credit standards as well as a slight increase in deposit levels. Energy activity remained weak as oil prices fell to six-year lows. District farm income remained subdued, agricultural credit conditions weakened, and crop prices dropped sharply as a strong fall harvest was expected.
