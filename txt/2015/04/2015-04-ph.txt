Aggregate business activity in the Third District continued to grow at a modest pace during this current Beige Book period. Staffing firms and other general service-sector firms continued to report a moderate pace of growth; however, auto sales appear to have slowed to a modest pace of growth after adjusting for the relatively colder winter weather effects in 2014 compared with 2015. Nonauto retailers continued to report modest growth, as did the commercial real estate sectors for construction and for leasing of existing commercial properties. Manufacturers continued to report only slight growth, and brokers reported the same in regard to existing home sales. Residential builders responded with mixed reports of slower construction progress due to bad weather but also reported rising inquiries and contract signings. Reports from tourism contacts also were mixed, with late snow and cold conditions extending the ski season somewhat but limiting visitor traffic at shore destinations.
Lending volumes appeared to slow--registering only a slight pace of growth. Generally, credit quality continued to improve. As in the previous Beige Book, contacts reported slight increases in wages and home prices. Overall price levels were also up slightly, but some prices fell, as the impact of lower energy prices worked its way through the economy. Contacts continued to anticipate moderate growth of economic activity over the next six months.
Expectations of growth during the next six months remained positive at levels typical for an expansionary period. Some firms continued to note greater uncertainty due to anticipated weak demand from customers serving the energy production sectors; however, few have noted direct reductions yet. Firms reported slight decreases in their expectations of future employment and capital expenditures. These shifts were driven by fewer firms reporting expected hiring and by more firms reporting decreases in future spending.
Auto dealers reported modest growth in sales year over year--lower than last period. As with general retail sales, auto sales growth was higher year over year, until adjusting for the severe winter weather last year and for one fewer sales weekend in March 2015. Pennsylvania dealers reported that March 2014 had benefited from a rebound off of low February sales due to heavy snows. This year's bleak winter weather continued into March, thereby limiting the normal rise in sales from February to March. Similarly, New Jersey dealers anticipated higher sales in March than in February, but they were far below last year's tally. Auto dealers remained optimistic for overall growth in 2015.
Nonresidential real estate contacts reported little change to the modest pace of construction and leasing activity. New construction continued to be dominated by projects in downtown Allentown and Philadelphia that include office, retail, and residential components. Throughout the Third District, industrial/warehouse projects, public infrastructure, and suburban office renovations remain active and in demand. Design and renovations to improve energy-efficiency are also in demand. Contacts attributed a little continued rent pressure on office space to some emerging employment growth. Demand and rent pressures are greatest in downtown and suburban Philadelphia, especially for Class A or better office space. Center City Philadelphia residential and retail markets, as well as several select suburban office markets, also continued to be active. Contacts remained optimistic for the ongoing growth of both new construction and leasing activity in 2015.
Third District tourist areas reported mixed conditions as the winter drew to a close. The added snow and cold extended the ski season a little, but conditions were too harsh to attract extra visitors along the shore. However, contacts up and down the shore have reported very strong early bookings for the summer season, with many weekends booked up. After a one-month anomalous increase in January, revenue results for Atlantic City casinos resumed the old patter of double-digit declines in February.
