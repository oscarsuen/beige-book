On balance, the economy in the Fourth District expanded at a slight pace during the past six weeks. Activity at manufacturing plants was mixed. In residential real estate markets, unit volumes and single-family home prices rose; nonresidential construction fell below levels seen during the prior few months. Retailers and auto dealers reported marginally higher sales than a year ago. Spending for new drilling in the Marcellus and Utica Shales has been significantly curtailed. Freight volumes were lower due primarily to the effects of lingering cold weather and West Coast labor disputes. The demand for business credit continued to slowly move higher, while demand for consumer credit softened.
Payrolls were little changed on net, although construction contractors expect brisk hiring in the second quarter. Bankers are expanding payrolls in the areas of risk management and commercial lending. Staffing firms reported a pick-up in the number of job openings and placements in the health care, IT, and manufacturing industries. Upward pressure on wages is limited to experienced and technically skilled personnel in construction and freight hauling. Overall, input and finished goods prices were steady. We heard reports about declines in prices for agricultural commodities, oil, and steel, and rising prices for some building materials.
Capital spending remained on plan for the most part. Deviations were in response to changes in customer demand--higher or lower. Monies were allocated primarily for maintenance and new equipment. Aerospace suppliers are increasing their R&D budgets. Raw material prices declined, particularly for agricultural commodities, oil, petroleum-based products, and steel. Producers were reluctant to pass through lower input prices to customers. On balance, manufacturing payrolls were steady.
Several general contractors reported a slowing in nonresidential construction due to lingering cold weather. Nonetheless, inquiries have been coming in at a steady pace, and backlogs were characterized as normal. Demand is greatest in commercial building, healthcare, higher education, and public infrastructure. Credit is more readily available to successful developers than it has been over the past few years. Capital spending by general contractors was mainly for technology, new equipment, and maintenance. Our contacts, while optimistic about short-term growth prospects, are concerned about potential labor shortages.
Materials prices were stable apart from increases for concrete, drywall, and finished wood products. Diesel fuel and structural steel prices were lower. Payroll growth remained flat due to the harsh winter weather. As the spring season progresses, general contractors expect a period of fairly robust hiring, including craft workers, project engineers, and managers. Wage pressure is building across the industry. Subcontractors are busy, and they are pushing through rate increases to cover rising costs, including for labor, and to widen margins.
Year-to-date new motor vehicle sales through February were slightly higher than those of a year ago. Sales began to pick up in March with the warmer weather. One contact reported that consumer preferences have been shifting from cars to SUVs and trucks, which is boosting transaction prices for dealers and margins for manufacturers. Looking at 2015, dealers expect sales will remain strong, but they believe that total domestic sales will flatten out at 2014 levels. New inventory is slightly elevated due to February's lower unit volume. Used vehicle transactions showed a modest increase over last year. Dealers are starting to hire seasonal sales personnel, while service departments are feeling wage pressures due to a lack of qualified mechanics.
