Outside of manufacturing, the Fifth District economy grew at a moderately faster pace in the weeks since the previous Beige Book. In manufacturing, shipments and new orders fell as winter weather forced shutdowns. Retail sales rose at a slower pace. However, revenue growth increased moderately at non-retail services firms, along with stronger tourism activity. Loan demand grew modestly. Residential and commercial real estate markets also continued to strengthen. Agricultural contacts reported seasonal increases in activity. Labor markets generally improved.
According to the most recent surveys, manufacturing and service sector employment rose at a slightly faster pace since the previous Beige Book report. Average wages in the manufacturing sector continued to rise at a tepid pace, and in the service sector, wage growth moderated somewhat. Manufacturing prices paid and prices received rose slightly faster. Retail prices increased more quickly and price increases in the non-retail service sector remained mild. Energy prices softened.
Contacts in the tourism industry reported stronger group bookings in recent weeks. A large increase in group bookings more than offset a decline in the leisure category, according to a Virginia hotel manager, and capital spending rose at the resort. An executive at a North Carolina hotel reported that convention and group business increased year-over-year and he expected strong summer bookings despite new competition in his region. A South Carolina hotelier also reported a significant year-over-year increase in occupancy and a North Carolina hotel manager reported strong revenue growth supported in good measure by military and corporate bookings. In western Virginia, a resort hotel manager said this winter's revenues were above the record-setting revenues of a year ago, in part due to extended cold weather. As a result, the resort has been able to start new capital projects. A tourism executive on the outer banks of North Carolina said weekends have been strong since our previous report, with big events and good weather helping to draw tourists. In addition, construction of large rental properties has recently increased in that location. Room rates and rental rates were mostly unchanged, according to our contacts.
Commercial real estate activity increased moderately since our previous Beige Book. Retail leasing rose in Virginia, primarily driven by demand for restaurant space, value fashion stores, and food stores. A Maryland contact reported that retail space in grocery-anchored locations has commanded higher rents. Demand in the District has picked up for health care space, executive offices, and residential real estate offices. In Maryland, stronger demand was largely driven by government contractors. According to a Realtor in Virginia, vacancy rates for retail space declined while office vacancy rates increased slightly as tenants formerly in large spaces moved to smaller spaces. Another Virginia Realtor said that limited new commercial space had come online, keeping vacancies stable to slightly lower. In North Carolina, vacancy rates decreased for retail, office, and industrial spaces. Throughout the District, there was new construction of multi-family residential buildings, hotels, and medical centers. A South Carolina contact cited concerns of some overheating in 1-4 unit multi-family development. A Virginia Realtor said that new apartment supply continues to be absorbed, with new projects continuing in Norfolk and Richmond.
Coal production increased slightly since our previous report, largely due to the effects of harsh winter weather on coal demand; however, production was lower than in the same period last year. Coal prices were unchanged since our last Beige Book. Production of natural gas decreased slightly in response to prices, which remained historically low, except for a brief spike in prices due to the cold weather.
