Growth in the Second District's economy has continued at a moderate pace since the last report. Businesses report that cost pressures overall have abated further, though there are some reports of increased wage pressures; selling prices remain generally stable to up slightly. In general, businesses report that conditions have improved somewhat since the last report. Labor market conditions appear to have strengthened further in the final weeks of 2014. Retailers report that holiday season sales were somewhat disappointing and little changed from 2013 levels, though sales picked up toward the latter part of December. Auto dealers characterize sales as sluggish in November, though both picked up, to varying degrees, in December. Tourism remained fairly robust in late 2014, and consumer confidence climbed to a multi-year high. Housing markets were mixed but, on balance, somewhat stronger in the final weeks of 2014; multi-family construction has been fairly brisk. Office markets have been generally steady, while the market for industrial space has strengthened a bit. Finally, banks report increased loan demand--particularly from the commercial sector--as well as narrowing loan spreads; delinquency rates continued to decline for commercial loans and mortgages, but picked up for residential mortgages.
Reports from auto dealers across upstate New York indicate that sales were sluggish in November but picked up somewhat in December. Rochester-area dealers note that new vehicle sales weakened substantially in November but rebounded in early December, while used car sales improved. Buffalo-area dealers paint a more mixed picture: new auto sales have not rebounded substantially from November's weather-depressed levels, though sales of used vehicles have picked up somewhat. Auto dealers in both areas note that both wholesale and retail credit conditions remain favorable.
Consumer confidence in the region climbed in December, based on the Conference Board's survey of residents in the region. Confidence rose to a 10-month high in New York State and to a more than one-year high in the broader Middle Atlantic region (NY, NJ, PA). Tourism continued to be strong in late 2014. Broadway theaters report that attendance and revenues accelerated in December, and were up more than 10 percent from comparable 2013 levels. Manhattan hotels also report that business has continued to be brisk toward the end of the year.
New York City's residential rental market has been mixed: Rents in Manhattan and Brooklyn have picked up somewhat and are up roughly 5 percent from a year ago, while Queens rents have been fairly steady. Residential rents elsewhere around the New York City metro area are reported to be up 4-6 percent from a year ago, while rents across upstate New York are up about 2 percent. Rental vacancy rates have risen slightly across the District, though they remain fairly low, especially in New York City. Multi-family construction remained fairly robust throughout most of the District in the fourth quarter.
Commercial real estate markets were mixed but, on balance, somewhat stronger in the fourth quarter. In New York City, office availability rates continue to drift down to new multi-year lows, while asking rents are running 6-8 percent higher than a year ago. Availability rates also edged down in northern New Jersey but edged up in Long Island and across upstate New York. Rents outside New York City are generally little changed from a year earlier. Office construction across the District continues to be sparse at best. Industrial markets, however, mostly improved in the fourth quarter, as industrial availability rates continued to trend down in Long Island and northern New Jersey, while asking rents rose moderately.
The job market overall showed further signs of strengthening in December, though contacts noted that this is a difficult time of year to gauge the market. Still, one employment agency notes that hiring activity has remained unusually robust across a range of industry sectors during this typically slow month. Another employment agency reports more of a typical seasonal lull but notes that more job candidates seem to be receiving multiple offers. Both contacts note increasing upward pressure on wages. Various contacts mention particularly strong demand for workers in information technology, human resources, customer service and trucking.
