Employment conditions have weakened a bit this summer, while very recent signs indicate some firming of consumer demand, particularly for housing. The district's agricultural outlook has remained gloomy, increasing the anxieties of agricultural lenders. Performance in natural resource-related sectors has been mixed.
Factory low-interest financing has continued to spur sales of motor vehicles. One domestic manufacturer's car sales in this region increased in July and August to levels 15 percent higher than a year earlier. This high rate of sales has left its inventories at low levels of less than one month's supply. In Great Falls, Montana, dealers for all three major domestic manufacturers experienced sales hikes two to three times greater than normal for this time of year.
Housing activity appears to have revived somewhat. Home sales in Minneapolis increased 34 percent in July and 27 percent in August over levels a year earlier. The inventory of unsold homes there is 12 percent less than it was a year ago. After dropping in June, residential building contracts in Minnesota were 39 percent higher this July than last July. District Bank directors' reports yield a mixed housing picture in the rest of the district. Sales grew in Sioux Falls and Rapid City, South Dakota, but were flat throughout the rest of the state as well as in North Dakota. While a large inventory of unsold homes remains in Rochester, Minnesota, a record number of housing permits have been issued around Iron Mountain in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
In fact, farm prices fell further recently. The Minnesota farm price index fell again in July, to 14 percent below its low level of a year ago. Soybeans registered their lowest price since January 1983. Cattle and calf prices also fell. Summarizing the meat animal business as "terrible," a Bank director from Montana notes that both fat cattle and hog prices are so low that losses are unavoidable.
Despite recent rains, crop conditions haven't improved much. At the end of August, the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared 55 of Montana's 56 counties disaster areas. Net farm income there is the lowest it's been since the Great Depression. Other parts of the district are too wet and need some warm, dry weather to foster development and harvesting of the would-be bumper crops.
