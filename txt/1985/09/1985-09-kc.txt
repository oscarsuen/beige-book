Good moisture throughout the Tenth District will favorably affect production and yield of fall harvested crops. Corn, soybean, and sorghum conditions are reported good to excellent, with bumper crops anticipated. Moisture is also good in Oklahoma, where the cotton crop is expected to be above average.
Only a small proportion of the district's wheat and grain crop will be sold. Instead, about three quarters of the wheat crop and two-thirds of the grain crop will probably go into Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loans. These proportions, which are well above average, have the potential to depress future commodity prices and thus increase the total amount spent by the federal government on deficiency payments to farmers.
Livestock production has also benefited from the good weather. Rangeland conditions are described as ideal, except in Wyoming and western Nebraska, where conditions are very poor due to extreme dryness. As a result, ranchers are moving cattle off the range prematurely and selling them at discounted prices.
