Most sectors of the Second District economy are currently showing little growth in activity and  our contacts' views of the outlook are varied. With retail sales slow except in cases of heavy promotional activity, merchants voice little optimism about the autumn. Business activity is seasonally slack in a number of areas, but some firms continue to make investments and others anticipate a pickup in orders. Office availability rates are generally high, though demand for office space in some areas is relatively strong. By contrast, the housing market remains quite active, and small District banks report no problems with consumer or mortgage loan delinquencies.
Opinions about the current state of inventories are varied. One of our contacts is satisfied with a 13 percent increase since his stocks are "clean" of leftover spring-summer goods. However, another chain finds a 10 percent increase unsatisfactory because sales levels are down. A third chain had to trim inventories by 6 percent in order to meet its plan. District retailers are not very optimistic about the outlook given the less-than-robust state of the national economy. They are concerned that consumers will remain cautious and sales gains will only come through further heavy promotions.
In contrast, the unemployment situation has improved markedly. The July unemployment rate of 6.1 percent in New York State was 2 percentage points lower than a year earlier. New York City had an even larger drop from 11.5 to 6.9 percent. New Jersey's unemployment rate, currently 6.0 percent, has been below the national level for more than a year.
Major investments continue to establish a base for future economic expansion. Ground was broken recently in the first phase of a $30 million Dunkirk Harbor Development project in western New York and construction was started on two new hotels in that same vicinity. Plans have also been announced for a 650,000 square foot shopping mall and a $28 million high-tech research and development plant in Rochester. In addition, through government assistance end tax-exempt financing, two abandoned manufacturing facilities will soon reopen: (1) an employee-owned castings firm will modernize a Binghamton area foundry which closed in 1982, and (2) a rail car assembly plant will open at the former Otis Elevator site in Yonkers.
The District's nonresidential real estate market remains seasonally inactive. Availability rates are at relatively high levels in a number of areas, and concessions by sellers and landlords continue to prevail in much of the District. Moreover, in northern New Jersey and Fairfield County demand for office space is limited to small users. Some areas of relative strength do exist, however. In Rochester, for example, contacts report that office construction is reported robust with no current vacancy problems. In downtown and mid-Manhattan the leasing of new office space is proceeding at a satisfactory pace.
