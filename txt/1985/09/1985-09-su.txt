Total employment is growing moderately, but with great variation by region. Manufacturing output, overall, is about stable. Mining, including oil and gas development, is depressed. Retail sales are somewhat stronger, but mainly disappointing. Auto sales have been stimulated by special financing. Inventories are in fairly good balance, and all types of goods readily available. General price inflation is still in checkâ€”partly because of the heavy influx of imports of a wide range of goods. Business purchases of equipment are cautious. Residential construction and demand for building materials is vigorous. Nonresidential construction is strong, but with concern about overbuilding. Bountiful harvests arc pushing down farm prices and income, and causing increasing concern over farm credits. Interest rates have not changed much in recent weeks. Private credit demand is about stable, with mortgage and consumer loans growing, and business loans soft.
