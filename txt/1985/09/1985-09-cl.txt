Auto dealers report a surge of sales in response to reduced financing rates, but looking at a longer period they see sales on a slight downtrend. This held especially for domestic dealers who say that Japanese competition is becoming a more important factor. Some domestic dealers express concern over high inventories and may significantly reduce factory orders for the rest of 1985. Some Japanese-make dealers are actually low on inventories, although they too have noticed a slowdown in demand.
A major   steel producer reports orders are getting weaker in the third   quarter and bookings for the quarter are especially weak. Steel   price pressures are intensifying as domestic producers compete   aggressively to regain market shares. Steel users are cutting   inventories because the economic outlook is uncertain and because   low capacity utilization by steel producers assures customers at   rapid delivery. A machine tool producer reports sales are up from a   year ago but by only a half to a third as much as is usually   associated with this stage at an economic expansion. The firm says   its machine tool orders are still less than half of the peak level   reached in 1979. Machine tool orders are strong from the auto and   defense industries and weak elsewhere.

A regional builder in the District reports a third consecutive month of strong ordering and heavy traffic by potential buyers. Most builders refuse to take the risk of speculative building because they are uncertain about the economy's direction. One builder asserts home buyers are not responding to lower mortgage rates because they are increasingly uncertain about whether the current economic expansion will continue.
A large mortgage lender reports exceptionally strong closings in August. The firm attributes most of the higher loan volume to availability of Ohio-subsidized mortgage funds. Some lenders find customers are considering only fixed-rate mortgages because of the small gap between fixed-rate and variable-rate mortgages and because of view that fixed rates may have reached a low point.
