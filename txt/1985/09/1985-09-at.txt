Economic conditions in the Southeast remain healthy on balance, and the outlook in several key sectors seems bright. Retail sales in August grew faster than nationally and compared to last year. The pace of residential building and sales or leasing in many regional markets continues to be brisk although multi-family and office construction are showing signs of excess supply. Bank lending, particularly to consumers, appears to have stabilized after decelerating appreciably earlier this year. Tourism business has been strong in most localities; however, Hurricane Elena drastically reduced tourist spending during the Labor Day weekend. The main areas of weakness are locally important industries, such as textiles, apparel, petrochemicals, and agriculture. The enervation of the region's manufacturing base is being felt in labor markets.
