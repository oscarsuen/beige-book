Some signs suggest that the forest products industries may be stabilizing after the troubles of the past few years, although problems remain. Some report increased  shipments to Asia as the value of the dollar falls, but attribute this movement to short-term inventory adjustments in Japan and China. They also point out that the declining value of the dollar does not improve producers' position relative to their principal competitors in Canada and the southern United States. Nevertheless, the continuing shakeout among lumber producers is yielding a leaner, lower cost, more efficient industry, which is better able to respond to these threats. One positive sign for the industry is that softwood lumber prices in October were less than 1 percent below the level of October 1984, compared to a 6 percent drop the previous year. Thus, while the downslide may be slowing, the industry remains troubled, as low-priced competition from British Columbia and the South continue to cause consternation in the Pacific Northwest.
AgricultureProducers of agricultural products continue to suffer from low prices induced by growing worldwide production and relatively weak demand. Spurred by a continuing downward price slide, cotton acreage has fallen by 300-400 thousand acres in recent years. Prices for wheat and cattle remain well below their year-ago levels, although they have inched upward in recent weeks. On the bright side, the prospects for potatoes are improving, as crop quality is good and prices are reviving from a short slide late in the summer.
Residential construction activity varies substantially within the District. Despite Oregon's economic problems, some report an upswing in residential construction activity there, particularly of multifamily units. Multifamily construction is also strong in Idaho, but gluts in Utah and Arizona have curtailed apartment and condominium developments in those areas.
Reported mortgage interest rates for 30-year fixed rate instruments hover at or below 12 percent. Several banks reported slightly lower rates than in the previous month, but one bank reduced its mortgage rate by 50 to 75 basis points during the past month. Mortgage volume appears strong overall, although there are exceptions. One Oregon bank, for example, reported that through August its volume had fallen 16.3 percent from the same period a year earlier.
The few reports on commercial loan activity suggest that it is weak. No respondents reported strong commercial loans.
