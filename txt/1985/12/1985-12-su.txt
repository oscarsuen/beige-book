Non-residential property construction and vacancy rates are uneven. Construction is reported as still strong in some parts of the Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts. San Francisco reports high commercial vacancy rates in many areas are causing construction permits to slow. New York reports that overall demand for commercial real estate generally remains satisfactory and that work has recently begun on a "$10 billion community planned for the New Jersey waterfront across from Manhattan." Chicago and Dallas report strong road building and repaving activity.
