The Second District economy has maintains its improved tone in recent weeks. A higher percentage of purchasing managers reports better business conditions, and consumer spending has recovered from its September slowdown. Residential building remains strong while demand in the commercial real estate market is satisfactory. Small banks in the District note an increasing use of fixed fees rather than compensating balances in the pricing of business loan commitments.
Inventories that were trimmed to desired levels last summer began to climb during the September slowdown. Although several merchants managed to reduce stocks to planned levels by the end of October, others report an excess. Inventories are currently being increased to meet the Christmas demand, but stores that have had abrupt sales shortfalls are adopting a conservative posture. Since the 1985 Christmas season will be a week shorter than 1984, some retailers will push Christmas items earlier than usual.
The outlook for the District's manufacturing sector is unclear. On the negative side, several firm have recently announced plans to move from or reduce their operations in the region. One of the largest such reductions could occur over the next two years at an auto parts manufacturer. While apparently still open to discussion, this move to a lower-cost area could affect some 1,100 District workers. More positively, General Motors plans a $340 million expansion program at a car engine factory. Elsewhere in the District, ground was recently broken for a $125 million state-of-the-art chemical plant. And an Air Force contract recently awarded to a District aerospace firm should provide additional employment.
By far the biggest new project announced for the District is a $10 billion community planned for the New Jersey waterfront across from Manhattan. Work was recently begun on the first phase of this project: four high-rise apartment buildings and a shopping center. By 1995 this new community is expected to include hotels, office buildings, parks, cultural facilities, a large marina, waterfront stores and restaurants, and up to 9,000 residential units.
The District's commercial real estate market appeared stable in recent weeks with only minor changes reported in rents and vacancy rates. While few large-scale transactions are taking place, overall demand generally remains satisfactory except in some parts of northern New Jersey. There is still concern, however, about the outlook in lower Manhattan and Fairfield County where older office space is being vacated by tenants moving to newly-constructed buildings.
