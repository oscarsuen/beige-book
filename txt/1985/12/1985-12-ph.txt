Economic conditions in the Third District in late October and early November appear to be improving. Manufacturing activity is turning up after several flat months and retailers report sales in line with optimistic expectations. Consumer and commercial lending is growing at a slightly faster pace now than earlier in the fall.
Expectations about Third District conditions are mixed, although generally optimistic. Manufacturers look for business to improve and plan to step up capital spending over the next six months. Retailers are somewhat uncertain about the strength of upcoming holiday sales at this point; nevertheless, they predict healthy sales for 1985 as a whole. Bankers expect commercial loan demand to remain strong for the fourth quarter and they say that current consumer loan demand levels can be maintained or increased with possible interest rate reductions.
Manufacturers note improvement in the levels of new orders and shipments, but report little change in employment. Industrial prices in the Third District are stable; over three-fourths of the manufacturers polled say neither input costs nor output prices have changed this month.
Third District manufacturers are generally optimistic about the near future. A third of the November survey respondents expect the current level of activity to continue over the next six months, and about half anticipate further growth. Manufacturers expect increases in new orders and shipments, and are planning to step up capital spending. Durable goods makers, however, foresee some weakening in employment.
As the Christmas selling season approaches, Third District retailers are stepping up promotional efforts that, they say, are necessary to maintain store traffic. Department store and general merchandise executives are still uncertain about prospects for holiday sales, and are reluctant to make forecasts until they see post-Thanksgiving results. Some merchants have expressed concern that consumers may have reached their limit of comfort on installment debt, and that this may dampen end-of-year sales. One major chain, however, reports that credit purchases are growing as a percentage of sales.
Consumer loan volume increased approximately 1.5 percent in October to about 18 percent above its year-ago level. Some Third District banks report that demand for consumer installment loans has been very responsive to lower interest rates and promotional efforts and that further reductions in rates may be made in the near future.
Local bank economists have scaled back their predictions of growth for the next two quarters. Consequently, they have lowered their interest rate forecasts for the next six months. Their predictions now range from a general increase of up to 50 basis points to drops of 50 basis points or more in yields on Treasury securities of all maturities. They also expect a comparable drop in the federal funds rate.
