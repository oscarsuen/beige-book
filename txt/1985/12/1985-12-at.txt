The weather has combined with some other factors to cloud the economic picture of the Southeast economy in the fall. As summarized by the broad unemployment rate yardstick, the regional economy weakened somewhat in September. With the ending of cheap auto financing deals, car-buying plummeted in October, pulling down consumer spending. Total consumer borrowing has slowed as buyers' appetites apparently have been temporarily satiated. Construction activity indicators show that sector rebounding in response to easing credit conditions. The pace of tourism has been uneven and below last year's Fair-boosted levels in some states, and wet weather has further depressed farm revenue estimates, particularly in Louisiana.
