While employment growth has slowed in the Ninth District this fall, several positive developments have occurred in the labor market. Consumer spending generally fell in October, but it my be rebounding in November. Sharp increases in cattle and hog prices are the main bright spots in the agricultural sector, where future farm finance remains a major concern.
Major labor market developments in the district included the long-awaited reopening of the old White Pine mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Also, a Bank director notes that a preliminary agreement was signed to build and operate a big paper mill in the hard-pressed area around Duluth, Minnesota. In Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a large, divisive strike at a meat-packing plant was settled. But in Livingston, Montana, a railroad closed its repair operation, causing that area to lose 350 jobs.
Motor vehicle ales have slowed, following an avalanche of September orders. Regional offices of domestic manufacturers report that car and truck sales were lower during this October than during last October. Inventories, which were very low earlier this fall, have now increased to more comfortable levels. The Bank's directors from North and South Dakota report that vehicle sales in their vicinities were still slow in November.
Housing activity continued to pick up in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, but activity was spotty elsewhere in the district. In the Twin Cities, home sales were 12 percent higher during this September and October than they were during these months last year. Residential construction contracts in Minnesota were substantially higher this September than last. But while Bank directors find that housing starts were up in the area around Great Falls, Montana, they also note that activity was down around Bismarck, North Dakota, and in western North Dakota.
In general, tourist expenditures in both summer and fall appeared to have increased from 1984. levels. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the increase appeared to be about 5 percent. Good tourism activity in both northwestern Wisconsin and western Montana was also noted by the Bank's Advisory Council.
