Coal production continues to run slightly below year ago levels, but recent employment losses appear to have been stemmed in this industry as well. Nonetheless, mining employment remains well below the levels of a year ago. There is generally widespread feeling that output of coal will be on the rise shortly. Consumption, particularly by electric utilities, is running strong, and stocks on hand are down sharply from only a few moths ago.
The reported weakness in sales of goods has not spread to tourist related services, however. Most reports are that tourist areas are doing quite well, so well, in fact, that they are exhibiting more general economic strength, such as in commercial and residential construction.
