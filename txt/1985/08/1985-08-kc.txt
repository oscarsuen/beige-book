Conditions of spring crops and ranges generally are good across the district. Corn and soybean conditions are reported good to excellent in Missouri, Kansas, and eastern Nebraska. However, corn and soybeans in western Nebraska are suffering from extreme dryness and grasshopper infestations, while the condition of the Colorado corn crop is reported to be spotty. Adequate moisture has provided good range conditions in the eastern portion of the Tenth District. However, the western part of the district is experiencing extremely dry range conditions. Due to poor crop conditions, ranchers in Wyoming are moving their cattle to market and selling at discounted prices. Cattle are also moving to market in western Nebraska, but toa lesser degree.
Agricultural lenders throughout the district report that land acquired by financial institutions through foreclosure or liquidation is being moved onto the market with little or no delay. Moreover, banks in all district states report that they are taking market prices for farm real estate, and often setting no minimum at auction.
Many farm equipment dealers in the district remain in financial difficulty. Producers and sellers of farm equipment continue to cut back on inventories and number of employees. Farm equipment sales in Oklahoma have declined dramatically from the already low levels of a year ago.
