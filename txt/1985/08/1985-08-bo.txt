First District merchants remain optimistic about the second half of  the year. Despite several months of sales below plan, contacts have not lowered their plans for the remainder of 1985 because they have confidence in the New England economy's basic strength. Unemployment is low in the region and local retailers report that they continue to outperform many of their national affiliates.
While there has been little change in overall order rates, demand for housing related products such as appliances and lighting is picking up. The capital goods picture is mixed. Some products, such as factory automation systems and construction equipment, are doing reasonably well. However, a lot of capital goods spending is for imports. Especially weak at the present time is the demand for parts and components from industries, like machine tools, that are losing market share to imports.
Most of the firms contacted are proceeding as planned with their capital spending programs. One contact, that had previously reduced its capital plans in response to weak demand, has made a substantial upward revision. Inventories are said to be in good shape - even at firms facing sluggish demand. A close watch is also being kept on employment levels. A couple of contacts have had small layoffs. One firm, enjoying strong sales, is relying on temporary help rather then permanent hires to meet the increased demand.
