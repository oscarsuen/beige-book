The wood products sector presents a mixed picture. While stronger than in the recent past, problems remain with competition from Canada and the strong U.S. dollar. Some firms continue layoffs and wage freezes, but others are returning laid off employees to work. In general, Oregon appears to be healthier than Washington. For example, one Oregon firm had strong paper earnings and orders in June, and expects a strong summer. In contrast, a Washington paper firm reports weakness in paper related to lower prices which now barely cover costs. One potential source of optimism in Washington is the weakening dollar, which has slowed the price decline. However, pressure on costs is sufficiently severe that production increases do not result necessarily in more jobs.
Mining sectors remain weak, with low prices and reduced employment in petroleum. With the exception of major gold mining and refining operations which have realized recent strength, there is no sign of improvement in the beleaguered mineral mining sector.
In some markets, signals are mixed. For example, in Idaho, May residential permits were 28 percent below May 1984, but the value of commercial construction was 45 percent above May 1984.
Nevertheless, there are some bright spots (lamb prices, for example, are up substantially), and western agriculture's ability to switch acreage to more profitable crops remains a source of long run optimism.
