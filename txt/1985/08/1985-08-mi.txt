District labor market conditions haven't worsened lately, despite the deepening agricultural crisis. Consumer spending appears to have slackened, though, particularly in drought-plagued agricultural areas. Summer construction and tourist spending have helped many district states weather the lack of storms.
Sales of motor vehicles have been seasonally slow, as consumers wait for new models to cone out. Reflecting this, one domestic manufacturer reports that both car and track sales were off in July. Another manufacturer reports higher June truck sales, though. Both manufacturers have more than adequate inventories.
Home sales have been strong lately in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. There home sales in June were 20.7 percent above their high levels of a year earlier. At the same time, though, in North Dakota new housing starts were up only about 2 percent, and district Bank directors haven't reported much home building activity in agricultural areas.
Tourist expenditures have been generally up. Through June, inquiries at Minnesota state tourism offices were 27 percent ahead of last year. The big, multipurpose resorts are doing better than the small fishing resorts. A Bank director reports that a national park in North Dakota was busy in June, being visited by more people this year than last. A director from Montana notes that tourism to Yellowstone Park was up 18 percent this year. Finally, a bakery which serves northwestern Wisconsin and parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan reports that its sales were up, a good indicator of overall tourist expenditures in its service area.
Farmers in less heat-stressed parts of the district are still suffering from low prices. The Minnesota farm price index finally steadied in July, but still remained 14 percent below list July's level. A recent decrease in milk price supports is expected to cost Minnesota dairy farmers around $50 million a year.  Milk prices in Minnesota in July were the lowest in five years.
