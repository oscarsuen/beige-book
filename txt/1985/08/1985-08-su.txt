The economy remains sluggish. Retail sales have been disappointing, but some districts see signs of a pickup in July. Despite the weakness in retail sales, inventories remain under control. The manufacturing sector is stagnating; orders and shipments are flat and employment seems to be declining. Residential and nonresidential construction continues to be a source of strength; several districts report increased activity. Consumer lending continues to rise. Commercial lending is up in some districts and down in others. Agricultural prices are below year ago levels and decreasing. While harvests are expected to be good in general, some parts of the country are suffering from very dry weather and grasshopper infestations.
Automobile and light truck sales are up in a number of districts but down in others. Foreign cars are said to be selling better than domestic, at least partly because the loosening of quotas for Japanese cars has increased availability. Economic activity in resort areas is stronger than last summer, although New York reports reduced foreign tourism.
Experience varies among districts, however. For example, while Richmond reports that textiles, apparel and furniture are losing market share to imports, Dallas observes that apparel orders are well above year ago levels and furniture makers in the Atlanta district are looking forward to increased sales.
Reductions in manufacturing employment are taking place in a number of Districts including some in which manufacturing activity is flat or up slightly. Chicago reports deep cutbacks in such industries as steel, capital goods and electronics.
The mining sector remains weak, with activity generally below year ago levels. There have been a few encouraging developments, however. In the Richmond district coal production is expected to increase shortly because stocks have been drawn down sharply. Gold mining has strengthened in the San Francisco district. Dallas reports that the rate of decline in drilling appears to be slowing, with the seasonally adjusted rig count actually increasing in July.
Nonresidential construction activity is strong in a number of districts. Construction has increased substantially in the St. Louis district while Chicago and Dallas report small advances. Dallas observes that the city of Dallas is now said to lead the nation in vacant office space; New York also notes that vacancy rates remain high.
Chicago reports continuing declines in farmland values; however, Dallas finds that the decline in land values in its district abated in the second quarter.
