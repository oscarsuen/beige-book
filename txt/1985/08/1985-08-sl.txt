Automobile dealer associations in the District report first-half 1985 sales to be up 5 to 10 percent over first-half 1984 levels. Most dealers feel the sales strength will continue through the second half of 1985, although one large St. Louis domestic car dealer believes second half sales will fall from current levels. The strong sales are reported to be evenly distributed among car and truck sales; foreign car dealers are posting 10 to 20 percent sales increases over last year's levels.
