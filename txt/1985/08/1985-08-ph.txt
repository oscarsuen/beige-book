Economic conditions in the Third District appear to have improved slightly in July. Manufacturing activity has picked up marginally after a flat three months and retail sales have rebounded from an unexpected dip in June. Both commercial and consumer loan volume continue to grow at area banks, although somewhat more slowly than in the first half. Early indications are that tourism business in the Third District this summer is better than it was in the disappointing 1984 season.
The outlook for the Third District economy is positive. Manufacturers generally expect business conditions to remain stable or to improve over the next six months and anticipate increased capital spending. Area retailers are pleased with the recently regained strength of sales and expect a good third quarter. Bankers predict renewed economic growth and foresee demand for commercial credit increasing near the end of the year.
In their outlook for the next six months, most area manufacturers are optimistic. Over 85 percent of the July survey respondents believe business conditions during the next six months will be the same or better than they are now, and more than 40 percent forecast gains in both new orders and shipments. Prospects for greater capital expenditures have improved slightly. Twenty-?? percent of the companies contacted in July plan increased outlays for plant and equipment over the next six months, up from 20 percent in June. The employment situation is not likely to improve, however; more than half of the industrial establishments surveyed this month plan no changes in either employment levels or working hours, and more than one-fourth expect to make workforce reductions between now and January 1986.
Retailers are optimistic about the third quarter, anticipating an increase in sales of approximately 6 percent over the same period last year on a same-store basis. New stores opened in the Third District by major chains in recent months are doing well, and, despite a slower than expected spring, inventories have been kept under control.
Third District bankers expect loan growth in most categories to continue at the present pace for the next several months, then pick up at the end of the year. Some believe that commercial lending, especially to middle market companies, may move up sharply as economic growth accelerates into 1986. Agreeing with this outlook, local bank economists expect credit conditions to become tighter near the end of the year. They say that interest rates may be driven up by federal government borrowing requirements and increased private sector credit demand, coupled with greater restraint by the Fed. They place the prime rate at 10 percent or more by year-end, the federal funds rate near 9 percent, and long-term Treasury bond rates at 11 percent.
