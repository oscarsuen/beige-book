Although manufacturing employment in the District has shown little change of late, there are reports that the average work week may have been shortened. Also, manufacturers continue to report weakness in prices. There are even suggestions that prices may have declined in recent weeks.
Despite the apparent slowing of demand, and an increasing sentiment for retrenchment, District manufacturers actually seem to have become more positive about the outlook. They foresee little change in the level of activity nationally in coming months, but, on balance, expect conditions on their respective markets and firms to improve in that time frame.
Coal production has been disrupted by very bad weather since the first of the year, and is running somewhat below year ago levels. It is likely though that even with good weather, 1984 output would be unmatched at this point. Production is still at relatively high levels by historical standards.
The price discounting that 	became so prevalent around year end continues generally, although there seems to be a modest trend toward rebuilding margins. It remains to be seen how successful these efforts will be. Retailers as a group seem to be quite optimistic, calling for littlechange or modest increases in activity in coming months.
Similarly, commercial construction is very strong, unprecedented in several metropolitan areas. Office buildings and shopping centers seem to dominate the activity. The outlook for this sector is also positive. Reports suggest that new projects are continuing to come on line at all stages.
