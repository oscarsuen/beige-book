The land market continues very soft, with very little land changing hands. Parts of Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado report that about 15 to 20 percent of the land in the area is for sale. Parts of Wyoming and Colorado report much higher proportions of land for sale, though the proportion is affected by nonagricultural uses of the land. In Missouri and parts of Nebraska and New Mexico, very little land is actually listed for sale, though bankers indicate that this is probably due to a lack of buyers, not an unwillingness to sell.
Most bankers continue to be wary of the FmMA program to restructure farm debt because of bureaucratic procedures that slow loan guarantee approvals. Moreover, many loans require a significant interest rate reduction to achieve a break-even cash flow. Many bankers appear reluctant to lower rates enough to meet the requirements. Participation in the program is heaviest in Kansas and parts of Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Colorado. Some bankers continue to ignore the program completely.
