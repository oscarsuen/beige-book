The southeastern economy continued to expand in early 1985. Employment has increased in several basic manufacturing industries although some other manufacturers remain burdened by competition from imports. Sluggish consumer spending growth accompanied a severe mid-winter cold spell, but sales of new vehicles remain very robust. Housing markets are generally firm while still-booming office, retail and industrial construction shows signs of outpacing high levels of absorption. Business and real estate lending growth corroborates the moderately strong economic advance of the region. Tourism activity measures indicate that current and expected business and convention travel is strong. The agricultural sector continues to be the major soft spot, with prices for some important products falling and those for some others still depressed.
The region's tire plants, which have been running near capacity, recently increased their production schedules, and paper manufacturers are adding capacity to meet demand. A major steel producer has recalled 650 employees to its north Alabama plant, including some who have been laid off since 1980. Louisiana's petrochemical industry is producing at high levels for the specialty chemical segment, but the larger agricultural segment is not faring well due to foreign competition and the plight of the farmer. Petroleum refiners continue to trim operations.
Record-breaking trade deficits for apparel and textile products have resulted in mill layoffs throughout the region. Apparel fabric producers have been especially vulnerable to imports. The number of textile jobs declined by 2,000 in Georgia alone in early 1985. Industry spokesmen fear that their heavy domestic investment in productivity-enhancing equipment has not reversed the industry's declining trend. In contrast to other textile sectors, carpet sales are reaching record levels due to a sharp upturn in commercial contract orders. Carpet sales are expected to grow by 10 percent this year based on the office building boom.
