The employment picture remained very strong, although there were a few early signs of a possible slowdown. Employment in both New York and New Jersey remained at record high levels, unemployment rates were well below the national average, and several major employers have indicated their intention either to maintain or to increase employment in the District during 1985. However, layoffs and plant closings have become somewhat more prevalent. Firms announcing contractions included a drug manufacturer in northern New Jersey, a typewriter maker and a bottle manufacturer in upstate New York, and an aerospace producer on Long Island.
The housing market nay be affected by several bills pending before state legislatures. In New York the renewal of rent regulations and various tax incentives are being considered; New Jersey's legislature is debating action on court-ordered low-income housing construction in suburban areas. Proposed bills in both states would also increase subsidies for low- and middle-income housing construction, directly and through reduced-interest mortgages.
Real estate brokers in many parts of the area noted that the nonresidential real estate market has stabilized in recent weeks, even though inventories were on the high side. The demand for office space has increased in Downtown Manhattan, owing in part to the recent strength of the stock market and the banking sector. Leasing activity was high in Midtown Manhattan and on Long Island. In contrast, demand was weak in northern New Jersey and Fairfield County in Connecticut, and observers believed that the large extent of speculative building underway in these areas has not been warranted by the current rate of space absorption. Westchester County (New York) has been an intermediate case: demand was viewed as satisfactory but large additions of new space next spring nay upset the current equilibrium.
