With the exception of agriculture and some resource-related activities, the Ninth District economy has shown signs of strength so far this year. Nonfarm employment indicators have generally remained good, consumer spending in diversified cities has picked up a bit, and loans and deposits at large city banks have both grown.
After a slow start in January, motor vehicle sales picked up considerably in February. The regional office of one large domestic manufacturer reports that sales in late February were high enough to bring current year-to-date sales up to levels of a year ago. Another manufacturer says its trucks sold particularly well recently, leaving its inventory levels in the low-to- normal range. Dealers in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Fargo, North Dakota, also report good auto sales.
The pace of home buying has been generally at or above that of a year ago. Through February, Twin Cities home sales were up 14 percent over a year earlier. Both listings and housing permits were up there, too. According to scattered reports, housing activity was fairly good in Rochester, Minnesota, and Fargo, North Dakota. But home sales in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, were lower this January than last.
Tourist expenditures at ski resorts in northwestern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were harmed somewhat by warm weather late in February. They are expected to pick up soon, though. A lot of snow usually falls early in March. And a new hotel was just finished in Escanaba, Michigan.
