Many firms in this District report continued strong competition from imports is restraining price increases and keeping profit margins small. A containers producer reports a continued shift from glass containers to plastic and paper substitutes. A producer of personal safety equipment used in industry had strong earnings in 1984 and expects a strong 1985. Some chemicals factories in southern Ohio are operating at capacity.
Major steel producers report some pickup in orders from the automobile industry and steel service centers, but transactions prices remain well below published prices because of excess domestic capacity and strong competition from imports. Steel inventories remain high. A steel mill in western Pennsylvania recently announced a 500-worker layoff.
Capital goods producers have mixed views on the report that domestic firms plan a 6.8% real increase in expenditures on plant and equipment in 1985. One firm, which expects a recession to begin no later than the second half, expects the real change in business fixed investment to be negative, partly because of uncertainty about tax law changes. Another firm thinks the figure is on the mark while a third expects a 10% real increase.
Coal mining remains a depressed industry. Many workers are on a three-day week, and improvement is not expected until late-1985 when excessive stockpiles will have been worked down. Falling oil prices have depressed oil and gas drilling activity in this District.
Realtors, who remain the most optimistic among market participants, experienced further improvement in December in listings and contracts closed. There are some signs that the move-up market is reversing its flat performance of 1984. Realtors' optimism is reflected in one District firm's plan to open three times as many new franchises during 1985 as in 1984.
Mortgage lending volume is expanding because of lower mortgage rates, and one lender reports that loan volume in December was 50% higher than a year earlier. Lenders anticipate that the resumed popularity of the fixed rate mortgage will persist until the second half of 1985, when they expect rates to rise. Lenders will sell most new fixed-rate mortgages in the secondary market if commitment rates are favorable.
Builders remain extremely cautious. New orders remain sluggish, and buyer traffic, which a major builder reports was up 11% nationally in December, fell 35% in Ohio. Because of poor earnings in 1984, builders are positioning to minimize downside risk.
