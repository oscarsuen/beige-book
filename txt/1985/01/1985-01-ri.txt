Whether because of the recent decline in business activity or for other reasons, attitudes and expectations among District manufacturers also seem to have deteriorated of late. There is spreading concern over inventory levels and over excess plant and equipment capacity, although there is virtually no sentiment for changing current expansion plans. The outlook is also somewhat weaker than in recent months. Although manufacturers, on balance, seem to expect little change in output at their own firms, there is a slight preponderance of sentiment favoring declining activity at the national and market levels over the next six months. Despite these losses in activity and changes in attitudes, however, employment seems to be making further gains, at least apart from the textile and apparel industries.
