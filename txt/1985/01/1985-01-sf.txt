The recovery of the economy of the Twelfth District was continuing at year end. The pace of the recovery in November and December was considerably slower than in the first half of the year, but there did not seem to be any signs of increasing weakness or recession. Indeed, buoyed by declining interest rates, home purchases and purchases of consumer durables and automobiles appeared to be up slightly from a few months ago. Manufacturing employment continues to grow and in most states in the District, unemployment rates continue to fall. Agriculture remains weak as a result of depressed export demand and strong crop yields.
Sales of new automobiles, however, were spurred by the sharp reductions in short-term interest rates that occurred toward the end of the year. In Oregon, for example, automobile sales early in the fourth quarter had grown by 24 percent in one month. Sales of other consumer durables—particularly consumer electronics items—remain healthy but sales growth over 1983 has been modest.
Mining also remains weak as a result of low prices and stiff competition from foreign producers. Throughout the District, however, the weakness in the wood products and mining industries has been offset by growth in other manufacturing industries and the services sector. In states like Oregon and Idaho, these developments are almost perfectly offsetting and unemployment rates have remained quite steady over the last several months. In California, however, the strength of the aerospace and electrical equipment industries has led to continued, gradual declines in unemployment rates. In Santa Clara County, California, the center of the nation's high technology industry, the fourth quarter unemployment rate was less than 4 percent.
The recent decline in market rates has narrowed the spread between jumbo CD rates, money market fund yields, and MMDA rates, and altered banks' deposit flows and funding pattern. The lower rates appear to have led some banks and consumers to lock in longer term deposits, resulting in strong increases in both jumbo CDs and small denomination time deposits in December. The elimination of the differential between money funds and MMDA rates also resulted in renewed inflows into MMDAs; these deposits grew very rapidly in December. Most institutions, in the West expect the recent reduction in minimum balance requirements on MMDAs and SNOWs to have little effect on inflows into these accounts, although the reduced minimums may lead to more tiering of rates and fees.
