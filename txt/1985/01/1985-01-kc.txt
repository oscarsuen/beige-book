Paydowns on agricultural loans at the end of 1984 were below average in most of the Tenth District, and below earlier expectations. Bankers in Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Colorado estimate that 50 to 90 percent of their farm borrowers made unsatisfactory or no loan paydowns in 1984. Several Tenth District banks report that 5 to 10 percent of their farm borrowers will receive no more credit. As a result, agricultural lenders expect to see more liquidations in 1985, and, therefore, they expect to experience losses.
Interest rates on operating loans have continued to decline, with rates ranging from 12.75 to 14.5 percent. Agricultural lenders in all district states but Oklahoma report interest rates falling by as much as one and a half percentage points over the past eight weeks. In Oklahoma, however, rates are largely unchanged at 14 to 14.5 percent.
