The economic expansion continued in most districts. The pace of recovery, although slower than early in the year, was moderately strong at year end. Retail sales activity during the holiday season was satisfactory and, in some cases, better than expected. Home sales and construction activity appeared to have rebounded significantly in response to declining mortgage interest rates. Manufacturing, employment and output continues to grow in most districts and manufacturers are reportedly optimistic about future sales prospects. The major sources of weakness appear to be agriculture and the mining and minerals industries. Overall, however, most districts report favorable trends in unemployment and continued low inflation.
