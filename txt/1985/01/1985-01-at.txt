The southeastern economy continued to strengthen toward the year's end. Employment growth was noted even in the more depressed areas of the region. Consumer spending, which had been disappointing in the mid-holiday-shopping period, revived toward Christmas, and post-Christmas sales activity also was brisk. Commercial construction remains active, and the pace of home building quickened, owing to further declines in mortgage interest rates. Bank lending to consumers increased in early January, suggesting that demand for automobiles remained strong. A mild winter relative to the rest of the country boosted tourist activity. On the other hand, real estate and business lending by banks was soft. Many crop farmers, adversely affected earlier by heavy rainfall and flooding, are now suffering from low prices for corn and soybeans.
Strength in paper, petrochemical, defense and aerospace industries overshadow lingering weaknesses in import-sensitive sectors. High operating rates have encouraged some paper plants to expand. Demand for linerboard and bonded paper is particularly strong, and prices are firm. Activity in Louisiana's petrochemical industry continued to brighten as evidenced by higher levels of offshore drilling, growth plans for capital spending, and reductions in inventories. Defense-related spending and aerospace production continue to augment the region's economic activity. Defense-related work doubled at Oak Ridge Laboratories from 1983 to 1984, and spokesmen expect a 25 percent improvement in 1985.
On the other hand, several important sectors have experienced little improvement of late. Employment declined further in the region's steel and textile sectors during December. Although falling long-term interest rates have aided home building, inflows of Canadian lumber are still a concern of the region's lumber and wood product producers.
Construction. Residential construction reversed a decline early in the fourth quarter as mortgage interest rates eased and a feared plunge in economic activity failed to materialize. Home builders expect further declines in mortgage rates to extend the recent strength in building through the first half of 1985.
Nonresidential construction continued to grow in early January. Although property managers consider the region's office market to be overbuilt, recent increases in rental rates should provide some relief. Shopping center construction continued to increase in December even though merchants contend that competition is already intense.
