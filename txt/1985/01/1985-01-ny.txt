IntroductionEconomic activity in the Second District advanced at an uneven pace in recent weeks. Consumer spending strengthened during December and on into early January. The demand for new homes was also strong and residential builders are quite optimistic about their prospects in 1985. While overall employment reached record levels, district purchasing managers for the most part reported that production and new orders were unchanged in December. The absorption of office space remains slow in many areas with vacancy rates showing little improvement.
The inventory situation among District retailers was mixed at year-end. While most reported stocks at comfortable levels, some expressed the need to reduce excess inventories in the weeks ahead.
The absorption of new office space remains slow in many parts of the District and vacancy rates in these areas showed little improvement. In northern New Jersey, Westchester and Fairfield counties, observers report that markets are relatively soft and leasing activity is slow. Manhattan is a major exception where demand continues strong in midtown and some large space users recently signed leases in the downtown area. Another exception is Long Island where commercial leasing is described as fairly brisk with a resultant reduction of inventories there.
Plans for several new or expanded industrial projects have recently been announced. Among these are a record $554 million in capital expenditures scheduled by a Rochester manufacturer for 1985, a $200 million natural gas co-generation plant to be built in Syracuse, and a $125 million expansion by an upstate paper maker. In addition, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority plan to convert several buildings which were abandoned when firms left Yonkers and Elizabeth into two new industrial parks.
Employment continues at record high levels in New York and New Jersey. Moreover, during 1984 New York City had its largest employment gain since record-keeping began in 1950. December unemployment rates were at or below the national [seasonally adjusted rate of 7.3] percent in both New York State and New Jersey.
