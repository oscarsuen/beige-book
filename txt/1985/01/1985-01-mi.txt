The Ninth District economy has grown at a modest rate in the last few months. Employment conditions have remained stable, with hire-backs in mining offsetting new layoffs in manufacturing. Consumer spending, while not as strong as some merchants hoped, has generally surpassed the previous year's excellent performance. Encouraging signs have appeared in commercial and industrial construction. Financial activity has been normal for this time of year. But little improvement has occurred in the hard-pressed agriculture sector.
While regional auto sales dropped this December from the unusually strong levels of a year earlier, they picked up some in January. For example, one large domestic manufacturer reports that its district car and truck sales fell more than 20 percent this December, but still were better than in most years. Several of' this Bank's directors note similar soft November and December vehicle sales in their areas of the district. Auto inventories have reportedly increased recently from generally low 1984 levels. But regional sales managers for domestic manufacturers report a big sales pickup early in January.
Housing activity also appears to have slowed and rebounded in the last few months. Twin Cities home sales fell off a bit in November from the pace of a year earlier. Primarily due to a reduction in multifamily buildings, the number of Twin Cities housing permits this November also did not reach its year-earlier level. The value of Twin Cities residential construction contract awards did increase strongly in November, though. Future permit figures should reflect this increase.
Adequate snowfall has helped district ski resorts attract tourist dollars this winter. Ski areas in Montana and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan report good skiing conditions.
