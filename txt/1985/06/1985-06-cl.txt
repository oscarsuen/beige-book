The pattern of economic activity in the Fourth District has changed little since the last Beigebook. District employment rose slightly in May, although manufacturing employment was unchanged. Cars and soft goods continue to sell well, while big ticket department store hardgoods are beginning to recover from weak sales in mid-spring. Manufacturing production remains flat, with output strong in automobiles and weak in steel. Firms continue emphasis on cost-cutting modernization rather than expansion. Multi-family residential construction remains volatile because of tax law uncertainty while office construction is being reduced because of excess space. Business loan demand has been flat while real estate and consumer installment loan demand has been good.
In contrast to auto dealers, department stores report that sales of big-ticket items like furniture and appliances have been weak since mid-April. These items are beginning to recover and retailers believe this may be due to the arrival of tax refunds. Apparel and other soft goods continued to move exceedingly well and sellers expect this trend to continue. Retailers are optimistic about the rest of 1985. Inventories are at desired levels and most stores do not expect to cut prices further. They hope to recover some of their margins lost to earlier discounting by a continued drop in their costs for some goods.
Manufacturers of automobiles and automobile and truck parts report that their capital spending is almost entirely for modernization rather than expansion of capacity. Even when a new plant is built it is usually to replace an old, inefficient plant. One manufacturer of truck parts reports that orders are being stretched out but not cancelled. The firm's cash flow is weakening, so the firm may cut back its spending on plant and equipment. Despite a sharp increase in imports, an auto producer will not cut prices because it is operating at full capacity. Major steel producers continue in distress. Prices remain soft, imports high, and profits low or negative. Most major steel producers are reducing their costs butthe benefits seem to go into lower prices rather than higher profit margins.
Office construction in the District's major cities has been robust since 1980, resulting in an oversupply of office space. Consequently, all of this District's major cities are currently experiencing a substantial downtrending or complete stoppage in new contracts for office construction, which is expected to persist over the next three to four years. Generally speaking, the office construction market is best characterized as an "orderly buyers' market," inasmuch as prices are being discounted 10 percent to 20 percent but suppliers are not panicky.
