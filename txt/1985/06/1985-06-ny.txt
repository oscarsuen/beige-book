Activity in most sectors of the Second District economy slowed in recent weeks. Sluggishness of consumer spending has continued for the last few months, although many stores in the area were still doing somewhat better than for the nation as a whole. Fewer firms reported improving business conditions than did earlier in the year. Commercial real estate brokers indicated growing concern that their "boom" my be over. A major bright spot was in residential construction, where homebuilders reported the best market conditions in years. On the financial side, consumer loan rates began to decline, reflecting the trend in general market interest rates.
Major capital investment projects continued to be announced, however, including two joint ventures involving foreign investors. Toshiba and Westinghouse will retool and restaff an Elmira plant (which had been closed for nine years) to produce TV tubes and computer display screens. In addition, the government of Yugoslavia will participate in a project to convert part of Bethlehem Steel's abandoned Lackawana plant to an aluminum mill. These undertakings would add several hundred jobs to areas facing persistently high unemployment rates.
Other large projects recently begun or announced in the District include the construction of a new shopping mall and the expansion of two existing ones in Niagara County, as well as a new financial center and corporate headquarters in downtown Albany.
The New York City government has proposed major zoning revisions to reduce the construction costs for apartment houses. The changes could encourage the construction of up to 5,000 now units annually, at 25 percent below current costs, according to the City's estimates.
Real estate brokers are becoming concerned that the "boom" in the region's office market may be over. Availability rates remain very high, over 20 percent in some areas, yet net absorption is not increasing. The outlook is uncertain, with the strength of commercial construction depending on the performance of the general economy in the coming months.
Our contacts also expressed uncertainty regarding the impact of the President's tax proposals. Most agreed that real estate would be a less attractive investment, especially to small investors and syndications. A slower pace of investment could depress property values, at least in the short run, but one observer was optimistic about the longer-term stimulus of the tax plan. Some brokers also believed that investment in Manhattan and Long Island might be discouraged to some extent by the elimination of state and local tax deductibility. Fairfield County (Connecticut) and northern New Jersey might derive some relative benefit.
