Recent developments are reportedly adding to the pressure on the cooperative Farm Credit System. Stock requirements of several PCAs in Iowa were frozen. In addition, the Omaha FLB raised its farm mortgage rates 75 basis points. These developments reportedly triggered a "flight" of good borrowers from PCAs and FLBs to other lenders. In some cases, the flight has been encouraged by heavy advertising of lower rate loans on the part of competitive lenders.
