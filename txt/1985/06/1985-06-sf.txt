The economy of the Twelfth District, in general, continues to be healthy. Activity weakened by the continued strength of the dollar appears to have been partly offset by the stimulus provided by recent declines in interest rates. The semiconductor industry, for example, has weakened considerably since last year but home construction activity is proceeding at long-term trend levels. Retail sales activity also has been generally vigorous, although there is considerable variation in retail sales growth reported within the District. The agricultural sector, although still struggling to overcome the problems of the high value of the dollar and extensive debt obligations, does not appear to be losing ground. The forest products industry and the mining industry also continue to be weakened by the strength of the dollar and by local productioncost problems. Fortunately, in those states in which these industries are important, growth in the service sector or in manufacturing activity has helped to avoid the more serious implications of continued weakness in these industries.
Automobile sales also are reported as being up from last year due in part to consumer awareness of increased price competition as the result of elimination of Japanese import restrictions. In California last month, the import share of the automobile market was above 50 percent.
Construction activity generally is strong. In California, housing starts are running at the rate of 230,000 units per year, up 4 percent from the first quarter of 1984. In Utah, housing starts are down from last year, but non-residential construction activity is up nearly 40 percent. Generally speaking, vacancy rates in manufacturing facilities appear to be drifting upward, whereas vacancy rates in commercial structures are declining. This has been particularly important in the overbuilt Wilshire corridor in Los Angeles.
Despite relatively healthy construction activity, the forest products industry in the Pacific Northwest continues to be plagued by local labor problems, strong competition far plywood products from Japanese imports and competition for other wood products from Canada. Lumber exports out of the Port of Portland decreased by 58 percent between the first quarters of 1984 and 1985.
Mining and smelting activity in the district continues to be weak, again largely because of the strength of the dollar and competitiveness of foreign supply. In Utah, the recent closure of a major copper mining complex was a serious blow to the industry, but was offset in the aggregate by growth elsewhere in the Utah economy. The unemployment rate in Utah actually fell between April and May from 6.5 to 6.2 percent.
