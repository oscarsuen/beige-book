Mixed signals have recently been received from key indicators of the Ninth District economy. While labor market conditions have continued to improve generally, most of the improvement has been seasonal. Some slackening of the pace of consumer spending has been noted throughout the district, although car sales and housing activity rose in some parts. The wood products sector is the only resource-related industry reporting good news, while bad news is still the norm for agriculture.
Low-cost financing deals have propped up car sales into June. Two large domestic manufacturers have been left with low current inventories of trucks and cars. Both manufacturers have experienced year-to-date vehicle sales-especially truck sales-in excess of last year's good results. Sales were off in Montana, though, and also slowed in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
Aided by falling interest rates, housing activity generally has grown. Sales of Minneapolis homes are up a whopping 31 percent this April, compared with last April. A major home builder association reports that its members had a record number of homes in the planning and building stages. Apartment construction has also taken off in the Twin Cities metro area, due to a combination of low interest and vacancy rates as well as to attempts to beat the possible enactment of federal tax laws unfavorable to real estate investment.
Early reports from tourist centers indicate that the pace of tourist spending—an important contributor to the district's economy in summer—is above last year's level in several spots in Minnesota. But tourist spending in North Dakota and Montana has been slowed by the strong U.S. dollar, which has kept Canadian visitors away.
