Most District economic indicators have declined recently. Retailers, however, reported single-digit sales increases in May over year-ago levels. District employment declined slightly in April, though the unemployment rate remained unchanged. Both residential and nonresidential construction contracts declined from the year-ago level in April. District respondents expect very little change in business conditions over the next three months. Total loan growth at large District banks has slowed from last year's pace. Only consumer loan growth has outpaced the year-ago growth rate. In the agricultural sector, the prospect of large harvests has lowered futures prices for most major crops to new life-of-contract lows.
Consistent with recent experience, consumer lending has grown more rapidly over the past 3 months of this year (33 percent) than for the same period last year (12 percent). Over the last three months, however, the month to month growth rates have been declining, suggesting a slowing in consumer borrowing.
