The pace of economic activity in all Districts seems to be slowing across most sectors. Retail sales generally continue to sag yet inventory levels appear satisfactory and the outlook remains optimistic. An important exception is auto sales which are strong in most areas and the strength is extending to suppliers. While primary metals manufacturing is improving in some areas, manufacturing growth in general seems to be modest or declining. Residential construction is a source of strength throughout the country, but signs of weakness exist in parts of some districts. Non-residential construction is mixed. Agricultural conditions remain difficult almost everywhere, but financial problems appear concentrated in the Plains states. Mining and drilling activity is declining throughout the country. Bank loan activity is mixed with most growth occurring in the consumer sector.
The outlook for consumer spending was generally optimistic across the country; lower interest rates and increased mailings of tax refunds were commonly expected to boost demand. Only Dallas mentioned expectations of further slowing.
Business for primary metals producers was mixed. Continued distress for steelmakers was reported in the Cleveland district and in the Chicago area. Minneapolis noted that iron ore processing cutbacks are soon expected. However, steel and other metals producers report gains in the Dallas District as well as in New York. Alabama, and the Detroit area.
Two districts report slowing in high-tech industries, Boston and San Francisco both report weakness among semiconductor firms (with signs of recovery only in Arizona), attributed to weak domestic demand. Business for New England computer manufacturers was mixed. Suppliers to the auto industry have benefitted from that industry's strength, according to reports from Boston and Chicago. Energy-related producers in three districts report slack demand.
Then were several reports of hardship caused by import competition and the strong dollar. Reports of adverse impacts come from steelmakers (Cleveland), manufacturers of home appliances and capital equipment (Chicago), paper producers (Atlanta and Dallas), the lumber industry (San Francisco), and apparel and textiles firms (Richmond and Atlanta).
Most natural resource industries seem to be hard hit. Dallas notes a continued slide in the number of drilling rigs, primarily due to declining petroleum prices. Richmond and San Francisco report employment declines in mining. Minneapolis contacts, however, observe a boom in the wood products industry as a result of strong construction activity. Forest fires in the Sixth District have created tremendous, and largely uninsured, timber losses.
Financial pressures in agriculture seen to remain concentrated in the Plains states. Kansas City reports that agricultural bank closings have shut many farmers out of the credit markets due in part to higher credit standards of the remaining banks. Chicago adds that pressures seem to be increasing on the cooperative Farm Credit System.
