Two distinct pictures emerge from the District economy at this time. Most areas and sectors are offering very upbeat reports. Activity is generally rising, and in many cases, from already record or near record levels. Such reports come from the retail sector, the construction and housing sectors, and the service sector. On the other hand, the manufacturing and agricultural sectors are giving off very negative signals. The manufacturing sector, in particular, is reporting declining sales, production, and employment. Manufacturers continue to cite foreign competition as a major factor in the current situation, and quite a few are apparently relying more heavily on offshore production themselves, either by moving production facilities or by importing parts or materials. In agriculture, recent rain has ameliorated difficulties in some areas, but crop outlooks remain less than satisfactory.
Coal production remains slightly below the record levels of last year, but is still quite strong. Mining employment, on the other hand, is not holding up so well. During April coal mining employment in West Virginia was more than 5 percent below the year earlier level.
