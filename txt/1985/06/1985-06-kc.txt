Economic activity in the Tenth District appears to be relatively sluggish. Retail sales are down slightly from a year ago, although auto sales remain comparable to sales a year earlier. Prices remain generally stable, at retail and for manufacturers' inputs. Housing starts are also off from a year ago, though sales of new homes are generally up. Future mortgage demand is expected to be stronger, as rates are expected to decline further. Agricultural lenders and borrowers in the district are both facing continuing difficulties. A good winter wheat harvest is well under way in Tenth District states. Bank loan demand is flat while deposits are generally higher.
Nebraska and Colorado have been especially hard hit by agricultural bank closings this year. In both states, farm borrowers at closed banks are having difficulty finding alternative sources of credit. Agricultural lenders in these states report that successor banks have applied higher credit standards, and other banks generally are not picking up customers of failed banks. As many as half of these customers may be unable to find new sources of credit.
The wheat crop in the Tenth District is expected to be very good. Until interrupted by recent rains, the harvest in Oklahoma and southern Kansas was running a week to ten days ahead of schedule, and is 95 percent complete in southwest Oklahoma.
Spring planting of corn, soybeans, and sorghum in the Tenth District is generally on schedule, and in some cases well ahead of the usual date. Successful spring planting has produced optimism about crop production prospects for the 1985 season, with crop conditions overall reported as good to excellent.
