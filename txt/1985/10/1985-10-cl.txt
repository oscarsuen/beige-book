Auto dealers report that, as expected, sales fell during the first week of October as special financing on 1985 models ended. However, this decline was not as severe as many had expected and sales are described as "typical" for October. Expectations for the rest of 1985 are mixed, with some dealers building inventories in anticipation of strong sales through November, while others expect an immediate sharp decline in demand. Several dealers express confidence that major manufacturers are likely to re-establish low financing rates on virtually all models soon because bank loan rates for car purchases are far above the banks' cost of funds and these spreads are unlikely to diminish much in the near term.
Purchasing managers generally report slight declines in prices paid for materials and components and in prices received for finished goods, and describe the current situation as a buyers' market. They expect no increase in inflation in the next six months.
