Economic activity in the Tenth District is improving somewhat, apart from the weak farm sector. Retail sales are growing, with new car sales especially strong. Prices at retail and for factory inputs are generally stable. Inventories of industrial materials and retail goods are generally viewed as satisfactory. Residential construction activity varies widely across the district. Inflows to thrifts are increasing, with mortgage demand mixed to slightly higher. Loan demand at commercial banks is off slightly and deposits have increased slightly.
Most savings and loan associations report a significant increase in savings inflows relative to last year. Several institutions reporting strong inflows also report aggressive campaigns to attract funds. Each respondent expects the current trend to continue. Respondents also report mixed to slightly higher mortgage demand and commitments. Somewhat lower demand is expected as winter approaches. Mortgage rates are constant and are expected to remain so. Most institutions have not reduced to $1000 their minimum deposit on money market deposit accounts, Super NOW accounts, and 7-31 day certificates of deposit. Those that have reduced their minimum deposit believe that deposits have grown as a result.
Fall grain harvest is underway in the district following a good wheat harvest. District farmers expect excellent corn, milo, and soybean yields. Nearly all farmers who are eligible are choosing to store their grain under Commodity Credit Corporation loans. In some areas, however, the number of farmers selling grain on the cash market is up somewhat from last fall. Though not a preferred option because of depressed grain prices, some farmers are pressed for cash to pay outstanding loans.
Winter wheat is being seeded in the district, though planting is behind in some areas due to wet weather. In general, district wheat growers are not having serious problems obtaining credit, although conditions are somewhat tighter than a year ago. A higher percentage of growers in Oklahoma and Missouri are having problems than in other district states. In most cases, input suppliers are unwilling to provide inputs on credit.
