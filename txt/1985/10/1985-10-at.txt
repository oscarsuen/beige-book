Broadly-based yardsticks of economic activity indicate a mixed performance of the Southeast economy in late summer. Employment growth exceeded labor force growth, reducing the region's jobless rate. Manufacturing employment showed a respectable increase in August, with transportation equipment responsible for much of the growth. Consumer spending is up from a year ago. However, September retail sales were up only moderately from August as consumers gave a lukewarm response to sales promotions. Construction of single-family housing is strong but signs of weakness have surfaced in multifamily, commercial and office construction. The pace of loan demand is slackening despite an uptick in business loans in September. Tourism has flattened somewhat around the region. Whilecarpet mills are increasing employment, owing to strong demand and low susceptibility to imports, weakness persists in other textiles and apparel, petrochemicals, and agriculture.
