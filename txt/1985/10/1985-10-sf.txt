In most of the District, auto sales have been very strong. Oregon, however, posted a decline in August which more than offset July's sales increases. Many are concerned that sales will drop sharply when incentive financing stops.
Activity in the forest products industries remains stagnant. U.S. producers complain that their competitiveness is compromised by subsidized Canadian production, as well as cultural and legal restrictions on sales to Japan. Although some Oregon firms recently posted profits and are optimistic about the future, many others remain depressed. Further mill shutdowns are contemplated, and for the first time the paper market shows signs of weakness.
Disappointment is evident in regions that had counted on the semiconductor and electronics industries to lead employment growth. Additional layoffs, short work weeks, and salary cuts are announced frequently.
Defense and aerospace production continue to provide employment growth throughout the Twelfth District, with California and Washington benefiting most from these sectors.
Multifamily and nonresidential construction exhibited greater variation. Continued commercial construction activity is exacerbating already saturated markets in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas, while vacancy rates appear to be falling in California's San Joaquin Valley. Multifamily residential construction is falling sharply in Utah and Arizona due to the past overbuilding that has increased vacancies in those markets. Previously torrid multifamily activity in the San Diego area appears to be slowing somewhat, while in Portland, multifamily permits rose substantially in August.
Demand for consumer credit continues strong and a bank study in Utah found that consumer debt relative to income is still only 77 percent of its 1977 peak. However, September delinquency rates on consumer loans and credit card purchases remain much higher than a year ago.
Mortgage rates remain essentially the same as last month, with some banks offering 30-year fixed rate mortgages at rates just above 12 percent. An Idaho bank reports that through the first eight months of 1985 its total new mortgage loan originations were 24 percent higher than the same period in 1984.
