Although some layoffs and plant closings continued, there was a significant increase in announcements of new development projects and expansions. An automobile producer will spend over $100 million to refurbish and retool a stamping plant in Buffalo. Another auto plant is recalling its night shift of 2,200 workers in Tarrytown. Also planned are a large computer center in Rockland County, a new chemical facility in Western New York, a power plant near Albany, and the expansion of a ship terminal on Staten Island.
In the aggregate, however, manufacturing remains a weak spot even with record high employment levels in New York State. The largest plant closing announced recently was a Syracuse chemical plant, which will eliminate 1,400 jobs beginning early next year.
The housing market was little changed from activity levels prevailing for the past year. Builders remained very busy in many parts of the District and several faced scarcity of skilled labor or lumber and sheetrock. The outlook for the next six months is for continued strength. In New York City, the first 800 apartments to be built with funds from the State's Municipal Assistance Corporation have been scheduled for construction this summer.
