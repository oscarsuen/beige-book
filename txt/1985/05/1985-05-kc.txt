Spring calving results are reported as good to excellent in Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, and Wyoming, but only average in Kansas and Oklahoma. In Nebraska and parts of Wyoming, stocker cattle have mowed into feedlots. However, in other Tenth District states stocker cattle are still being held in anticipation of higher prices.
Rates of farm liquidation vary among Tenth District states, but are generally lower than recent publicity night indicate. Liquidations of farm businesses are three to five tines as high as bankers consider normal, however, with partial liquidations five to six times as high. District agricultural lenders expect these liquidation rates to remain high for at least several months. Despite current farm financial difficulties, few farm borrowers did not receive credit for spring planting. Banks in New Mexico and Wyoming report less than 2 percent of their borrowers did not receive credit. Percentages are somewhat higher in other district states, ranging from 3 percent in Kansas and parts of Nebraska to 12 percent in Missouri.
