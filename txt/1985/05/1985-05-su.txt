The pace of economic activity in moat Federal Reserve districts appears to reflect the slower first-quarter rate of national economic growth. Retail sales generally are showing modest growth through early spring, while strength in auto sales is continuing. Retail inventories are viewed as generally satisfactory. Residential construction activity remains strong and the short-term outlook is optimistic. Commercial construction appears to be thriving in most areas. Indicators of manufacturing activity, however, are mixed. Due partly to international trade effects, the performance of many industries is weak, although steel production is increasing as is the demand for machine tools. Conditions remain depressed in the agricultural sector where downward pressures on prices, a tight cash flow situation, and increasing financial stress are pervasive. Reports on bank loan demand are mixed, both across the country and within individual districts.
Foreign trade effects continue to be very important. Atlanta reports that import competition is still adversely affecting its district industries. While growth of textile and apparel imports has recently slackened, increased imports of refined petroleum products are hurting Louisiana's petrochemical industries. Minneapolis notes that Ninth District pulp producers are being hurt by low foreign pulp prices. San Francisco reports that, due partly to vigorous foreign competition, forest products industries and primary metals industries are still the weakest sectors in the district, with a number of plant closings occurring in each industry. On the other hand, Richmond notes that coal production is off to a good start in 1985, partly due to increased exports of metallurgical coal. And exports of southern pine to Europe are on the increase, according to the Atlanta report.
Steel production is rising, but remains below early-1984 levels. The stronger demand is centered in cold-rolled and coated sheets, primarily for motor vehicles, appliances, and light construction. Cleveland notes that the steel industry remains in difficulty, however. Both Chicago and Cleveland report growing demand for machine tools, but orders are still below past levels. Cleveland also states that "major producers of capital goods believe spending on plant and equipment is not likely to be slower in the second half than in the first half of 1985, despite the results of the recent survey of spending plans."
Commercial construction appears to be thriving in most areas, including both Philadelphia (where vacancy rates are below the national average) and Chicago (where the vacancy rate is described as "substantial"). Atlanta cautions about potential oversupply, however, and Dallas reports a first- quarter decline in nonresidential activity as evidence of oversupply there becomes more apparent.
