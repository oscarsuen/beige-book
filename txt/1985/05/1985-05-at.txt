Through late April, the southeastern economy pushed ahead, although somewhat unevenly. Florida and Georgia labor markets are generally tight, while those in Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee exhibit considerable slack. Foreign competition continues to pressure employment and industrial output, particularly in the textile, apparel, agriculture, and energy sectors. Consumer spending and installment lending advanced in lackluster fashion, although auto sales have improved since earlier this year. Southeastern construction, real estate, tourism, and convention industries all are having a good spring. In Louisiana, a soaring mortgage delinquency rate, slowing new automobile registrations, and increasing imports of refined petroleum products join the list of difficulties facing that state's beleaguered economy.
