While overall employment and consumer spending have recently increased in the Ninth District, agricultural and resource-related weaknesses have continued. Some signs of slower manufacturing growth are also evident.
Recent labor developments have been mixed. Layoffs at a conglomerate with plants in the Twin Cities and Sioux Falls, South Dakota, continued. As a result, the latter area's unemployment rate rose measurably. The end of large construction projects decreased employment in parts of North Dakota. But a large copper mining operation in the hard-pressed Upper Peninsula of Michigan is very likely to reopen. By employing around 1,000 workers, it would provide a huge stimulus to this small area.
A similar story is told for auto sales which have continued strong in diversified metro areas but have been generally weak in rural areas. Domestic manufacturers report that their sales, when compared to 1984, increased 9 percent through April. Slack demand in nonmetro areas has bogged down truck sales somewhat, though.
Housing activity is also still slack in rural areas, but sales of homes in the Twin Cities have improved. Sales in both Minneapolis and St. Paul have been well above 1984 levels--by more than 12 percent this February, for example. A Minnesota mortgage revenue bond program is expected to buoy sales further. Several Bank Directors note, however, that large inventories of unsold homes are still standing in other areas of the district.
One large firm in Minnesota's paper industry is experiencing labor contract problems. Low foreign pulp prices are hurting district pulp producers. While waferboard plants are running at full speed, prices are depressed.
Due to soft prices and some business climate problems, oil and gas activities have slowed. In Montana, both the oil rig count and leased acreage renewals have dropped-the latter, dramatically. Oil drilling is off in North Dakota, too. Low prices there are also depressing the outlook for a big coal gasification operation.
