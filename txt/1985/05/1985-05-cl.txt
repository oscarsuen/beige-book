Car dealers report slightly lower sales, but expect this to be only a temporary lull in the strong trend of auto sales. They have been moving cars at minimal mark-ups and assert that high sales volume is a key factor in allowing them to price competitively. Dealers voice concern that factories cannot keep up with their demand for some popular smaller models and worry that this problem will grow as sales pick up again. Otherwise, most dealers are pleased with their inventory positions and plan to increase stocks over the next few weeks. All dealers remain confident that consumers will continue to assume debt to acquire new cars.
Machine-tool producers in the District report that demand for machine tools is growing in the aerospace, defense, automotive, and power-generating equipment industries but remains weak in agriculture and construction machinery industries. A major producer of machine tools expects rising sales in the second half of 1985. Despite this growth, orders are weak relative to the previous peak and the firm estimates that 40% to 50% of metal-cutting machinery is now imported.
The steel industry remains in difficulty. One District firm has narrowly averted bankruptcy proceedings, and reports losing money on its carbon steel operations despite operating its mill at 90% of capacity. Another has filed for protection under Chapter 11, and another recently laid off about 350 workers.
Major producers of capital goods believe spending on plant and equipment is not likely to be slower in the second half than the first half of 1985, despite the results of the recent survey of spending plans. Analysts in this District attribute the first quarter softness in PDE spending on computers to be a result of IBM's introduction of two new models, weakness in sales of personal computers, and a reaction to excessive levels of purchases in 1983 and 1984. They expect a pickup in computer purchases this quarter.
A nationwide realty firm reports that listings and closings for existing homes in the first quarter matched last year' s record-breaking first quarter pace, and in April exceeded March's higher-than-expected level.
Builders remain extremely cautious, as orders were down 10% to 15% in the first quarter. They have indicated that for the most part they will build only those houses for which they have firm orders.
Fixed rate mortgages will remain popular with borrowers unless fixed rates rise substantially. Because of high rates of mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, mortgage insurers recently raised down-payment requirements slightly and also raised premiums on insurance renewals. According to the experience of one lender, neither of these actions has materially affected customer ability to buy.
