Major sectors of the Third District economy are stable or growing in April. Manufacturing activity is holding steady after three months of accelerating growth, while retail sales remain strong after a successful Easter selling season. Loan demand is up at area banks. Sales of new and existing houses are rising, and both residential and commercial construction are increasing.
The outlook for the Third District economy is positive. Manufacturers expect to boost production and employment during the next six months, and retailers forecast higher sales for the second half of 1985 and for the year as a whole. Likewise, area bankers anticipate greater loan demand as economic growth continues. Real estate sales and construction activity are expected to remain strong through the summer.
Despite the lack of growth in April, the outlook for local manufacturing over the next six months remains fairly positive. Half of the companies participating in the April survey expect Increases in production, new orders, and shipments during the summer. A quarter of those polled plan to hire more workers, and almost one-fifth expect to lengthen the workweek. About 30 percent have scheduled larger expenditures on new plant and equipment during the next six months.
Prices of industrial goods remained flat again in April. Although some survey respondents reported higher prices for their inputs, more than 80 percent of the survey respondents said there had been no change in the prices of the products they buy or sell. Looking ahead, two out of three of the respondents anticipate paying more for raw materials within the next six months, and one out of three expect the prices of their own products to go up during the same period.
Retailers are cautiously optimistic about the upcoming spring and summer seasons. Apparel and seasonal goods are selling well, and sales are expected to continue strong through the spring. Sale growth is expected to moderate in late summer and fall. For the year as a whole compared to 1984, retailers forecast increases ranging from 6 to 10 percent.
For Third District bankers, a strong economy and concomitant loan demand imply that short-term interest rates are at or near their lows for the year. Local bank economists believe a slight dip is possible in the prime and federal funds rates before a gradual rise during the balance of the year. The consensus is that rates will be higher by the fall, with the prime rate approaching 12 percent and the federal funds rate hovering around 10 percent by the end of the year.
For most areas of the Third District, real estate and construction activity is at or above 1984 levels. Some differences in local growth rates are noted, with those that dipped in 1984 now posting the biggest gains.
Commercial construction continues to thrive. Building agents say the local office vacancy rate remains below the national average and that the market should continue to absorb new space through the rest of the year.
