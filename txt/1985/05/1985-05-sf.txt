The forest products industry in the Pacific Northwest and the primary metals industries elsewhere in the District continue to be the weakest sectors. There continue to be mill closures in the Pacific Northwest and the industry is undergoing a major restructuring. This restructuring may ultimately involve wage cuts of as such as 20 to 25 percent in this highly unionized industry. In the mining industry, there have been several major mine and smelter closures in recent days. The impact of these events on Utah's copper industry alone is estimated to represent 6 to 7 thousand lost jobs. In both industries, the strong dollar and vigorous foreign competition have contributed to continued deterioration.
Agriculture, although still weakened by soft product prices and poor export opportunities, does not appear to be weakening further. The western agricultural economy appears to be more diversified and resilient than elsewhere. In California's Central Valley, for example, the unemployment rate in February fell to 12.7 percent, down from 14.6 percent in the same month in 1984. Retails sales activity in the Central Valley—dependent upon the health of the primary agricultural sector—also have been recovering in recent months.
