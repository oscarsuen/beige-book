The Tenth District economy improved somewhat in June and early July.  Retail sales rose slightly, manufacturing activity increased, and the pace of layoff announcements continued to ease.  In addition, housing and energy activity remained strong.  Commercial real estate markets, on the other hand, were still weak.  In the farm economy, abundant spring rains eased drought conditions in much of the district.  Most prices held steady, and wage increases remained minimal.
