Business contacts in the First District are somewhat more upbeat currently (mid-July) than in the last round of information-gathering (end of May).  Retailers report demand growth for a range of housing-related products, while other merchandise and tourism remain soft.  Manufacturers' results are also mixed, but they note improvements in some sectors.  While slowing from record highs, residential real estate markets remain strong.
The majority of retailers are holding employment levels steady, although two contacts report recent layoffs.  Wage rates are mostly level among contacted firms, with one company freezing a 2 percent merit increase.  Selling prices are mixed, with about half reporting decreases and the remaining half holding prices steady.  Most contacts report no change in capital spending plans, but one firm is cutting spending.
Retailers anticipate slow to moderate improvements in sales in the next six months.  Most contacts feel slightly more optimistic about the outlook for the economy than last time we contacted them and sense that the marketplace is more stable than in recent months.
Most selling prices remain flat to down.  Materials costs generally remain under control, but energy and health care costs are rising, and some firms are concerned that the depreciation of the dollar will result in higher costs for foreign purchases.
Manufacturers of health- and medical-related products are hiring, but most other respondents continue to trim their headcounts.  Contacts indicate that the need to cut overhead costs is leading them to seek out locations with lower-cost or more efficient labor, introduce labor-saving technologies, or consider opportunities for consolidation and outsourcing.  Most companies reporting increases in capital spending say they are motivated by the need to reduce operating costs.  Some contacts indicate that they are reducing overall capital spending because of weak revenue growth or cash flow pressures.
Most manufacturers expect their business to show muted growth in the next six to twelve months.  While they are generally hopeful, they remain cautious because of signs that the overall economy or particular segments remain sluggish.
Higher prices continue to drive double-digit revenue growth rates in the property and casualty sector, even though the pace of increases began moderating in the second quarter.  Despite several cases of uncollectable receivables and a few modest credit losses, companies in this sector continue to expect gradual improvement in their bottom lines.  Results in traditional life insurance are less strong, as some companies are hitting the minimum interest rate floors required for some life and annuity products.
Employment among insurance contacts remains largely static, with stronger-performing firms adding modestly while others implement workforce reductions.  Some companies have delayed a few capital spending projects; others continue to spend on new IT equipment and infrastructure.
