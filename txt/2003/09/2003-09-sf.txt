Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicated a modest increase in overall economic activity in late July and August, representing an improvement in the pace of growth.  With the notable exceptions of health care services and energy, contacts noted little upward pressure on prices and wages.  Retailers reported that sales were generally up and that discounting was less pervasive than in past survey periods.  The District's software services, travel, and tourism sectors saw improvements.  Reports indicated that manufacturing activity continued to rise; orders strengthened for manufacturers of semiconductors, machine tools, and basic metals.  Conditions for District agricultural and resource-related businesses remained solid.  Respondents indicated that demand for homes continued to be strong, while commercial real estate generally remained in the doldrums.  Banking contacts reported some slight improvements in commercial loan originations, particularly among small businesses, and a sharp decline in mortgage refinancing in response to the rise in long-term interest rates.
Demand for several other District services strengthened a bit.  Of note, contacts indicated that demand for both air and water transportation services trended up.  Additionally, new orders for some software and media services increased slightly, with the exception of enterprise software where business is still very slow.  District service providers reported a slight increase in demand for both part-time and full-time employees in IT services.  On the downside, telecommunications service providers continued to be plagued by soft sales and excess capacity.  About an equal number of District retailers and service providers planned to either increase or leave capital spending unchanged, while only a small number expect capital spending to decrease in the near term.
Reports indicated that conditions in the District's travel and tourism sectors improved slightly in late July and August.  In Hawaii, increases in domestic visitor counts largely offset declines by international visitors.  Hotel occupancy rates inched up in Hawaii, California, and other areas.  However, the restaurant industry continued to face below-normal demand in some markets.
On the commercial side, high vacancy rates continued to characterize many District markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area and Las Vegas.  Contacts reported very little commercial construction activity outside of Hawaii and Southern California.
