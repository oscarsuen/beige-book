Most Fourth District contacts reported increased                   economic activity since the last report, although growth appears                   to be modest. For the third consecutive report, manufacturers                   cited steady or improving production and sales. Residential                   homebuilders reported continued sales growth. Demand for commercial                   loans increased since the last report, while consumer loans                   remained constant.
Reports from other areas of the economy were mixed. Retailers                   and auto dealers experienced continued slow sales, though these                   were not necessarily unanticipated. Activity in commercial construction                   accelerated in parts of the District, but it remained sluggish                   in others. After a more optimistic report in July, conditions                   in steel did not show further improvement. Though overall prices                   of inputs were flat or declining, utility prices rose. Employment                   levels did not change for most contacts; some added employees,                   and a few firms reported layoffs. While there is plenty available                   labor, contacts stated there is less available now than during                   the same time last year. Rising insurance costs have caused                   a number of firms to change features in benefits offered to                   employees, both by passing some costs to employees and curtailing                   some benefits.
Most contacts in manufacturing, residential construction,                   banking, and trucking and shipping expect conditions to continue                   improving throughout the rest of the year, while contacts in                   steel, commercial construction, and retail were more mixed with                   regard to continued activity.
This District was affected by the blackout in                   mid-August. Though most contacts could not immediately discern                   the total impact, retail and manufacturing experienced the greatest                   impact as a result of closures. Other sectors of the economy                   experienced minor or no problems due to the electricity problems.
Auto production fell again at most District plants                   in July and early August compared with June, but it should be                   noted that many facilities re-tooled in early July. Regardless,                   same-model production was about 4 percent lower than 2002 levels.                   In July, three new models began production in the District.                   A few facilities reported the use of overtime.
In the steel industry, production was fairly stable between July                   and August, though there was some mention of increased sales                   between July and August. However, overall demand was characterized                   as "soft" in August, and both sales and production levels during                   this period were substantially down from last year. Inventories                   are down from a year ago, and firms anticipate holding inventories                   at their current low level. New orders for steel for the fall                   are coming at a steady rate, and contacts expect the demand                   to remain the same till the end of the year. To meet current                   demand, plants are running normal-to-shortened work schedules.                   Most contacts have held employment levels constant since the                   previous report although a few are reducing jobs. Steel prices                   were mixed, with slight movement in both directions.
Many manufacturers in the areas affected by the                   blackout were closed up to three days; however, most firms stated                   that they were able to tap into inventories and anticipated                   being able to use overtime production, as needed, to make up                   for the loss. Manufacturing contacts stated that supply chains                   were largely uninterrupted and orders were unaffected.
Retailers in the District reported electricity-related                   losses on Thursday, though many were able to open on Friday.                   Overall impact on the sector is not yet known. Restaurants were                   particularly hard hit because of the water problems that continued                   after electricity was restored.
Automobile dealers noted flat-to-declining new car sales throughout                   the District. Overall sales this period were lower than during                   the same time last year. Sales continue to be dependent on incentives,                   though their impact on consumers has deteriorated. Used car                   sales, on the other hand, continued to increase. New car inventory                   levels are more favorable than in previous months.
Commercial building continues to be slow, though parts of the                   District show signs of improvement. Within the last several                   weeks in the Cleveland area, the number of new projects in several                   building segments, including manufacturing, warehousing, and                   distribution had accelerated. There also appears to be increased                   activity in the Pittsburgh area, while in the Columbus area                   and the southern part of the District demand remained sluggish.
During the blackout, many banks lost ATMs and                   some branches closed, though it was toward the end of the business                   day, and most areas had power restored by the following morning                   for business.
