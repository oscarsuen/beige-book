The Second District's economy has given mostly                 positive signals since the last report. The mid-August power outage                 evidently had a minimal effect on overall economic activity-some                 impact was reported on retailers and contract employers. Retail                 sales, which were above plan in July, were close to plan, on balance,                 in the first three weeks of August; inventories were generally                 reported to be at desired levels. Manufacturing activity continued                 to improve in July and early August, and there was a noticeable                 pickup in port traffic.
Housing markets have continued to show strength,                 although some contacts view brisk summer activity as an artifact                 of rising mortgage rates. New York City's office market continued                 to improve in July, with particular strength in the Class B segment,                 and city hotels report increased business. Finally, bankers in                 the district report stable loan demand, little change in credit                 standards, and increased delinquency rates on commercial loans                 but decreased rates on home mortgages.
Manhattan hotels report that business was fairly                 strong in July and early August: while room rates were down about                 3 percent from a year earlier, occupancies were up nearly 5 percent.                 As a result, total revenues were up, on a year-over-year basis,                 for the first time this year. While two major New York City hotels                 had to evacuate during the blackout, most were fully occupied-some                 offered discounts and even free rooms.
Manhattan's office market showed continued improvement                 in July, led by strong leasing activity in the Class B segment,                 largely from small to medium-sized firms. Overall, vacancy rates                 declined moderately in Midtown and Midtown South; Lower Manhattan's                 rate inched up but is still substantially lower than at the end                 of the first quarter. Asking rents appear to have leveled off                 this year but are still roughly 8 percent lower than a year ago.
The manufacturing sector has shown continued positive                 momentum in July and early August. Our monthly survey of New York                 State manufacturers shows continued improvement in conditions                 in early August. Buffalo-area purchasers report a strong snapback                 in manufacturing-sector conditions in July, following a brief                 slowdown in June. Similarly, Rochester purchasers report improved                 business conditions in both manufacturing and other sectors. Finally,                 New York City area purchasing managers report continued improvement                 in the manufacturing sector in July; there was some leveling off                 outside of manufacturing, where New York City respondents had                 been reporting weakening throughout the first half of the year.                 Purchasing managers in all three metropolitan areas report an                 upturn in input prices.
A major freight shipping terminal reports a noticeable                 increase in volume (mostly imports from Asia) since the beginning                 of August; total volume is reported to be up roughly 10 to 13                 percent from a year earlier, and largely represents holiday-season                 retail merchandise. Part of the pickup reflects a trend toward                 more "all-water" services to the East Coast ports from Asia, and                 is spurring increased warehousing and distribution in New Jersey.                 The power outage at the port lasted less than four hours and had                 a minimal effect.
Interest rates rose for all types of loans-in particular                 more than three in four bankers report higher rates for residential                 mortgages, and more than half report an increase in rates for                 commercial mortgages. However, average deposit rates declined,                 with over half of bankers reporting lower rates, as opposed to                 one in six reporting higher rates. Bankers report that delinquency                 rates increased for commercial and industrial loans but decreased                 for residential mortgages.
