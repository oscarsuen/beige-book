Reports from Sixth District contacts pointed toward a modest improvement in economic activity from late July through mid-August.  Retail contacts were positive about sales activity and the manufacturing sector displayed some welcome signs of improvement. The pace of factory orders was reported to have increased in some industries, and transportation contacts noted an increase in shipping activity.  Despite the recent run up in mortgage rates, single-family construction and sales remained flat to slightly up.  Commercial construction was still limited by low demand for new space.  Nonetheless, office leasing activity and net absorption conditions continued to improve in most markets.  The District's tourism and business travel sectors continued to lag, and higher gasoline prices in August were expected to further dampen travel.  The healthcare and education sectors continued to report increased demand for workers, whereas the pace of the layoffs in the manufacturing sector slowed from earlier in the year.  The strongest employment reports came from Georgia and Florida.
