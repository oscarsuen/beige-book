Business activity in the Third District continued                   to advance slowly in August. Manufacturers reported increases                   in orders and shipments for the month. Retail sales of general                   merchandise picked up in August for the usual back-to-school                   shopping period, although the year-over-year gain appeared to                   be slight. Auto and light truck sales have been strong as model                   year close-out promotions boosted the sales rate. Bank lending                   has been rising slowly, with most of the gain coming from residential                   lending. Commercial real estate markets remain soft, but home                   sales have increased. Overall tourism business for the summer                   season appears to be matching last year's level, but lodging                   activity is off from last summer.
The outlook among contacts in the Third District                   business community is for steady or slowly improving conditions.                   Manufacturers forecast increases in shipments and orders during                   the next six months. Most of the retailers surveyed in August                   expect sales to rise slowly through the fall. Auto dealers anticipate                   some slippage in sales after 2003 models are cleared out. Bankers                   expect slow growth in lending as the pace of economic activity                   in the region gradually rises.
The outlook among the region's manufacturers                   is positive. Around half expect increases in shipments and orders                   during the next six months, and less than one in five anticipate                   decreases. Area manufacturers forecast some increases in employment                   and working hours, on balance, in the next six months, and they                   plan to step up capital spending plans moderately.
The consensus among retailers contacted in August                   is that sales will move up slowly during the fall. Several store                   executives said they will introduce cold-weather merchandise                   later than usual this year and keep inventories limited. These                   retailers said consumers have been showing a greater tendency                   to delay purchases until their needs are more immediate. Merchants                   are responding by timing the introduction of seasonal merchandise                   more closely to the relevant season.
Auto dealers reported generally rising sales                   during August. Manufacturers boosted incentives to clear out                   2003 models as 2004 models arrive. Dealers are taking delivery                   of new models, and consequently, their inventories are high.                   In general, dealers expect it will be difficult to maintain                   the current rate of sales once older model inventories are depleted,                   but most dealers anticipate a high sales rate for the most popular                   new domestic cars and trucks and continued strong sales of luxury                   imports.
Bankers surveyed in August expect business activity                   in the region to move up very gradually, and they expect total                   lending to rise slowly along with the improvement in regional                   economic conditions. Some also said they expect at least a slight                   deterioration in credit quality, unless the recovery in the                   region's economy strengthens.
Residential real estate agents and home builders generally reported                   that sales have accelerated. They said the recent upturn in                   mortgage interest rates prompted a rush to complete sales of                   both new and existing homes. Home builders generally expect                   sales to remain strong, although some indicated that their backlogs                   appear to have peaked. Real estate agents expect a strengthening                   economy to support a fairly good rate of home sales despite                   higher mortgage rates.
