Conversations with First District business contacts                   again have a positive tone. Retailers say sales were up modestly                   during the summer months, and manufacturers report second quarter                   demand improvements in selected areas. Temp firms and software                   and IT companies also see some pickup. Commercial real estate                   markets are said to be stabilizing. Contacts in all sectors                   indicate that they remain cautious.
Most contacts report employment is steady, though                   two retailers expect their headcount to increase by at least                   100 over the course of the year. Some respondents recently implemented                   annual salary increases, ranging from 2.5 to 3 percent, while                   the majority report no changes. Vendor prices are mostly stable,                   with selling prices flat to down. Capital spending plans are                   mixed among contacted retailers, with about half holding spending                   steady. New store openings account for most increases, while                   decreases reflect computer-related cutbacks.
Looking forward, most surveyed retailers anticipate                   slow sales growth over the next six months. Most contacts express                   greater optimism about the future of the economy than in the                   recent past. However, some retailers note concern about high                   unemployment rates, the possibility of rising interest rates,                   and the continued threat of terrorism.
Manufacturers also report that retailers and                   other major customers continue to demand price concessions although                   a few contacts have achieved small increases in selected prices.                   Downward price pressures reflect manufacturers' excess capacity                   and customers' increased use of online bidding. With prices                   for materials, other than petrochemicals, also flat to down                   year-over-year, respondents plan to improve margins through                   ongoing efforts to cut production costs.
Labor demand appears to be stabilizing at surveyed                   manufacturers. A majority reduced employment in recent months,                   but most hope to avoid further layoffs. A few have increased                   overtime or are hiring for specific divisions. One noted that                   experienced engineers are scarce.
A few firms are increasing their capital spending                   markedly in 2003 from 2002 levels as they "chase" technology                   or install long planned lean manufacturing systems. But over                   half are spending "carefully"--below last year, below budget                   or below norm. Most point to idle capacity.
A majority of contacts express cautious optimism                   about future prospects, with several noting that the outlook                   for profits or sales is better than expected recently and may                   even be improving. However, most view the improvements to date                   as modest and the challenges as daunting. Thus, they continue                   to plan conservatively and to hunt aggressively for savings.
Several staffing companies report that some applicants                   have received multiple job offers, which respondents interpret                   as a sign of demand growth. Some contacts report a decline in                   labor supply, both skilled and unskilled. However, the number                   of permanent positions available remains small, with clients                   still preferring to hire on a temporary basis. Downward price                   pressure continues, with some companies reducing both bill rates                   and wages in response. Most respondents express concern about                   rising costs, particularly for medical and worker's compensation                   insurance.
Contacts are positive about the remainder of                   2003, anticipating modest demand growth during this period.                   But after a healthy July and August, some respondents say they                   will wait to see what September has in store before committing                   to the idea of an economic recovery.
A few companies that were struggling to avoid                   layoffs in the first quarter are now beginning to hire; however,                   one contact reports a 10 percent layoff. Capital spending across                   the sector is still uneven, with some companies spending substantial                   amounts on technology and others freezing expenditures until                   the end of the year.
The outlook is beginning to change from flat                   to positive in the near term as contacts throughout the software                   and IT sector are buoyed by recent inquiries. Respondents report                   increased interest in custom applications and banking software.
