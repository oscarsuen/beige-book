Consistent with solid consumer spending, the District's travel and tourism sector experienced a pickup in demand.  Early snows and cold conditions in ski areas pushed up the start of the winter travel season in many parts of the District.  In Hawaii, domestic visitor counts continued to grow.  International visitor counts remain soft, but respondents expect the weaker dollar to boost international traffic in coming months; a weaker dollar already is credited for increased daily spending among recent international visitors.  Hotel occupancy rates climbed and reservation bookings at restaurants grew in several District markets.
Providers of several business services also noted improved conditions.  Contacts in advertising and software production reported a pickup in demand for their services, albeit from low levels.  Demand for professional services, such as accounting, securities, and legal services stabilized, following months of contraction.   The healthcare services sector continued to expand in many areas of the District.
On the commercial side, there were scattered signs of improvement, although conditions overall remained weak.  Office markets in Arizona and Nevada reportedly benefited from the movement of some businesses out of California.  In other states including Oregon, Utah, and Washington, businesses began to renew rather than relinquish leases on existing office space.
