October sales were disappointing, according to District auto dealers. Contacts noted that, as inventories of highly promoted 2003 vehicles dwindled, bargain-seeking buyers were hesitant to purchase new model cars and trucks that often carried less generous incentives. However, several dealers were encouraged by recent strong floor traffic.  Reports on used car sales were mixed, with some car dealers continuing to struggle with weak demand and others reporting lower inventory and greater participation at regional auctions.
Prices remained stable, with a few exceptions.  Firms continued to note increasing health care costs; however, one report indicated that the rise in health care costs is likely to slow somewhat next year.  Lower fuel prices aided District transporters.
