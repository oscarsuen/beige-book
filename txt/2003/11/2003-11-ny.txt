The Second District's economy has given generally                   positive signals since the last report, despite some signs of                   slowing in consumer spending. There has been a further pickup                   in hiring activity in a number of sectors. Recent business surveys                   point to further gains in manufacturing activity in recent weeks.                   Consumer confidence rebounded in October, after declining for                   a number of months. On the other hand, most retailers report                   that sales were somewhat below plan in October and early November,                   partly due to weather.
Both residential construction and the market                   for existing homes have remained robust. Manhattan office vacancy                   rates were mixed in October, with some improvement Downtown                   but an uptick in Midtown. Strong profits and revenues in New                   York City's financial industry are reportedly driving up bonuses                   and prompting a pickup in hiring. Finally, bankers report some                   weakening in demand for consumer and especially home-mortgage                   loans, but across-the-board declines in delinquency rates.
Consumer confidence rebounded in October, based on two separate                   surveys. Siena College's monthly survey of New York State residents                   shows confidence jumping to its highest level in more than a                   year, led by the New York City metro area, while the Conference                   Board's confidence index for the Middle Atlantic states (NY,                   NJ, PA) posted a more moderate rebound.
Housing permits rose in the third quarter, with a pickup in the                   single-family segment overshadowing a dip in multifamily permits.                   Still, year-to-date, multifamily permits are running more than                   10 percent ahead of 2002 levels and are on track for the strongest                   annual performance since 1987. More recently, homebuilders in                   northern New Jersey report persistent strength in the market                   through mid-November, with prices continuing to rise, though                   at a more subdued pace than earlier in the year. One industry                   contact reports a noticeable pickup in bridge loans, which is                   attributed to homes taking longer than expected to sell.
Manhattan's office market was mixed in October.                   Data from a major brokerage show Midtown's vacancy rate rising                   from 11 to 11.9 percent, but Lower Manhattan's rate edging down                   from 12.9 to 12.4 percent. However, asking rents, though still                   well below a year earlier, rose in both areas. An industry contact                   notes that Lower Manhattan's market has been helped by soon-to-expire                   tax incentives for new leases.
The manufacturing sector has continued to give                   positive signals in October and early November, even in terms                   of employment. Our latest Empire State Manufacturing Survey,                   conducted in the first half of November, points to further widespread                   improvement in business conditions, increased employment and                   little change in input costs or selling prices. Similarly, New                   York City area purchasing managers report further widespread                   improvement in the manufacturing sector in October, as well                   as a pickup in other sectors. Buffalo-area purchasers also report                   that manufacturing-sector conditions continued to improve in                   October, with accelerating production activity, steady growth                   in new orders and modest increases in employment. On the other                   hand Rochester-area purchasing managers report some softening                   in manufacturing sector conditions. Reports on input prices                   were mixed: some escalation was reported from Buffalo, but declines                   were indicated in Rochester, and little change in the New York                   City area.
On the supply side, almost all respondents report                   that credit standards did not change for any type of lending.                   Interest rates rose for residential and commercial mortgages,                   but did not change for other loan categories. Most bankers also                   indicate that average deposit rates remained constant. Finally,                   delinquency rates decreased noticeably for all categories of                   loans, with roughly five times as many bankers indicating an                   overall decrease as an increase.
