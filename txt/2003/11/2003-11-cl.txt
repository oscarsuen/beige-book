Business conditions for firms in the Fourth District appeared to improve from late September to early November.  While most durable goods manufacturers saw production levels stay steady in recent weeks, automobile and steel producers reported increases in production of late.  Nondurable goods producers continue to report increases in production, and most indicated lower levels of idle capacity than durable goods producers did.
District retailers typically reported monthly increases in sales in September and October.  However, growth rates were uneven, and despite optimism about the outlook, many retailers reported that sales levels in recent weeks were lower than at this time last year.  Residential building remains strong, and while commercial construction is still weak, there are signs of improvement in the sector.  Finally, activity for trucking and shipping firms is said to have increased significantly in the last six weeks.
For the most part, price pressures continue to be muted; however, there were some reports of rising commodity prices, as well as reports of rising steel and energy prices.  A variety of businesses also reported rising labor costs due to increases in health insurance premiums.  Despite an apparent pick-up in economic activity, few contacts indicated any intention to increase staffing levels outside of seasonal additions.
Both nondurable and durable goods producers reported lower inventory levels than at this time a year ago.  A small majority of durable goods producers reported that more than a quarter of their capacity remained idle, but nondurable goods producers mostly reported little if any spare capacity.  The use of overtime was more widespread among nondurable goods producers than among durable goods producers, but permanent staffing levels remained little changed for both types of manufacturers.  Most producers reported that their input prices were flat or had fallen somewhat in the last month, though some noted increases in steel prices.  There were also isolated reports of other increases in commodity prices.  Over the last year, input prices are reported to have risen for nearly all contacts involved in nondurable goods production.
Production for the auto manufacturing facilities that we follow in the District rose significantly from September to October.  Relative to a year ago, total automobile production in the District appears to have risen about 10 percent.  By contrast, national automobile production is reportedly flat from a year ago.
Domestic steel producers reported flat to increasing shipments in recent weeks.  Demand for steel was mixed across various market segments: Shipments to auto producers reportedly remained steady, while demand from commercial builders was sluggish, and demand from defense-related contractors continued to be strong.  A few firms indicated that their rate of capacity utilization rose slightly to accommodate increases in shipment volumes.  Nevertheless, most firms have maintained normal work schedules in recent weeks and do not have plans to increase the size of their workforce.  There were reports of some cost pressures for steel producers, particularly with respect to rising natural gas prices.  Steel prices have reportedly risen in recent weeks, and several producers indicated that they intend to increase prices again in early 2004.
Prices at the vendor and retail levels are reportedly mostly unchanged in recent weeks, while inventories are reported to be flat or down relative to a year ago and continue to be tightly managed.  Contacts noted that it remains easy to find qualified job applicants.
On balance, new car sales in the District were flat; about as many contacts said that sales worsened in October relative to September as said that they improved.  Much of the month-to-month fluctuations appear to be incentive-driven.  Ford and Chrysler recently reduced the rebates they offer, and sales of these makes, according to contacts, have fallen as a result.  Sales of other makes were reported to have been stronger.  Used car sales were said to be steady or slightly improving.
There are indications that commercial construction is improving in some parts of the District, but overall conditions continue to be weak.  Demand for new office space seems particularly weak in downtown Pittsburgh; by contrast, with vacancy rates beginning to decline, office construction activity appears to be increasing slightly in Columbus, Ohio.  Reports from builders whose clients are primarily manufacturers were mixed.  There was little or no change, overall, in input costs.  Staffing levels also remained steady.
