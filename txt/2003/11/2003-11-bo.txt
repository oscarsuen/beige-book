Business contacts in the First                   District report improving conditions at the end of the third                   quarter and early in the fourth quarter. While results are mixed                   from month to month, retailers cite fairly consistent sales                   increases from a year earlier. Contacted manufacturers and software                   firms indicate that demand seems to be improving. While retailers                   and manufacturers mention only scattered employment increases,                   most staffing firms report growing demand for labor. Contacts                   express concern with increases in input prices and other business                   costs such as insurance, while selling prices are generally                   level.
The consensus among contacted                   retailers is that sales will improve moderately in the next                   six months. Several store executives said they expect sales                   this Christmas season to surpass those of last year, while one                   respondent expects the upcoming season to be very "promotional."
Manufacturers report that rising                   demand is leading-or will soon lead-to higher prices for certain                   inputs such as metals, silicone wafers, and hardwoods. Fuel                   surtaxes and plastics costs remain high, and insurance costs                   continue to increase. Equipment manufacturers say that their                   selling prices continue to decline. Paper companies and some                   consumer goods manufacturers are offering discounts in order                   to boost sales. Apart from these cases, other materials costs                   and selling prices are generally flat.
Most of the contacted manufacturers                   expect to hold domestic employment fairly flat in coming months,                   although some are adding engineers and temporary factory help.                   Base pay increases for 2004 are projected to be 2.5 to 4 percent.                   Companies are about equally divided as to whether they will                   be increasing capital spending in the U.S. or keeping it steady.                   Several respondents are planning overseas expansions, particularly                   in Asia.
In discussing the sales outlook                   for the holiday season and 2004, manufacturing contacts tend                   to be more upbeat than they were earlier in the year. Most firms                   predict rising revenues for 2004. However, they say they are                   guarding against increasing production too much in response                   to positive projections, and they continue to make concerted                   efforts to use their working capital and other resources as                   efficiently as possible.
Some respondents believe labor                   supply is tightening. Bill rates and pay rates are stable. Non-payroll                   related costs are said to be under control, except for medical                   insurance.
Respondents are more optimistic                   than three months ago, with most anticipating that growth in                   labor demand will be sustained through 2004. While contacts                   are pleased by rising labor demand, the performance of the stock                   market, and recent GDP and payroll employment reports, they                   express concern about shifts in IT employment abroad, rising                   healthcare costs, federal budget deficits, and terrorism.
The rest of New England is stable.                   Contacts report little activity in commercial markets. Office                   vacancy rates have increased somewhat in the Portland area,                   and dropped slightly in Providence. Elsewhere, vacancy and rental                   rates remain steady. The retail sector is relatively strong                   throughout the region (in greater Boston, the only new development                   is in the suburban retail sector). Contacts do not anticipate                   that commercial markets will rebound for at least a year, and                   some believe that the Boston office market will not improve                   until 2007 or 2008, when most leases will be rewritten.
The outlook of software and IT                   services firms has moved from cautious to optimistic, even for                   companies who previously said they were uncertain about the                   economy's future course. While revenue expectations for the                   first quarter of 2004 range from flat to double-digit increases,                   the prevailing opinion is that gradual improvements in the software                   sector will persist.
