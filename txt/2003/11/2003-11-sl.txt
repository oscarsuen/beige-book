Business activity in the Eighth District continues to show signs of improvement, especially in manufacturing, although reports of plant closings, downsizing, and layoffs continue.  Firms in the services sector have reported improvement in business activity and plans for expansions and new hiring.  Retail sales in September and October increased over 2002 levels, while auto sales declined over the same period.  Residential real estate markets in the District continue to be robust, while commercial markets remain relatively weak.  Overall lending activity at a sample of District banks experienced little change over the past three months.
Car dealers in the District reported that, compared with last year, sales in September and October were slightly down, on average.  Most contacts attributed this decline to high summer sales because incentives were offered, effectively transferring sales to the summer from the fall.  More than 35 percent of the car dealers surveyed noted that sales of used and low-end cars have increased, while a small percentage reported higher sales of trucks and SUVs.  About 60 percent of the contacts reported increased use of rebates, and 25 percent noted that acceptance rates for finance applications have increased.  More than 50 percent of the contacts reported that their inventories are at desired levels, while another 30 percent noted excess inventories, particularly for new cars.  The car dealers surveyed remain cautiously optimistic about the next two months, with more than 60 percent of the contacts expecting sales to remain flat or to increase slightly over last year.
Despite the positive outlook, there have also been several announcements of plant closings, downsizing, layoffs, higher operating costs, low sales volumes, and negative profits; affected industries include electronics and electronic components, tools, instruments, clothing, linen, food, and chemicals.  In the services sector, firms in the entertainment, investment banking, debt collection services, health services, and automated personnel services industries reported improvements in business activity and plans for expansion and new hiring.  Firms in the customer support systems, credit card systems, data management, savings and loans, and airline industries reported reduced business activity and plans for layoffs.  Higher utility prices, fewer orders, weaker production, and increased health insurance costs are among the factors reported as hindering economic activity in the District.
