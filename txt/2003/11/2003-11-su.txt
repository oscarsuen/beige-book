Reports received from the District Banks suggest that the economy continued to expand in October and early November.  Descriptions of the pace of growth varied somewhat.  But improvements appeared to be reasonably broadly based, with most districts noting growth in a number of industries.  Overall, wages and prices of finished goods and services remained fairly stable, although some increases in input prices were noted.

Reports from the banking sector generally indicated subdued loan demand and some increase in investment banking activity.  Agricultural conditions were good in most reports, while activity in energy-related industries was mixed.  Labor markets conditions generally stabilized after an extended period of weakness.  Several districts noted a slowing in layoffs and stronger demand for temporary workers. Consumer spending Reports on retail spending were generally positive, although some weakness was attributed to unseasonably warm weather in several parts of the country.  Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Kansas City indicated that sales exceeded year-ago levels, while San Francisco described sales as "solid."

Removal of generous factory incentives reportedly drove down sales in the Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts; St. Louis noted that the incentives might have shifted sales into the summer from the fall.  Chicago also indicated that sales weakened.  Philadelphia, in contrast, reported a pickup in sales in early November because of new manufacturers' incentives after a "relatively sharp" drop in sales in October; Cleveland similarly noted that sales were tied to incentives.  Kansas City reported that despite aggressive manufacturer incentives, sales improved more for used cars than for new cars.  Boston reported strong sales of imported models but mixed results for domestic models.  Several districts noted that manufacturers are expected to roll out new incentive programs to boost sales in the coming months. Tourism and Services Activity in the tourism and hospitality industry improved moderately overall, according to most reports, but business travel remained subdued and international tourism was still weak.  Early snows and cold conditions in ski areas pushed up demand in the San Francisco district.    New York reported that occupancy rates at Manhattan hotels were up noticeably from a year ago.  Minneapolis reported "generally solid" tourism activity.  According to Richmond, coastal areas were still recovering from damage caused by Hurricane Isabel, but mountain areas were booked almost to capacity for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Atlanta reported increased traffic at amusement parks and tourist attractions in central Florida because of deals and discounts; south Florida's cruise industry continued to report strong numbers, and advance bookings at resorts and hotels are reportedly encouraging.  San Francisco noted that the number of international visitors to Hawaii remained soft, but the weaker dollar is expected to boost traffic in coming months. Business conditions also generally improved in other service industry sectors.

Dallas, Boston, San Francisco and Minneapolis noted positive reports among manufacturers of various high-tech products.  Demand increased for building materials suppliers in the Atlanta and San Francisco districts.  Cleveland reported that automakers and some steel producers increased activity and that most nondurable producers there indicated "little if any" spare capacity.  Higher levels of capacity utilization were also noted in the Kansas City district.  St. Louis reported that the manufacturing sector showed signs of improvement despite some plant closings and layoffs.  Less positively, Dallas reported continuing overcapacity in the petrochemical industry, and Atlanta and Richmond noted weakness in textile or apparel production.

Chicago reported that the mid-priced housing market softened somewhat from earlier reports but that some areas experienced a small uptick in luxury housing markets; Kansas City noted mixed results for high-end construction.  Residential activity is expected to remain robust overall into next year, by most accounts. Most districts once again characterized commercial real estate markets as currently weak.  However, the outlook was a bit more upbeat, with strengthening anticipated next year in many districts.  Vacancy rates remained at high levels across most markets; however, there were scattered reports of small improvements in leasing or construction activity in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts.

Banking and Finance Loan activity was subdued in most districts.  St. Louis and Chicago reported little change in overall lending activity.  Loan demand was characterized as flat by Richmond, slowly increasing by Dallas and mixed by Cleveland.  Outstanding loan volume moved up slowly in the Philadelphia district in November, and some banks there were limiting their residential real estate lending to prevent mortgages from becoming too large a portion of their loan portfolio.  New mortgage originations were fairly strong in the Philadelphia, Chicago and San Francisco districts.  Refinancing activity slowed in all districts that commented on mortgage lending.

Merger and acquisition activity began to rise from low levels in the Chicago and Dallas districts.  Philadelphia said that demand for business financing prompted an increase in investment banking activity, while venture capital firms were beginning to evaluate start-up projects in the Atlanta district.  However, Dallas reported that there was still "not a lot" of IPO activity. Agriculture and Natural Resources Favorable weather and improved market conditions continued to benefit farmers and ranchers in most districts reporting on agricultural activity.  Mild, dry weather boosted farm production in Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis and Kansas City districts.  San Francisco also noted increased yields, while Chicago and Minneapolis reported improved conditions for most agricultural products.  Kansas City and Dallas reported that market conditions were mostly good for cattle ranchers, but dry weather hurt cotton growers in the Dallas district.

Richmond noted that economic conditions in Central Appalachian coal fields were "favorable," with higher capital investment in new mining equipment expected.  Minneapolis reported that activity in the energy and mining sectors was stable, and Kansas City reported that energy activity was strong.

Natural gas providers in the San Francisco district are reportedly fully stocked for the winter season. Labor Markets, Wages and Prices Labor markets across the nation generally improved or remained stable, with several districts noting a slowing in layoffs.  Stronger demand for temporary workers was noted by Boston, Richmond and Minneapolis; Chicago added that the higher demand for temps was widespread.  Several districts indicated that firms are waiting for sustained increases in orders before hiring permanent workers, although Boston reported some increases in permanent placements by temp agencies.  Firms had difficulty finding some specialized workers in the Kansas City district, but labor markets remained slack there overall.  Dallas and San Francisco also reported slack labor markets, although Dallas did note fewer layoffs.  Minneapolis also reported increased hiring plans in some areas.  Labor markets remained steady in the Cleveland and Atlanta districts as a whole, with few signs of impending increases in employment. Wage pressures were mostly subdued, although almost all districts reported concerns about escalating health and other insurance costs.  Several districts noted that employers were shifting more health insurance costs onto employees, with Kansas City adding that some small firms are eliminating health insurance entirely.  Dallas cited rising health insurance costs as a factor, making firms reluctant to add new employees.  New York reported that bonuses in the securities industry are expected to be 20 percent higher than last year. Increases in some commodity prices were noted. Several districts noted higher prices for plywood and steel, and Kansas City also reported price increases for brick and cement. Dallas noted higher prices for primary metals, while Chicago reported a rise in prices for some heavy equipment and gypsum wallboard. Boston noted concern about upward price pressure due to higher transportation costs after new trucking regulations are implemented, while Dallas said that the regulations might also make it more difficult to hire drivers. San Francisco noted that residential rebuilding after the recent fires in Southern California is likely to boost prices of building materials and wages of construction workers.
