Contacts reported that economic activity remained subdued in the Sixth District during late November and December.  Merchants' sales were mixed and discounting was widespread over the holiday period.  Auto sales, however, improved in December.  Although single-family residential building and sales cooled a little in some areas, District housing markets posted strong figures overall, and listings were reported as balanced.  Weak demand continued to plague commercial real estate markets and vacancy rates remained high.  Factory activity was sluggish, with new layoffs in some sectors and slowing production in others.  Reports on tourism and hospitality improved, but the business travel sector remained weak in most areas.  Labor markets were lackluster, and there were few signs of significant improvement.  Price increases remained limited.  Heavy rains adversely affected some District crops.
District car sales weakened further in November but improved in December, according to contacted dealers.  A major producer reported that car and truck sales in November were off from a year earlier.  Used auto sales in December were mixed, with wholesale auctions in Atlanta troubled by below-average dealer participation and high inventories.  However, Florida's used car sales auctions surged in December because of strong demand from out-of-state dealers attracted by bargain offerings from fleet and lease companies.
Health-care costs continued to escalate.  Staff shortages were resulting in double-digit wage increases for hospital workers.  Contacts reported that group health-care premiums were expected to increase at double-digit rates in 2003.  There were also widespread reports of rising energy prices in December.
