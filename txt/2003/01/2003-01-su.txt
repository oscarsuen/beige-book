Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated subdued growth in economic activity from mid-November through early January, with little change in overall conditions relative to the last survey period.  Most Districts characterized growth as "sluggish" or economic activity as "soft" or "subdued."  The weakest report came from Dallas, where economic activity "remained anemic."  As in the last survey, conditions in the New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts were more favorable overall than in other Districts, with each, especially New York, describing various signs of improvement.
Reports on consumer spending were consistently weak, with disappointing holiday sales that, in nominal terms, mostly were at or below last year's levels.  Automobile sales surged at year-end in response to favorable sales incentives.  Manufacturers expanded production a bit on balance, with notable gains for defense-related and biomedical products.  Providers of nonfinancial services saw little change in existing weak demand, and business travel remained slow, although there were some reports of improved performance in the tourism sector. Home sales and residential construction activity remained at high levels but slowed a bit in some areas, and the widespread overhang of commercial real estate persisted.  Agricultural production was hampered by adverse weather in some areas and performance was mixed.  Extraction activity in the energy sector responded very little to sharp increases in energy prices.  Bank lending continued to expand in most Districts due to strength in consumer and real estate borrowing.  Labor demand was mostly flat, and despite rising costs for employee benefits and some inputs, increases in employee compensation and final prices were held down by competitive supply conditions.
In most areas, sales were stronger at large               discount chains than at traditional, higher-priced department and               specialty stores. Consistent with these observations, substantial               discounting on holiday retail sales items was reported in all Districts,               with Chicago explicitly noting deeper discounting compared with               a year earlier. New York and Philadelphia reported moderate accumulation               in retail inventories, but other Districts reported generally balanced               inventories, due to a combination of conservative planning and the               dominant role of low prices rather than low sales volume in determining               weak nominal sales revenues.
Among product lines, the strongest holiday sales               were recorded for consumer electronics and toys. Automobile sales               showed signs of weakening in some areas, but according to Philadelphia,               Cleveland, and Chicago, favorable year-end financing and price incentives               produced a sales flurry in late December, lifting overall sales               to high levels for the survey period.
Demand for high-tech products was flat or improved a bit in Dallas and San Francisco, with the latter reporting increased sales of semiconductors for use in wireless technologies.  Boston, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco cited sales gains for pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and defense-related equipment.  Manufacturing activity increased slightly in the Minneapolis District, with expanding capacity and production levels reported in the heavy machinery, metals, and electronics sectors.  Automobile manufacturers in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts faced mostly stable demand, with a sales surge at the end of the year helping to bring inventories down from November's excessive levels.  Declines in construction-related manufacturing were reported in Chicago and Dallas, and Richmond reported weak demand conditions for apparel manufacturers.
Most Districts reported little or no increase in capital spending by manufacturers.  Atlanta noted declining demand for capital goods, and Kansas City indicated that capital spending fell in December after having firmed in October and November.  Looking ahead, Philadelphia reported that the number of firms intending to boost capital spending in the first half of 2003 fell recently, and capital spending among manufacturers in the San Francisco District is being held down by excess capacity that is expected to persist for six months or more at the current pace of expansion.
Demand for business and professional services was somewhat weak               and, overall, exhibited little change from the previous survey period.               Philadelphia and Richmond described overall demand for services               as "flat" or "steady." Dallas noted slow demand for accounting and               legal services, and in the San Francisco District demand for advertising               and related media services was soft. Boston reported good sales               and revenues for insurance companies but noted that poor investment               results kept hiring and capital spending frozen. Demand for trucking               services remained strong in the Cleveland District despite a slowdown               in December that was larger than the usual seasonal lull, and St.               Louis reported steady demand for trucking but uneven profits due               to rising fuel costs. Relative to seasonal norms, hiring or planned               hiring of temporary service workers was slow in Philadelphia, Richmond,               and Dallas. By contrast, New York reported "brisk," broad-based               hiring of temps in December.
Performance indicators               in the travel and tourism sector were mixed. New York reported higher               hotel occupancy and room rates compared with a year earlier. In               the Atlanta District, hotel bookings in tourist areas have climbed               back near their levels from the year 2000, although convention business               in Atlanta has been hampered by persistent weakness in business               travel. Atlanta and Richmond indicated that travelers are delaying               travel plans to an unusual degree, and New York noted that recent               figures on advance ticket sales for Broadway theaters were running               15 percent below a year earlier. Because of favorable weather conditions,               early season ski receipts were excellent in the Richmond, Kansas               City, and San Francisco Districts. However, Richmond reported weakened               tourism in coastal areas, and Minneapolis reported sparse snow and               a slow start to its winter sports season. In the San Francisco District,               hotel occupancies have returned to normal in Hawaii but have been               low elsewhere. Demand for airline services generally remained weak,               although Dallas noted that holiday travel for some airlines was               better than expected.
Residential construction activity and home sales remained at high               levels in most Districts, although there were numerous reports of               slight cooling in market activity. Reported activity was strongest               in the Richmond District, where growth in home sales remained strong               and the housing market was described as "tremendously active." Market               activity was down somewhat in the Boston, New York, Cleveland, Chicago,               Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, due in part to normal               seasonal slowing. St. Louis indicated that home demand may be leveling               off. In Atlanta, home sales fell in December after an increase in               November. Construction activity was at "low levels" in the Dallas               District, although lower-priced homes (below $250,000) sold "briskly."               Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago also reported stronger demand for mid-               and entry-level homes and condominiums than for more expensive residences.
The markets for commercial               real estate continued to exhibit substantial slack in all Districts.               Richmond and St. Louis described demand for office and industrial               space as "sluggish" or "slow," while office vacancy rates increased               slightly in Minneapolis-St. Paul, the city of Chicago, and parts               of the Kansas City District. In the Cleveland District, commercial               building activity remained at low levels, but builders reported               a significant increase in the number of prospective projects. Minneapolis               reported low vacancy rates for retail space and a corresponding               increase in planned retail construction. Although San Francisco               reported a decline in office vacancies in Los Angeles, contacts               from that District and Dallas expect little overall change in commercial               construction activity over the next two years.
Agricultural output and performance was mixed across Districts,               as adverse weather conditions hampered agricultural production activity               in some areas. Chicago reported high yields and high prices for               a variety of crops. There and in the St. Louis District, the value               of farmland rose markedly, and bankers in the Kansas City District               reported good credit quality for their farm loan portfolios. San               Francisco noted improved sales of agricultural products, due in               part to increased overseas demand spurred by the weaker dollar.               By contrast, Minneapolis reported deterioration in performance in               the agricultural sector. Moreover, heavy rain and otherwise inclement               weather limited yields and production activity for a wide variety               of crops in the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts,               while lack of moisture is likely to limit yields for the winter               wheat crops in Minneapolis and Kansas City.
Activity in the energy               and mining sectors was flat or up slightly on net. Mining activity               in the Minneapolis District continued at high levels. Minneapolis               and Kansas City reported no change in extraction activities for               oil and natural gas, and Dallas reported only a slight increase,               despite a sharp rise in the prices of oil and natural gas. In addition,               Dallas noted that inventories of natural gas and crude oil were               well below year-earlier levels.
Loan demand was up on net, mainly reflecting strength in consumer               and real estate lending. Business loan demand remained somewhat               depressed in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco               Districts, and it fell further in Dallas. Kansas City reported a               slight weakening in all loan categories and tightened credit standards.               By contrast, Philadelphia reported modest increases in all categories.               Contacts in New York and St. Louis saw a pickup in commercial and               industrial loans, with New York reporting tightened credit standards               for that category. Household loan demand remained strong in most               areas, especially for home financing. However, household loan demand               fell a bit in Atlanta, and both demand and quality were quite weak               for household loans in Dallas.
