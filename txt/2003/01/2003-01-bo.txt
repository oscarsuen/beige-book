The First District economy remains soft, but                   business contacts appear to be somewhat more confident that                   they can cope with a period of slow activity than they were                   earlier in 2002. Most New England manufacturers report no increase                   in demand for their products. Retail respondents indicate sales                   were below expectations in the October-December period. Residential                   real estate markets are slowing but perhaps only seasonally.                   Insurance companies cite gains.
Home furnishing retailers experienced a pickup in sales in November, but sales weakened through December; the timing of the holidays and the weather are said to be among the causes of the slowdown.  An electronics retailer continues to experience soft sales, while an office supply store indicates sales are steady.  Wireless, digital, and imaging products are reported to have sold well this quarter.  A high-end shoe retailer says sales were strong in first quality retail stores, while outlet stores failed to meet expectations.  Lumber and home building suppliers, in a seasonal lull, experienced mixed fourth quarter results, as low lumber prices continue to hinder profits.  Auto sales are slower, as is typical at this time of year.  However, car sales in 2003 are expected to be disappointing compared to 2002.
Most retailers are keeping inventories tight, but some auto dealers report inventories are slightly higher than anticipated.  Overall, capital spending is limited to required IT upgrades and purchases.  With the exception of two contacts who cut their headcounts 5 percent or less, retailers say employment is steady.  Wage increases, where they are occurring, are reported to be minimal--below 3 percent.  The more optimistic retail contacts do not expect sales to pick up until the third quarter of 2003, while others see no signs of improvement.
Selling prices remain under competitive pressure.  Contacts increasingly mention competition from foreign suppliers, particularly Chinese, which they expect to be a long-term phenomenon.  Nevertheless, some firms indicate that they will attempt to raise selling prices in an effort to cover higher costs for items such as insurance, plastics, and steel.
Most manufacturing contacts say they are reducing employment or holding it steady, although some are cautiously undertaking selective hiring.  Several firms report plans to ease restrictions on pay increases in 2003, resulting in merit raises in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent.
Capital spending plans for 2003 are mixed.  Some respondents indicate that weak demand, excess capacity, and profit pressures will result in curtailments relative to earlier plans.  However, others report some "loosening of the purse strings," including capital spending initiatives to increase productivity.
Manufacturers are anticipating that conditions will improve somewhat in 2003.  Some say that their business results could exceed their conservative projections, barring unexpectedly severe shocks to the economy emanating from international events.
Life insurance providers report strong results in traditional life insurance                   despite rising compensation costs and flat product pricing.                   Employment remains level and capital budgets are static. Providers                   of disability insurance report higher levels of disability claims;                   these together with low interest rates are squeezing profits.                   Revenues are slightly below target, with a consequent slowdown                   in planned capital spending and hiring. According to most respondents,                   the risk of war with Iraq creates demand uncertainties, as clients                   in troubled sectors may further cut spending. Apart from external                   risk, respondents expect gradual growth similar to that in last                   quarter.
