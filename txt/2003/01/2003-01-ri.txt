Fifth District economic growth remained sluggish in the weeks since our last report as modest growth in the services sector was tempered by sluggish growth in retail sales. Retail sales increased modestly in November, but growth was sluggish on balance, in December. Services businesses reported moderately higher revenues in November, but a leveling of activity in December. In manufacturing, shipments were flat and new orders showed fledgling growth in the weeks since our last report. District home sales remained exceptionally strong, but leasing in the commercial real estate sector was sluggish. Price pressures remained modest throughout the District's economy. In agriculture, above-normal rainfall slowed cotton and soybean harvesting and limited plantings in many areas.
In the commercial sector, realtors reported sluggish leasing activity in recent weeks, though they attributed much of the lull to a customary seasonal slowdown. On the industrial front, a Charlotte, N.C., contact summed up conditions in the sector as "slow to partly cloudy." Demand for office space also remained sluggish across the District, but a contact in Greenville, S.C., reported that while interest in purchasing property by occupants remained low, investor interest continued to rise. The supply of vacant space across market sectors varied little from our last report.  Likewise, rent levels were generally unchanged in the office and retail sectors. In the industrial market, however, contacts noted that landlord concessions were more widespread for warehouse space. Despite the holiday stall, a number of contacts voiced optimism about the coming year.
