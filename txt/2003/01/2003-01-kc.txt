The Tenth District economy was very sluggish in December.  Holiday retail sales were little changed from a year ago, energy activity failed to rise despite higher prices, and commercial real estate activity remained soft.  Moreover, motor vehicle sales eased again and manufacturing activity weakened after showing signs of stabilizing in the fall.  On the positive side, housing activity maintained a solid pace, and tourism was very strong at ski resorts in the Rocky Mountains.  In the farm economy, many ranchers and farmers continued to suffer from drought conditions.  Wage and price pressures remained largely subdued across the district, although some materials prices rose slightly.
