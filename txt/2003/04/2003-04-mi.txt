Ninth District economic activity decreased slightly in March                 and early April. The manufacturing, commercial real estate, consumer                 spending, and mining sectors were down. Although the energy sector                 was flat, winter tourism activity rebounded somewhat after a slow                 start. Residential real estate and agriculture grew. Over this                 period, labor markets loosened somewhat. Overall wage and price                 increases were modest. Significant price increases were noted                 in insurance and natural gas, and decreases were noted in gasoline.
Residential building and real estate activity continued to show                 signs of strength. Housing units authorized in District states                 were up 15 percent for the three-month period ending in February                 compared with a year ago. A western Montana bank director noted                 recent strong residential real estate activity. Although the apartment                 vacancy rate in Sioux Falls recently reached its highest level                 since 1996, developers are adding more units.
Auto sales in Minnesota were very weak in February and March                 compared with a year ago; however, sales picked up by early April                 due to incentives, according to a representative of an auto dealers                 association.
Winter tourism activity rebounded somewhat after a slow start.                 The winter tourism season began slower than last year in Montana,                 according to an official; conversely, February and March were                 relatively strong. Lodging and visits to tourist destinations                 were up from a year ago in South Dakota. An official in the Upper                 Peninsula of Michigan reported a solid winter tourism season;                 however, traffic crossings at the International Bridge at Sault                 Ste. Marie were down 11 percent in March compared with a year                 ago.
In contrast, a reservation center in South Dakota will add up                 to 200 jobs this spring. A new call center in Fargo, North Dakota                 will employ 200 workers within two years. Nurses remain in short                 supply in many areas of the District.
Wage increases were moderate. A bank director reported that wage                 increases were generally in the neighborhood of 2 percent to 3                 percent over a year ago.
Although overall price increases were modest, significant price                 increases were noted in insurance and natural gas. Bank directors                 reported generally slight increases in prices, but mentioned significant                 increases in health and liability insurance. Small businesses                 in Minnesota expect double-digit increases in health insurance                 this year. Residential natural gas prices increased 15 percent                 in March compared with a month earlier. In contrast, as of early                 April, regular gasoline dropped 23 cents from a month ago and                 6 cents from a year ago in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
