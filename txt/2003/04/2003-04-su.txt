Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggested that the pace of   economic activity continued to be lackluster during March and the first two   weeks of April. Although Richmond observed continued modest growth, reports   from Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized   economic conditions as still mixed or soft. Since the last Beige Book, New York,   Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted that the recent pace   of economic activity had been slower than reported earlier. The onset of the   war with Iraq appeared to have some effect on sales and spending, although it   is too early to ascertain the full effect of the war on both consumer and business   confidence.
Reports on consumer spending were generally weak in March, but respondents   attributed part of the weakness to poor weather and the onset of war. Contacts   also cautioned that year-over-year comparisons of sales for March were difficult   because Easter fell in late March last year but falls in the third week of April   this year. Optimism remained that the retail environment would improve within   the next six months.
Most Districts continued to report weakness in manufacturing, although some   pockets of growth were noted in most of the reports. Businesses continued to   report a cautious attitude toward spending, and commercial real estate was reported   to still be in a slump. In contrast, homebuilding activity remained strong across   all Districts. Mortgage lending, buoyed by refinancing activity, remained strong,   and a few Districts noted some improvement in commercial loan demand. Agriculture   conditions generally improved as rain and snow eased drought conditions in several   Districts. Labor markets remained soft, but some Districts noted moderating   layoffs or improvements in demand for temporary labor.
Overall consumer spending remained subdued in March. Although some of the weakness   is attributable to Easter falling later this year, the onset of military action   in Iraq and poor weather also had negative effects on March sales figures in   most Districts. Atlanta and San Francisco, however, noted that March sales were   "near year-ago levels" and "largely stable on net" respectively.
Although retail sales have been sluggish, most Districts indicated that their   retailers were not concerned about inventory levels. Cleveland, Atlanta, and   Chicago reported heavy discounting or increased promotional environments. The   outlook among retailers in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis suggested   that at least a slight improvement in conditions would occur in these Districts   before the close of 2003.
Reports regarding automobile sales in March were mixed: The Cleveland, Richmond,   Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco auto markets saw some rebound   in March after slowing in February. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and   Kansas City, on the other hand, reported faltering auto sales in March, although   Minneapolis and Kansas City saw some recovery in auto sales in early April in   response to manufacturers' incentives.
Travel and tourism spending strengthened in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and   Kansas City Districts, but slowed in the Chicago and San Francisco regions.   San Francisco noted that international travel had weakened, due in part to the   SARS outbreak in Asia. Dallas observed a decline in air travel due to the onset   of the war and the SARS outbreak. Atlanta reported mixed conditions: Although   international tourism fell in the District, the decline was offset by a successful   spring break season.
Nine of the twelve Districts reported slowing activity in manufacturing. New   York and Dallas reported mixed conditions, and Cleveland reported flat or slightly   improving conditions. In general, contacts reported lower levels of production,   sales, and new orders.
Still, pockets of improvement in the industry were noted by more than half   the Districts in this report. In Boston, companies producing hardware, semiconductors,   and machine tools reported an increase in business activity, as did nondurable   goods producers in the Cleveland District. Atlanta's defense-related manufacturers   reported improving conditions, and the hiring of temporary workers in manufacturing   rose slightly. In the St. Louis District, some auto parts producers were planning   to expand their facilities. The energy-related sector in Dallas observed strong   growth since the last report. Despite declining conditions at the time of the   survey, manufacturers in the New York and Philadelphia Districts seemed optimistic   that activity would improve somewhat within the next six months.
Residential activity remained strong while commercial building activity continued   to be characterized as sluggish. Most Districts reported high levels of residential   building activity and sales. Still, some homebuilders suggested that there was   a slight softening in their markets: In the Boston District, sales were being   limited by supply, and in New York and Atlanta, demand for higher-end homes   had eased.
On the commercial side, weakness in construction activity persisted as none   of the Districts reported solid improvements in the industry. Office vacancy   rates continued to climb in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis,   Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and some Districts reported   falling rental prices.
Home lending activity, fueled mainly by refinancing, remained strong across   all Districts, but the Chicago District noted some slowing in mortgage activity.   Consumer and commercial lending was generally flat, although some bankers in   the Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco Districts saw slight increases   in commercial loan demand. Several Districts reported growth in deposits, but   New York reported a decline. Richmond noted a decline in consumer credit demand   as clients were paying down their debts.
Recent precipitation has helped to allay fears of continued drought in the Richmond,   Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Farmers in the Kansas City District   expected to strengthen their balance sheets if relief from drought conditions   continues. Various Districts reported stable or rising commodity prices for   items such as sugar cane, vegetables, cattle, cotton, tree fruits, and nuts,   but prices for milk remained low. The Atlanta and Chicago Districts reported   that higher energy prices have resulted in higher market prices for farming   inputs, but in Chicago it did not appear to have a large effect because most   farmers had negotiated contracts when input prices were lower.
Most District reports indicated continued weakness in labor markets, as several   Districts noted substantial layoffs in March and early April. Still, some hints   of improvement had emerged: Both Cleveland and Kansas City reported fewer plans   for staff reductions, while New York, Atlanta, and Dallas reported stronger   demand for temporary workers. Several Districts reported a lack of upward pressure   on wages, but firms continued to note substantial increases in the costs of   health care and insurance.
Many Districts reported price pressures in specific segments of their economies,   and no reports of widespread inflationary pressures were mentioned. In general,   energy-related inputs in manufacturing saw substantial price increases in March   and early April, but most manufacturers held the prices of their goods steady.   Retailers noted heavy discounting and promotions, with notable drops in apparel   and electronics prices.
