Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggested that the pace of   economic activity continued to be lackluster during March and the first two   weeks of April. Although Richmond observed continued modest growth, reports   from Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized   economic conditions as still mixed or soft. Since the last Beige Book, New York,   Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted that the recent pace   of economic activity had been slower than reported earlier. The onset of the   war with Iraq appeared to have some effect on sales and spending, although it   is too early to ascertain the full effect of the war on both consumer and business   confidence.
Reports on consumer spending were generally weak in March, but respondents   attributed part of the weakness to poor weather and the onset of war. Contacts   also cautioned that year-over-year comparisons of sales for March were difficult   because Easter fell in late March last year but falls in the third week of April   this year. Optimism remained that the retail environment would improve within   the next six months.
Most Districts continued to report weakness in manufacturing, although some   pockets of growth were noted in most of the reports. Businesses continued to   report a cautious attitude toward spending, and commercial real estate was reported   to still be in a slump. In contrast, homebuilding activity remained strong across   all Districts. Mortgage lending, buoyed by refinancing activity, remained strong,   and a few Districts noted some improvement in commercial loan demand. Agriculture   conditions generally improved as rain and snow eased drought conditions in several   Districts. Labor markets remained soft, but some Districts noted moderating   layoffs or improvements in demand for temporary labor.
Although retail sales have been sluggish, most Districts indicated that their   retailers were not concerned about inventory levels. Cleveland, Atlanta, and   Chicago reported heavy discounting or increased promotional environments. The   outlook among retailers in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis suggested   that at least a slight improvement in conditions would occur in these Districts   before the close of 2003.
Reports regarding automobile sales in March were mixed: The Cleveland, Richmond,   Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco auto markets saw some rebound   in March after slowing in February. Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and   Kansas City, on the other hand, reported faltering auto sales in March, although   Minneapolis and Kansas City saw some recovery in auto sales in early April in   response to manufacturers' incentives.
Travel and tourism spending strengthened in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and   Kansas City Districts, but slowed in the Chicago and San Francisco regions.   San Francisco noted that international travel had weakened, due in part to the   SARS outbreak in Asia. Dallas observed a decline in air travel due to the onset   of the war and the SARS outbreak. Atlanta reported mixed conditions: Although   international tourism fell in the District, the decline was offset by a successful   spring break season.
Still, pockets of improvement in the industry were noted by more than half   the Districts in this report. In Boston, companies producing hardware, semiconductors,   and machine tools reported an increase in business activity, as did nondurable   goods producers in the Cleveland District. Atlanta's defense-related manufacturers   reported improving conditions, and the hiring of temporary workers in manufacturing   rose slightly. In the St. Louis District, some auto parts producers were planning   to expand their facilities. The energy-related sector in Dallas observed strong   growth since the last report. Despite declining conditions at the time of the   survey, manufacturers in the New York and Philadelphia Districts seemed optimistic   that activity would improve somewhat within the next six months.
On the commercial side, weakness in construction activity persisted as none   of the Districts reported solid improvements in the industry. Office vacancy   rates continued to climb in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis,   Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and some Districts reported   falling rental prices.
