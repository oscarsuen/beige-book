Contacts indicate that economic activity in the Eighth District                 has remained soft in recent weeks. In manufacturing, there are                 continued reports of plant closings, layoffs, and cutbacks. Retailers                 report that sales were relatively flat compared with last year                 and attribute sluggish consumer spending to colder weather and                 a late Easter, but some are optimistic about spring sales. Home                 sales are still up in most of the District, while commercial real                 estate markets continue to be sluggish. Total loan demand at small                 and mid-sized District banks has weakened throughout the first                 quarter of 2003.
General retail sales in the District were mostly flat in March                 compared with 2002 levels. Some contacts note that colder weather                 and a late Easter are to blame. Several are optimistic about spring                 sales. Auto dealers report that, while March sales were an improvement                 from February, they were still down from March 2002 levels, despite                 the continuation of aggressive incentives. Contacts in the trucking                 industry note that profits shrank because of March's increase                 in fuel prices. To reduce costs, the airline industry has announced                 more cutbacks, which will affect employment in the District.
Commercial real estate markets are still sluggish in most of                 the District. Contacts reported an increase in vacancy rates in                 the office and industrial markets in downtown St. Louis for the                 fourth quarter of 2002. Office vacancy rates also continued to                 increase in Louisville. A recovery in the Memphis area office                 market is not expected until mid-year 2003. Commercial construction                 is still slow in most areas. Contacts in Pine Bluff reported that                 several projects are in process at area colleges but that the                 prognosis for future funding is bleak. Commercial construction                 is lagging in Memphis, while there has been an increase in small                 construction projects in central Kentucky.
Planting intentions for soybeans and wheat declined on average,                 while prospective corn, cotton, and sorghum plantings increased.                 In Mississippi, Kentucky, and Arkansas, farmers planted between                 13 percent and 40 percent less winter wheat in 2002 to 2003 than                 in 2001 to 2002. Contacts say that this decline is due to wet                 fall weather that inhibited planting. In Illinois and Indiana,                 wheat plantings increased 18 percent and 29 percent, respectively,                 possibly marking the beginning of a turnaround from declining                 plantings since 1996. Farmers who were unable to plant wheat in                 the fall may well plant other crops this spring; corn planting                 intentions increased by 8 percent on average, while prospective                 cotton and sorghum plantings increased 7 percent and 9 percent                 respectively.
