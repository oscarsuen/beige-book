Economic growth in the Fifth District continued to be modest in March and early   April as inclement weather and uncertainty about the economy and the war in   Iraq constrained consumer demand. Services businesses reported generally flat   revenues and little change in employment. But retailers said that harsh weather   and the war in Iraq decreased customer traffic and lowered sales substantially.   District manufacturing activity contracted in March, and manufacturers told   us that their hiring and capital investment plans were generally on hold until   the economy improves. In real estate, District home sales rose at a robust pace,   but commercial leasing and construction was generally flat. In agriculture,   excessive rainfall delayed field preparation and crop planting activity in many   areas. Price inflation remained modest in most sectors of the District's economy.
Commercial realtors reported generally flat leasing and construction activity   in recent weeks as international political developments continued to create   considerable uncertainty among clients. "Things are pretty much the same, just   waiting around for some good news," noted a realtor in Baltimore. Rent levels   were down sharply in all commercial sectors. Vacancy rates for office and retail   space held steady, but industrial vacancy rates edged higher. The leasing of   retail space in Richmond continued to be "very strong for the short and long   term," but leasing activity in other commercial sectors remained sluggish. A   realtor in Washington, D.C., said companies were "tightening up" and eliminating   unnecessary office space.
