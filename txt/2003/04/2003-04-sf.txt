Reports from Twelfth District contacts suggest that economic                 growth was sluggish during the period from March through early                 April, with limited negative effects arising from the start of                 military operations in Iraq. Price and wage pressures were minimal,                 and retail gasoline prices largely remained at elevated levels.                 General retail sales held up on net, though they appear to have                 weakened a bit toward the end of the survey period, partly due                 to concerns about the war in Iraq. The war, along with the East                 Asian outbreak of the respiratory ailment "SARS," had a discernible                 negative effect on travel and tourism activity, especially visits                 from abroad. Demand for high-tech equipment and other District                 manufactured products fell slightly on net, and respondents noted                 significant excess capacity for various products. Sales of agricultural                 products were solid, due in part to strong export demand, and                 contacts reported capacity expansion in the fuel and energy sectors.                 Although commercial real estate markets weakened further, home                 demand was strong, although slower activity was reported in some                 markets. Banks and other financial intermediaries saw continued                 weak demand for business loans and strong demand for residential                 mortgages.
Travel and tourism activity fell noticeably in some areas in                 response to the start of the war and the outbreak of the SARS                 epidemic in East Asia. Respondents reported extensive reservation                 cancellations and lower hotel occupancies in Los Angeles, Hawaii,                 and other areas, largely due to a decline in visitor arrivals                 from East Asia. Moreover, airlines cut flights on selected Asian                 and European routes in response to a decrease in bookings and                 lower passenger load volumes. Domestic travel also remained weak.                 Outside of travel-related industries, service demand was largely                 stable, with robust conditions reported for health care and related                 services.
