Business conditions in the Third District softened in April. Manufacturers   reported declines in shipments and new orders compared with March. Retail sales   of general merchandise in early April were running below the rate set in the   same period a year ago, and sales of automobiles and light trucks were off as   well. Bank lending was edging up, with slight gains in business and residential   real estate lending. Business conditions for most of the service firms contacted   in the first half of April were virtually flat.
The outlook in the Third District business community is cautious. Manufacturers   forecast some increases in shipments and orders during the next six months despite   the current weakness, but contacts in other sectors are less optimistic. Retailers   have mixed views. Some expect sales to improve soon, but others believe consumers   will continue to limit spending. Auto dealers expect a lower sales rate in 2003   compared with 2002. Bankers generally expect business and consumer loan demand   to rise very slowly in the next few months, but they anticipate a decrease in   residential real estate lending. Employment agencies forecast very modest increases   in hiring in the second quarter, mainly by financial services firms, but they   anticipate little change in employment in other sectors.
Despite the persistence of weak conditions, the region's manufacturers forecast   better business ahead. Over half of the firms surveyed in April expect increases   in orders and shipments during the next six months, and only one in ten anticipate   decreases. Area manufacturers' capital spending plans call for increases, on   balance, although half of the firms polled in April indicated their capital   expenditures will be steady. Few firms were planning major expansions, and several   noted that outlays for new equipment in the immediate future will be on an as-needed   basis only.
Looking ahead, store executives have mixed views. Some believe the spring season   will bring an upturn in sales once normal weather prevails and the conflict   in Iraq subsides, but others are concerned that consumers will continue to limit   spending until there are positive signs that the economy is improving. Retailers   said they were fully stocked with spring merchandise, as is usual at this time   of year, and they do not anticipate making extensive price reductions unless   sales in the weeks ahead fall significantly below their current expectations.
Auto dealers generally indicated that sales were down in April compared with   March and with April of last year. Although a few dealers saw some continuing   strength in demand for new cars, most said sales have been on the decline and   inventories have increased. Some dealers said that sales of large sport utility   vehicles have been particularly weak since gasoline prices have risen. Although   some manufacturers have stepped up incentives, dealers in the region anticipate   sales for this year as a whole will fall as much as 5 percent from last year.
Investment companies indicated that cash inflow in the past few months has   been running significantly below the pace during the same period a year ago.   Individual investors continue to prefer bonds to equities, and they appear to   be favoring savings accounts over money market funds due to the higher rates   available from depository institutions.
Bankers in the Third District generally expect lending to businesses and individuals   to grow very slowly in the near term, and they anticipate a decline in residential   real estate lending along with lower home sales this year compared with last   year. Investment companies expect continued reluctance by individual investors   to increase the amount of their investments in stocks, but they believe institutional   investors might step up their equity investing later this year.
Employment agencies in the region reported that hiring plans among their client   firms call for some increases in the second quarter but not strong gains. The   best prospects for increased employment are among financial services firms,   according to employment agencies, while most other sectors are expected to see   little change in employment.
