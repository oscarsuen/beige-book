Eleventh District economic activity was mixed from mid-February                 through mid-April. The energy industry, including energy-related                 manufacturing, picked up strongly. But other manufacturing activity                 was mostly flat or down. Activity in the service sector was also                 mixed. Retailers reported a drop in sales. Construction and real                 estate markets continued to be soft, and the financial service                 industry reported little change in activity. Overall agricultural                 conditions remained relatively stable in the last seven weeks.
Contacts vary in their outlook for future activity. There is                 optimism in some industries that activity will pick up soon, as                 uncertainty surrounding the war dissipates. Other contacts are                 more pessimistic about the outlook than they were a few weeks                 ago. These contacts expressed concern that the economy is not                 necessarily going to bounce back quickly after the war because                 businesses are very reluctant to make capital investments until                 they are certain demand is picking up in their industry.
There continue to be widespread concerns about high insurance                 costs. Accounting firms have increased fees to accommodate rising                 insurance costs and additional work imposed by the regulatory                 changes from the Sarbanes-Oxley bill. These firms say that their                 customers are having difficulty passing these higher fees on to                 their selling prices.
Several contacts noted that wage pressures had lessened or the                 company was offering smaller wage increases. Contacts say that                 temporary workers are commanding far lower salaries, particularly                 for sales and marketing, where yearly salaries have dropped from                 $80,000 to $65,000.
Conditions in high-tech manufacturing were flat. Contacts said                 the biggest obstacle to a significant turnaround continues to                 be weak capital spending by businesses. One respondent noted that                 SARS is having significant supply and demand effects in Asia,                 and one of their factories in Asia had been shut down for at least                 10 days after a worker became infected with the illness. Overall                 inventory levels were reported to be lean, and productivity gains                 were helping to improve profits.
Demand for fabricated metals has been flat during the past six                 weeks and slightly down from a year earlier. Contacts said that                 private investment was very weak, but public spending (on construction                 projects) was helping to buoy demand. Demand for primary metals                 was also flat to down over the past six weeks, which contacts                 attributed to a lack of business investment due to the war and                 stiff competition from China. The demand for lumber has increased                 slightly over the past month, but contacts expect a slowdown as                 home building cools. Contacts in the stone, clay, and glass industries                 said the demand has risen over the past six weeks.
Demand for food products has slowed over the past month, and                 contacts say their customers are being cautious in their ordering                 because of the war. Demand at "white table cloth" restaurants                 has weakened, they say, but "middle of the road" restaurants are                 making up for it. Demand for paper products has been "light."                 Paper producers say competitive pressures have been stiff, and                 heavy inventories have led some companies to reduce production                 and lay off employees.
Strong demand and profits have led refiners to run at high levels                 of capacity utilization--higher than 90 percent--in recent weeks.                 Refineries are postponing or minimizing the normal spring turnarounds                 to switch from heating oil to gasoline. Demand for petrochemicals                 has also been strong, particularly for products tied to construction.                 However, high natural gas prices have led some energy-intensive                 plants to shut down, and all plants have struggled to pass through                 the increased cost of production. A substantial increase in basic                 chemical and plastic production was reported in early April after                 natural gas prices fell below $5 per thousand cubic feet.
The airline industry continues with its struggle to find the                 road to solvency. Demand for air travel fell as the war in Iraq                 started; international travel, which was also hurt in areas affected                 by the SARS virus, was particularly hard hit. Some carriers have                 temporarily suspended flights to SARS infected areas. Wage reductions                 and additional layoffs are reducing costs, but costs continue                 to rise due to a snowstorm in the Northeast and hail damage in                 Texas. As one contact noted, "we can't get a break."
Trucking activity improved markedly over the past four to six                 weeks. Rail shipments were also higher than year-ago levels, with                 significant increases in shipments under the category that includes                 military traffic.
Automobile sales in the District remain below year-ago levels,                 although the so-called "CNN Effect" appears to have lifted since                 the start of the war with Iraq.
