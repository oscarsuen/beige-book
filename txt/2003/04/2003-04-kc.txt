The Tenth District economy showed some signs of weakening in                 March and early April, due in part to the onset of war. Retail                 sales as a whole edged down, and manufacturing activity softened.                 In addition, commercial real estate remained in a slump. On the                 positive side, residential real estate activity maintained its                 strong pace, and energy activity continued to expand. In the farm                 economy, recent rain and snow eased drought conditions in some                 areas. Wage and price pressures remained largely subdued across                 the District, although prices for some manufacturing materials                 continued to rise.
District manufacturing activity weakened somewhat in March and                 early April. Although some contacts attributed the softening to                 the onset of war, the majority of firms reported that the war                 was having no effect on their business. Production and shipments                 fell slightly below year-ago levels after rising in recent months,                 and many factories continued to shed employees. Indeed, nearly                 all of the large layoff announcements in recent weeks have been                 from manufacturers. Inventories of finished goods rose moderately                 as some customers delayed their purchases. Despite the recent                 slowing, manufacturers maintained their optimism about future                 production and were increasing inventories of raw materials. Expectations                 for future hiring also remained positive. On the other hand, expectations                 for future capital spending eased somewhat after improving in                 February.
Residential real estate activity in the District continued to                 show strength in March and early April, although commercial real                 estate activity remained weak. Single-family housing starts increased                 further in most District cities, with builders reporting little                 effect from the onset of war. Much of the increase continued to                 be for lower-priced homes, although several contacts mentioned                 some pickup in higher-end homebuilding as well. Builders generally                 expect typical seasonal increases in home construction through                 early summer. Home sales across the District remained relatively                 steady in March and early April, although inventories of unsold                 homes were higher than a year ago in most cities. Many realtors                 reported good buyer traffic in recent weeks and expect solid sales                 to persist into the summer months. Mortgage demand continued to                 be quite strong throughout the District, and lenders generally                 expect demand for both new home loans and refinancings to hold                 steady. In contrast to the residential market, commercial real                 estate activity remained weak across the District in March and                 early April, with some cities experiencing further difficulties.                 Office vacancy rates edged up in Denver and Kansas City, and prices                 of office space in those cities fell slightly. Absorption rates                 were fairly constant across the District, however, and commercial                 realtors generally do not expect further deterioration of office                 markets in coming months.
Bankers report that loans declined and deposits rose since the                 last survey, reducing loan-deposit ratios. Demand increased for                 home mortgage loans and home equity loans but fell for other categories,                 especially commercial and industrial loans. On the deposit side,                 all types of accounts rose except large CDs, which held steady.                 Some respondents attributed the increase in liquid accounts to                 a flight to safety. All respondents left their prime lending rates                 unchanged since the last survey, but half of them reduced their                 consumer lending rates slightly. Lending standards were generally                 unchanged.
District energy activity continued to expand in March and early                 April. By mid-April, the count of active oil and gas drilling                 rigs in the region had risen almost 10 percent from early March                 and nearly 40 percent from the beginning of the year. Although                 energy prices have declined from recent peaks, they remain relatively                 high in comparison to previous years. Natural gas prices are expected                 to stay above average through the summer as companies replenish                 unusually low inventories. In addition, significant new gas pipeline                 capacity from the Rocky Mountains is scheduled to open in coming                 weeks. As a result of these factors, drilling activity is expected                 to remain solid in 2003.
In the District's farm economy, recent rain and snow have eased                 drought conditions in some areas. The precipitation has helped                 pastures, but the damage sustained from the drought will take                 time to overcome. Spring planting conditions have also benefited                 from the moisture. Recent credit reviews suggest that farm borrowers                 were still experiencing some deterioration in their finances in                 drought-stricken areas. Most District bankers remain cautious,                 and some have tightened their farm lending standards. If moisture                 conditions continue to improve, farm balance sheets are expected                 to strengthen this year.
Wage and price pressures remained generally muted across the District,                 although high energy prices continued to squeeze some manufacturers'                 profit margins. Labor markets were still very slack in March and                 early April, and managers reported few problems finding workers.                 However, the pace of layoff announcements continued to ease after                 rising last fall. Wage pressures were virtually nonexistent, and                 some employers have sought to control costs by eliminating matching                 funds for retirement plans. Retail prices continued to ease due                 to promotional discounting, and retailers expect prices to be                 flat to slightly lower in coming months. Manufacturers continued                 to report rising prices for some petroleum-based products, but                 the easing in gasoline prices in recent weeks has led to reductions                 in suppliers' transportation surcharges. Several manufacturers                 also reported that finished goods prices have declined since the                 previous survey after showing signs of firming earlier in the                 year. As in previous surveys, prices for construction materials                 were largely unchanged and are expected to remain flat through                 early summer.
