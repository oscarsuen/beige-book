The Tenth District economy showed some signs of weakening in                 March and early April, due in part to the onset of war. Retail                 sales as a whole edged down, and manufacturing activity softened.                 In addition, commercial real estate remained in a slump. On the                 positive side, residential real estate activity maintained its                 strong pace, and energy activity continued to expand. In the farm                 economy, recent rain and snow eased drought conditions in some                 areas. Wage and price pressures remained largely subdued across                 the District, although prices for some manufacturing materials                 continued to rise.
