After a modest but abrupt slowdown in late February, economic                 activity in the Seventh District showed few signs of improvement                 in March and early April. Many contacts suggested that the February                 slowdown resulted from heightened uncertainty preceding the war                 with Iraq. The war itself appeared to have only a limited impact                 on economic activity and had yet done little to change the overall                 level of uncertainty in the economy. Auto dealers, some other                 retailers, and realtors noted that customer traffic slowed in                 the first few days of the war but quickly rebounded. Manufacturers                 and bankers said that the war was perhaps the latest reason that                 many businesses continued to put off capital spending, hiring,                 and/or borrowing. Progress in the war helped bring down oil prices,                 though many businesses were still struggling with higher input                 costs and very little pricing power. Although drought worries                 have waned, agricultural concerns lingered as farmers' cash flows                 were hampered by delayed government payments, and dairy operations                 struggled with low milk prices.
Overall consumer spending was weak in March and early April. Retailers                 indicated that sales results in March generally met their conservative                 expectations, although they continued to use heavy discounting                 to move merchandise. Inventories were said to be in line with                 sales, as merchants remained vigilant in controlling stocks. District                 auto dealers reported that light vehicle sales improved in March                 from low February levels and were a little better than expected                 given the war. However, showroom traffic slowed in early April                 despite a new round of manufacturers' incentives. Light vehicle                 inventories were generally high, and most dealers reported that                 they were ordering fewer units from manufacturers. Tourism-related                 activities were flat to down in most areas, although one contact                 indicated that hotel occupancy rates in Chicago were up from a                 year earlier. One major theater chain noted that ticket sales                 were off about 10 percent from year-ago levels, which this contact                 said was "partly a product-driven decline."
Businesses across the region remained very cautious about their                 spending and hiring plans. Most contacts indicated that there                 has been no change in economic conditions that would warrant an                 increase in capital expenditures, and many continued to delay                 planned upgrades and expansions. However, some businesses were                 "sitting on cash," which one contact said could boost capital                 spending quickly once aggregate demand picks up. The hiring environment                 remained very weak in most areas as well. Though the majority                 of business contacts suggested that payrolls were relatively unchanged                 in recent weeks, reports of layoffs continued to outnumber reports                 of new permanent hires. Demand for temporary help also remained                 very weak, although one large staffing services firm said that                 year-over-year growth rates had stabilized in March after several                 months of steady declines. With margins being squeezed by increasing                 cost pressures and a lack of pricing power, businesses from across                 the region continued to focus on cutting costs as a means to improve                 profits.
Overall conditions in real estate and construction softened slightly                 since our last report. Realtors said that existing home sales                 were still strong but may have leveled off in recent months, while                 builders suggested that sales and construction of new homes slowed                 somewhat in March. However, some of the slowdown was weather related                 as very cold temperatures in much of the District made it difficult                 for builders to break ground. One builders group also suggested                 that potential homebuyers were rushing to lock in historically                 low mortgage interest rates before they begin to rise, a trend                 that favored existing and nearly complete spec homes. Nonresidential                 real estate activity was stagnant in most of the District. Demand                 for office space remained very weak, and most contacts suggested                 that vacancy rates continued to rise, albeit slightly. Commercial                 realtors in a few areas noted some increase in leasing activity,                 but it was driven by lease renewals and "tenants shuffling around,"                 rather than new demand. However, one contact in the Chicago area                 reported a sharp increase in the number of office property tours                 compared with a year ago, though this had not yet led to any net                 absorption. As a result of continuing weak demand, most contacts                 have again pushed back their forecasts for a recovery in the office                 markets. There was little change in light industrial or retail                 activity, but there were a few reports of a pickup in demand for                 large-scale projects in the health-care, pharmaceutical, and federal                 government sectors.
Manufacturing activity in the District softened slightly in late                 February and March, partly due to slower auto production. Nationwide                 light vehicle sales rebounded modestly in March, from February's                 low levels. However, inventories remained high, and second-quarter                 light vehicle production plans were down from both first-quarter                 and year-ago levels. Demand for heavy equipment was still soft                 in most segments, although a weaker dollar helped boost demand                 according to one producer. While conditions in the heavy truck                 industry generally remained weak, a manufacturer of heavy truck                 engines noted that demand firmed somewhat in the first quarter,                 leading the company to boost production. A large manufacturer                 of home appliances said that shipments in the first quarter were                 down slightly from a year earlier. Many small manufacturers indicated                 that production and new orders remained weak. However, a few in                 the packaging materials and tool and die industries reported steady                 volumes, and one in paper products even planned to expand its                 workforce.
Overall lending activity appeared to slow slightly in March and                 early April. Household loan demand softened somewhat. Many bankers                 said that refinancing activity remained robust but had slowed                 from the torrid pace earlier in the year. Some lenders also noted                 that credit card volumes and auto loan demand had tapered off.                 Standards and terms on household loans were largely unchanged,                 but overall credit quality may have slipped somewhat. There were                 a few new reports of increases in delinquencies and defaults,                 particularly on home-equity and mortgage loans. Business loan                 demand remained weak, with some lenders describing the market                 as "stagnant" and "lacking energy." Most bankers said that overall                 commercial loan volumes were flat to down slightly. However, one                 large bank reported that demand picked up in March, with at least                 some of the increase due to existing customers expanding their                 businesses. Standards and terms for commercial loans were largely                 unchanged. Reports on business loan quality were mixed but generally                 suggested a slight improvement. One contact noted a rise in charge-offs                 related to fraud, and several indicated that banks continued to                 add to their loan-loss reserves.
Contacts continued to report increases in some input costs, but                 an intensely competitive pricing environment helped to keep broad-based                 price pressures in check. Manufacturers again saw increases in                 energy, steel, aluminum, and petroleum-based input costs. Agricultural                 contacts also noted rising fuel and nitrogen costs, though many                 farmers had previously locked in lower prices. Employment costs,                 outside of health insurance premiums, remained largely subdued                 in recent weeks. There were no new reports of upward pressure                 on wages. In fact, one temporary help contact said that many employers                 were pushing across-the-board pay cuts to contain costs. Few businesses                 were able to pass along input cost increases. Rather, many suppliers                 of goods and services indicated that their customers (including                 large manufacturers and retailers) continued to exert pressure                 on them to reduce prices, putting a further squeeze on margins.                 Contacts suggested that retail competition remained intense, and                 most were using more and steeper discounts to move merchandise.
With spring planting under way in some areas, drought concerns                 have been mitigated by recent precipitation across much of the                 District. However, with soil moisture reserves low, timely rains                 will be more essential for good yields this year. Cattle prices                 remained high, while hog prices were lower than a year ago. The                 adverse impact of dropping milk prices on dairy farmers has spread                 to their suppliers, as accounts payable were increasing at an                 "alarming" rate. To generate cash, some dairy farmers were selling                 their cows and renting their land. In areas that had poor yields                 last year, there were reports of farmers being unable to pay off                 their operating lines of credit. Cash flows were also hurting                 from delayed government payments due to changes in federal programs.                 All of these factors have resulted in more demand for operating                 loans. Even so, farmland values have increased because of continued                 demand from investors and recreational users, in addition to urban                 pressures and land exchanges for tax purposes.
