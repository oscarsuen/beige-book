After a modest but abrupt slowdown in late February, economic                 activity in the Seventh District showed few signs of improvement                 in March and early April. Many contacts suggested that the February                 slowdown resulted from heightened uncertainty preceding the war                 with Iraq. The war itself appeared to have only a limited impact                 on economic activity and had yet done little to change the overall                 level of uncertainty in the economy. Auto dealers, some other                 retailers, and realtors noted that customer traffic slowed in                 the first few days of the war but quickly rebounded. Manufacturers                 and bankers said that the war was perhaps the latest reason that                 many businesses continued to put off capital spending, hiring,                 and/or borrowing. Progress in the war helped bring down oil prices,                 though many businesses were still struggling with higher input                 costs and very little pricing power. Although drought worries                 have waned, agricultural concerns lingered as farmers' cash flows                 were hampered by delayed government payments, and dairy operations                 struggled with low milk prices.
