Economic activity in the Seventh District remained sluggish in April and May. The quick end to major military operations in Iraq had not yet brought the boost in economic activity that many contacts had expected. However, most were optimistic about prospects for stronger growth in the second half of the year. Consumers and businesses remained cautious about spending in recent weeks. Housing markets were still robust, but there was little improvement in nonresidential construction and real estate activity. Manufacturing activity was again weak with few signs of strengthening. Lenders reported another surge in residential refinancing activity, although business lending was still weak. Generally sluggish economic conditions further limited increases in prices and wages. Above-average rainfall delayed spring planting for many farmers, but it also helped alleviate drought-like conditions in much of the District.
