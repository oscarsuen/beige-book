Economic activity remained mixed in the Fourth                 District during April and May, with some industries reporting                 improvements and others reporting deterioration over this period.                 On the positive side, most manufacturing contacts noted steady                 or improving production and sales, with the expectation that conditions                 would continue to improve in the near future. Residential homebuilders                 reported strong year-over-year gains in April and May (2002 was                 a record-sales year). Banking, for the second consecutive report,                 noted some improvement in commercial loan demand.
Still, some signs of weakness persisted in the                 economy. Retailers continued to characterize the retail environment                 as soft. Auto dealers reported slowing sales. Commercial builders                 continued to report depressed economic activity. Trucking and                 shipping contacts noted a downturn in activity.
Most contacts in manufacturing and residential                 construction expect conditions to continue improving within the                 next six months, although contacts in retail, trucking and shipping,                 and commercial construction all seemed pessimistic about prospects                 for the last half of the year.
The labor supply remains plentiful, and those firms that are                 hiring reported no difficulty in finding qualified labor. Although                 most firms indicated plans to maintain or augment their current                 workforces, a few firms did report that they planned layoffs.
Overall, prices remained stable in this reporting                 period. The exception appeared to be both rolled and specialty                 steel--prices continued to fall for these commodities in April                 and May.
As was the case in the last report, most manufacturers noted that                 production and sales in May were steady or improving on both a                 monthly and year-over-year basis. Finished goods inventories are                 still lower than year-ago levels for most producers, and the level                 of idle capacity appears to have decreased from the last report.
Roughly one-third of our contacts noted that they                 were hiring, one-third noted keeping their workforce steady, and                 the remaining one-third reported staff reductions. Roughly half                 our contacts noted overtime in recent weeks. Regarding the outlook,                 more than half our contacts expect production and sales to increase                 in the near future.
Auto production fell at most plants in the District in April                 and May, with Districtwide production roughly 10 percent below                 2002 levels, adjusting for models that moved production or were                 discontinued. Four of the five major auto producers in the District                 reported a decline in production from April to May--the declines                 ranged from 15 percent to 25 percent.
Demand for rolled steel softened in May, with contacts                 reporting production roughly 5 percent to 10 percent below April                 levels. Prices continued to fall, and are roughly 10 percent to                 15 percent below their level at the close of 2002. Many contacts                 noted that they would lay-off workers if they were not constrained                 by labor contracts--others noted either a planned workforce reduction                 negotiated into next year's labor contract or temporary two-week                 layoffs. Contacts do not expect conditions to improve.
Specialty steel producers, however, have seen an                 increase in demand, and sales have increased roughly 5 percent                 to 10 percent from one month ago, but they are still below 2002                 levels. Unlike firms in the rolled-steel industry, specialty steel                 producers reported either calling back laid-off employees or expanding                 their workforces.
Retailers continued to characterize the retail environment as                 soft in April and May, with many contacts reporting below-plan                 sales and either flat or year-over-year decreases in comparable                 store sales. Mall traffic continues to be down, and apparel sales                 have been poor, in part due to the cool weather. Some contacts                 noted that they had hoped for a pickup in sales with the resolution                 of the military campaign in Iraq, but this pickup did not materialize.
Prices remained stable in May, and contacts continued                 to manage inventories very conservatively. Although labor is plentiful,                 very few contacts are hiring. Most of our contacts expected flat                 sales in the coming months.
Automobile dealers also noted sluggish activity.                 Despite some improvement in sales in early March, sales for March                 and April were below expectations--one contact noted sales had                 dropped off as much as 25 percent from the previous year. In terms                 of the aggressive incentives being offered, consumers do not appear                 to be as responsive to the current offers as automakers and dealers                 had hoped. Inventories at dealerships have been rising: Contacts                 reported inventories from near seventy-day to ninety-day supplies,                 well over the sixty-day supply that most dealers try to maintain.                 Contacts did not expect conditions to improve--most expect sales                 growth to remain flat through the end of the year.
Homebuilders reported strong sales in April and May, with many                 builders reporting sales increases of more than 10 percent over                 the high level of sales one year ago (2002 was a record-sales                 year for most of our builders)--one contact reported that April                 was his best month on record. The strength in homebuilding does                 not appear to be attributable to one or two specific housing markets;                 rather, it appears to be spread across the District.
Commercial builders, on the other hand, continued                 to report poor conditions. One contact noted that the work his                 firm currently has is not new business, but, rather, projects                 that were postponed last year. Another contact noted that lending                 activity appears to be constraining demand: Although some clients                 are interested in pursuing new building projects, the narrowing                 spread for lenders appears to leave them reluctant to lend money                 for projects.
Although activity from health-care projects has                 slowed some in recent months (most contacts believe it is due                 to consolidation in the industry), the health-care industry continues                 to be one of the few sources of new activity among commercial                 builders. School construction, which has been steady over the                 past two months, remains the other source of new activity in commercial                 construction.
Demand for trucking and shipping was flat in May compared with                 April, and slightly lower than one year ago. Prices in the industry                 have remained stable over the least year, but some contacts speculate                 a price increase may be attempted by carriers sometime during                 the summer if excess capacity in the industry continues to fall                 at the pace it has fallen the last couple of months. The drop                 in excess capacity is due in part to a decision by firms to delay                 purchasing new engines. Many firms remain reluctant to invest                 large sums of money in new, unproven engines that meet the EPA                 regulations that took effect last October. Rather than invest                 in new engines, firms are making expenditures on technology to                 improve efficiency.
For the second consecutive report, a growing number of bankers                 reported slight improvement in commercial loan demand--for this                 report, more than half our contacts reported commercial loan demand                 had increased both year-over-year and year-to-date. Consumer loan                 conditions remained mixed: Half our contacts reported demand was                 slightly up, while the rest reported demand was flat or slightly                 down compared with one year ago.
Most bankers continued to report that growth in                 core deposits was either flat or slightly up. Credit standards                 had not changed, and the number of loan applications remained                 roughly the same compared with one month ago, but a few contacts                 did note deteriorating credit quality among applicants. Most bankers                 reported mortgage, installment, and business loan delinquencies                 were flat or very slightly increased compared with a year ago.
