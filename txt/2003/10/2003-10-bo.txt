According to business contacts                 in the retail and manufacturing sectors, economic activity in                 the First District is largely stagnant. Most merchants report                 sales in September about level with a year ago, while the majority                 of contacted manufacturers indicate that third-quarter revenues                 were below year-earlier levels. Insurance contacts say revenues                 are level, except for some property and casualty insurers who                 indicate their business continues to grow. Demand for residential                 real estate throughout the region is still strong. Respondents                 are not increasing employment levels; retailers are holding headcounts                 steady while most manufacturers continue layoffs. The outlook                 remains cautious.
According to travel and tourism                 contacts, the hospitality industry remains sluggish. Respondents                 in the Boston area report some slight improvements, including                 a modest pick-up in business travelers. Contacts indicate leisure                 travelers continue to favor drive-to destinations for day or weekend                 trips. Prices remain extremely competitive, with many travelers                 choosing to book reservations online for the lowest prices. One                 contact notes future bookings in northern New England are particularly                 weak, with higher-than-usual vacancy rates for the upcoming Columbus                 Day weekend.
Most retail respondents indicate                 they are maintaining lean inventory levels and modest capital                 spending plans. Employment is said to be stable and any wage increases                 are minimal. Vendor prices are reportedly mixed, with notable                 increases in plywood and lumber prices. Many retail contacts note                 slight decreases in selling prices, particularly in the travel                 and tourism sector, but others say their price changes are mixed.                 Overall, most retail respondents expect slow growth over the next                 six months.
Manufacturers report that they                 are paying more for energy, insurance, and euro-denominated inputs.                 Other materials costs remain under control. Most contacts indicate                 that they have little if any scope for increasing their selling                 prices, with the possible exception of new product introductions.
Most of the contacted manufacturers                 are continuing to pare back employment through selective layoffs.                 Pay increases for 2003 are mostly in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent.                 A couple of firms report that their overall capital spending will                 be up this year, but most are holding the line. Some companies                 are undertaking significant IT projects, but simultaneously cutting                 other investments.
In discussing the outlook for 2004,                 manufacturing contacts indicate that their customers are likely                 to remain cautious. To the extent that they foresee improvements                 in their business, manufacturers expect them to be due largely                 to their success in increasing market share through cost cutting                 or product innovation.

While generating many small claims,                 the power outage in August did not have a large financial impact                 on contacted insurance firms. Some companies, however, report                 extending the workweek to 70 hours to meet client needs after                 the outage.
Employment and capital budgets remain                 largely flat, although one company plans to expand substantially                 its capital budget for 2004. The majority of insurance contacts                 is optimistic and expects a continuation of gradual improvements.
