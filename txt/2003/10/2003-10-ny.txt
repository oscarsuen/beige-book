The Second District's economy has shown                 further signs of strengthening in recent weeks. The labor market,                 in particular, has shown signs of firming, while price pressures                 have diminished. Retailers report that sales were mixed but generally                 ahead of plan in September; selling prices are said to be modestly                 lower than a year ago, on average, and retail inventories at desired                 levels. Recent business surveys point to some acceleration in                 manufacturing activity since the last report, as well as a noticeable                 pickup in employment and steady to declining input prices.
Both residential construction and the market                 for existing homes have strengthened. Office vacancy rates in                 and around New York City were generally stable in the third quarter,                 though Manhattan's market is said to have taken on a firmer tone.                 Conditions in New York City's financial industry have reportedly                 improved further since the last report, with brisk growth in revenue,                 profits and compensation, as well as an upturn in industry employment.                 On a less positive note, consumer confidence declined in September,                 to its lowest level since the spring. Also, bankers report weakening                 demand for consumer loans and especially residential mortgages,                 a modest upturn in delinquency rates in these same segments, and                 little change in lending standards.
Consumer confidence weakened in September, according                 to two separate surveys. The Conference Board's survey of residents                 of the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, PA) shows confidence falling                 to a 6-month low, while Siena College's measure, based on New                 York State residents, fell to a 5-month low.
Housing permits in the district rose in August,                 led by a sharp rebound in the multi-family segment in New York                 City. More recently, homebuilders in northern New Jersey report                 continued strong demand in September but one contact expresses                 concern that recent increases in property taxes and mortgage rates                 have crimped affordability. An industry contact notes a steep                 rise in the cost of plywood and OSB (oriented supply board), but                 indicates that labor and other material costs remain in check.
Office vacancy rates in and around New York City                 were generally stable in the third quarter. In Manhattan, contacts                 report some firming: although vacancy rates were little changed,                 the amount of sublease space on the market reportedly declined                 and a number of large leases are said to be pending. Suburban                 markets were mixed but, on balance, stable--vacancy rates increased                 modestly in Westchester County and Long Island, but edged down                 in Fairfield County, Connecticut.
The manufacturing sector has shown increased                 strength in recent weeks, which is apparently beginning to boost                 employment. Our latest survey of New York State manufacturers,                 conducted in early October, points to continued improvement and                 strong optimism about the six-month outlook. Similarly, purchasing                 managers in both the Buffalo and New York City areas report widespread                 increases in manufacturing activity in September, and those in                 Buffalo indicate a significant upturn in employment--the most                 pronounced in five years. Finally, shipping volume through the                 Port of New York and New Jersey expanded at a double-digit rate                 in the third quarter, and the volume of activity is said to be                 well above expectations.
Interest rates rose for all loan categories                 except consumer loans. Most notably, more than half of the bankers                 surveyed report higher rates for residential mortgages. Average                 deposit rates were little changed, on balance. Finally, bankers                 report some increase in delinquency rates on consumer loans and                 residential mortgages, but little change among commercial borrowers.
