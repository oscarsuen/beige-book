Overall Eleventh District economic activity                 showed signs of slowly improving in September and early October.                 While reports were uneven in many sectors, there continues to                 be cautious optimism that the recovery is strengthening. Still,                 most companies indicated a reluctance to expand their payrolls                 without the certainty of a permanent pick-up in demand.
Manufacturing activity was improved, with some                 industries reporting increased sales and optimism. Signs of strengthening                 demand were also appearing in the service sector, although reports                 are mixed. Contacts say that retail sales are slowly and erratically                 improving. There was little change in the energy industry, financial                 services, or construction and real estate markets. Overall agricultural                 conditions remain in good shape despite some weather-related crop                 damage.
The blackout in the northeast knocked out six                 U.S. refineries or about 3 percent of U.S. production and caused                 a brief jump in wholesale gasoline prices. The loss of production                 came at a critical moment, with gasoline inventories about 6 percent                 below year-earlier levels and Labor Day looming as the biggest                 driving day of the year. The spot price rose from $.95 to $1.12,                 but has since fallen back to $.90 or below. Pump prices have fallen                 back as well. Heating oil prices have fallen steadily throughout                 the period, as inventories of distillates have returned to healthy,                 year-ago levels.
Natural gas prices softened in recent weeks from                 $5 per thousand cubic feet to $4.50, as larger than normal increases                 in inventory kept the industry on track to refill storage to normal                 levels by the start of the heating season on November 1. Consumption                 of natural gas continued to decline, and contacts believe natural                 gas is being diverted to storage. Most observers continue to see                 gas production capacity shrinking one to three percent this year.                 Petrochemical prices mostly fluctuated with feedstock costs. Plastic                 product prices were mixed, with polyethylene and polypropylene                 up because of increased demand, and polystyrene down due to weaker                 demand.
Some prices are higher. The high and rising cost                 of health insurance was mentioned by many industries, and was                 noted as one of many deterrents to hiring. Prices are higher for                 some food products despite steep competition because higher input                 costs are being passed along to consumers. Some manufacturers                 indicated concerns about the high cost of utilities. Steel producers                 say that selling prices are beginning to rise despite stiff competition.
Many high-tech manufacturers reported that production,                 orders and sales have continued to grow at the good pace set in                 the second quarter. Demand was reported to be strongest from the                 Asian and U.S. markets. Inventories were reported to be very lean,                 as desired. Most respondents expect growth to continue at a good                 pace over the next six months with one respondent saying that                 for the first time in a long time his outlook is for "reasonable,                 sustainable growth."
Refiners' margins spiked along with wholesale                 prices for gasoline, but margins have fallen back along with price                 to some of the lowest levels of the year. The lower margins should                 lead refiners to schedule routine maintenance over the next few                 weeks, pulling about 3 percent of U.S. production off line at                 any given time.
Petrochemical producers reported little change                 in basic petrochemicals, as demand was slightly weaker, overcapacity                 persisted, and profits were weak. Basic chemical producers report                 losing export markets due to higher costs associated with high                 natural gas prices, making it difficult to judge domestic demand.
Transportation firms reported mixed activity.                 Airlines reported higher load factors but lower profits. Trucking                 firms reported slower activity. The rail industry reported a marked                 increase in shipments of grain (exports)--the result of good crop                 yields in the U.S. and poor harvests overseas.
Legal firms reported some improvement but with                 continued caution about the outlook. In the last month, contacts                 report a steady stream of litigation and bankruptcy work and a                 noticeable increase in transactional and venture capital work.                 Accounting firms also say activity increased in the past month,                 primarily for tax work but with some improvement on the transactional                 side.


The apartment market remained weak. Properties                 that were in the pipeline before the downturn are still being                 built, and demand is low. Occupancy rates are flat to down, and                 rent concessions continued. Contacts in the office market noted                 increased "activity" but said it was mostly due to local companies                 re-negotiating leases or moving to new space within a city. Any                 significant improvement in the office market will depend on a                 markedly improved job picture, according to contacts.
