Factory                 activity showed further signs of stabilizing and transportation                 contacts reported increased freight volumes in September. The                 pace of retail and auto sales moderated somewhat, although several                 reports noted that sales for the month exceeded expectations.                 Commentaries on the District's tourism and hospitality sector                 were mixed: reports from South Florida were mostly upbeat, but                 others were more subdued.

Prices for most goods and services remained                 stable in September.

Local lumber prices were reportedly the highest                 in several years because of wet weather, fires in the West, and                 recent high demand for plywood.
