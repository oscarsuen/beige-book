Business conditions in the Fourth District                   remained mixed in August and September. Residential construction                   activity and mortgage-related lending remained at high levels,                   although some contacts noted a slight deceleration in September.                   Modest improvements were noted in nondurable manufacturing,                   some retail categories, trucking and shipping, and commercial                   lending. Conditions remained steady or weak in durable goods                   manufacturing, apparel and auto retailing, and commercial construction.
Input prices remained the same or rose during                   these months. Manufacturers in particular noted sharp increases                   in energy prices, while builders noted an increase in some of                   their materials costs. Trucking companies reported that fuel                   costs had leveled off.
At worst, contacts expect annual economic activity                   to be the same as in 2002, but many contacts expect higher levels                   of sales and production.
Manufacturing contacts continued to report mixed conditions                   in August and September. Durable goods producers reported steady                   conditions compared with one month ago, but they often reported                   lower sales and production compared with a year ago. On the                   other hand, nondurable manufacturers consistently reported at                   least modest increases in both production and sales. For all                   contacts, inventory levels were flat or lower compared with                   a year ago. Few contacts in nondurable manufacturing reported                   excess idle capacity, but durable manufacturers reported excess                   capacity ranging from 5 to 40 percent. About half of the contacts                   stated that overtime was used, and most experienced no change                   in their employment levels. Input prices were higher than last                   year but were flat relative to July. Increasing prices for utilities                   was of particular concern. A few contacts have increased the                   prices of goods with some success, but most producers left their                   prices unchanged. Most contacts anticipate flat or increasing                   sales and production through the rest of the year.
Auto production increased overall throughout                   the District in September (up 6.6 percent in the last month                   and up 2 percent since a year ago), though a few producers experienced                   declines. This increased production appeared to run counter                   to national trends. Most facilities in the District used overtime                   hours more than usual during the survey period.
Steel production and sales were mixed during                   August and September. Firms in different market sectors continued                   to experience different trends, with those supplying the defense                   industry maintaining high levels of demand while demand from                   aerospace, power generation, and non-residential construction                   continues to be weak. Idle capacity is in the range of 10 to                   40 percent. Inventory levels are low, and most contacts were                   satisfied with current levels. Due to increases in some input                   prices including natural gas, electricity, and ferrous metals,                   steel prices have climbed as well for some contacts. New orders                   are coming at a very slow rate and are flat for most contacts.                   Contacts generally anticipate flat to moderately rising production                   and sales through the rest of 2003.
Retail sales were flat to slightly higher than last year during                   August and September, in some cases, better than expected. Apparel                   sales were again soft, while food and drink, personal care items,                   furniture, and home appliances sold well. Inventories continue                   to be tightly managed and are low compared with historical standards.                   As usual, discount stores fared better than other retail chains.                   Vendor and retail prices continued to be flat in general, although                   sharp increases in meat prices hurt some restaurants. As retailers                   prepare for seasonal hiring, staffing is not expected to be                   a problem this quarter; labor turnover remains low, and prospective                   workers are easily found. Sales for the rest of the year are                   expected to be steady and flat to slightly up from last year.
Auto dealers indicated that September sales                   were poor, much lower than August and September 2002. Used vehicles                   continued to sell well, as did new trucks. Dealer inventories                   have risen and become somewhat "bloated" because of soft sales                   and increased shipments from manufacturers attempting to reduce                   their own inventories as the model-year ends.
Sales were strong in residential construction in August and                   September. In Ohio, August home sales were up 18 percent over                   last year. Some of the increase was attributable to customers                   purchasing in anticipation of rising interest rates. Since rates                   have since flattened, there were some indications activity may                   have slowed slightly in September. Overall, contacts expect                   sales will be strong for the rest of the year and at least as                   high as fourth quarter 2002. Profit margins were somewhat strained                   by rising material costs. Plywood and lumber prices have been                   rising sharply. Contacts indicated that events outside the District,                   particularly rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Isabel and recent                   military purchases of plywood for operations in Iraq, were partly                   responsible for some of the price increases.
Commercial construction was slow during this                   period, and increases noted in the last report appear to have                   been transitory. Conditions have not changed much from the early                   summer. However, most contacts continue to be optimistic about                   future contracts, as discussions about projects have picked                   up and appear to be less tentative than in the past. Several                   contacts noted new project possibilities in manufacturing areas.                   Profit margins continue to be low because of fierce competition                   for the available construction opportunities. A few contacts                   noted slight increases in materials costs.
Activity in trucking and shipping in August and September showed                   modest improvements compared with the same period in 2002. Most                   contacts believed that the uptick in activity represented more                   than just seasonal factors. Retail customers increased their                   demand for trucking and shipping services, while demand from                   manufacturers continued its flat-to-negative trend of the last                   several years. Most firms have an optimistic outlook for the                   remainder of this year and into 2003. Fuel input costs rose                   during the summer driving season, but have since leveled off.

Conditions were again mixed for commercial and consumer loans.                   Contacts reported stable-to-increased demand for commercial                   loans (which are at low levels), while consumer loan activity                   was steady to declining from the high levels seen earlier in                   the year. This drop in demand for consumer loans was driven                   by the drop in refinancing activity, which was caused by the                   recent rise in mortgage rates. Reports regarding the rate of                   loan delinquencies for mortgage, installment, and business loans                   were mixed.
