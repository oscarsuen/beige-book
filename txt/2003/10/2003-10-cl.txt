Business conditions in the Fourth District                   remained mixed in August and September. Residential construction                   activity and mortgage-related lending remained at high levels,                   although some contacts noted a slight deceleration in September.                   Modest improvements were noted in nondurable manufacturing,                   some retail categories, trucking and shipping, and commercial                   lending. Conditions remained steady or weak in durable goods                   manufacturing, apparel and auto retailing, and commercial construction.
Input prices remained the same or rose during                   these months. Manufacturers in particular noted sharp increases                   in energy prices, while builders noted an increase in some of                   their materials costs. Trucking companies reported that fuel                   costs had leveled off.
At worst, contacts expect annual economic activity                   to be the same as in 2002, but many contacts expect higher levels                   of sales and production.
Auto production increased overall throughout                   the District in September (up 6.6 percent in the last month                   and up 2 percent since a year ago), though a few producers experienced                   declines. This increased production appeared to run counter                   to national trends. Most facilities in the District used overtime                   hours more than usual during the survey period.
Steel production and sales were mixed during                   August and September. Firms in different market sectors continued                   to experience different trends, with those supplying the defense                   industry maintaining high levels of demand while demand from                   aerospace, power generation, and non-residential construction                   continues to be weak. Idle capacity is in the range of 10 to                   40 percent. Inventory levels are low, and most contacts were                   satisfied with current levels. Due to increases in some input                   prices including natural gas, electricity, and ferrous metals,                   steel prices have climbed as well for some contacts. New orders                   are coming at a very slow rate and are flat for most contacts.                   Contacts generally anticipate flat to moderately rising production                   and sales through the rest of 2003.
Auto dealers indicated that September sales                   were poor, much lower than August and September 2002. Used vehicles                   continued to sell well, as did new trucks. Dealer inventories                   have risen and become somewhat "bloated" because of soft sales                   and increased shipments from manufacturers attempting to reduce                   their own inventories as the model-year ends.
Commercial construction was slow during this                   period, and increases noted in the last report appear to have                   been transitory. Conditions have not changed much from the early                   summer. However, most contacts continue to be optimistic about                   future contracts, as discussions about projects have picked                   up and appear to be less tentative than in the past. Several                   contacts noted new project possibilities in manufacturing areas.                   Profit margins continue to be low because of fierce competition                   for the available construction opportunities. A few contacts                   noted slight increases in materials costs.
