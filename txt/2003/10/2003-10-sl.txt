Contacts in the Eighth District indicate                 that the region's economy is showing modest signs of improvement.                 Favorable reports in the manufacturing and services industries                 suggest that economic activity increased since the last survey,                 although announcements of plant closings, downsizing, and layoffs                 remain. Retail sales increased in September compared with 2002                 levels, but auto sales declined over the same period. Home sales                 rose in most of the District in August, while commercial real                 estate markets remained weak. Loan demand increased over the past                 three months at a sample of small and mid-sized banks in the District.
The Eighth District's manufacturing sector appears to be expanding.                 Reports of plant openings, product-line expansions, increased                 spending on research and marketing, and new jobs created continued                 to appear since the last survey. Manufacturers in the automobile                 and automotive parts, motor, fuel processing, hand tools, sealing                 products, photography, food, clothing, medical devices, health,                 and beauty industries were among those who announced such moves.                 In the services sector, firms in the banking, communications,                 entertainment, and hotel industries announced improvement in business                 activity and plans for expansion. Despite the positive outlook,                 there have also been several announcements of plant closings,                 downsizing, and layoffs. Affected industries include utilities,                 electrical transformers, packaging, shipping and transportation,                 chemicals, hardware, plumbing, brass, steel, fabrics, furniture,                 food, and airlines. A troubled auto plant has received state aid                 to limit local job cuts. Firms in the food, health care, and beauty                 industries recently were granted tax freezes for several years                 in return for job creation in the District.
General retail sales in the District improved                 slightly in September compared with the same month last year,                 with several retailers reporting increased in-store traffic. Strong-selling                 products included clothing, appliances, discount items, furniture,                 and back-to-school items. Among the products that were not moving                 were seasonal merchandise and cookware. Auto dealers report that                 sales have increased slightly in recent weeks, but they are still                 below 2002 levels. They attribute this increase to a higher use                 of rebates, deep discounting, and better finance terms. Contacts                 report, however, that they will offer fewer incentives on 2004                 models. Recent sales of imports, SUVs, trucks, and used cars have                 increased, while sales of domestic, passenger, and new cars have                 decreased. Several contacts report that their inventories are                 higher than desired, particularly for used cars. Both general                 retailers and car dealers appear optimistic that sales will improve                 over the rest of the year.
Sales of single-family homes through August continued to increase                 in most of the District. August year-to-date sales in northern                 Kentucky increased by 18.0 percent compared with those in the                 same month last year. In the Memphis area, year-to-date sales                 increased by 9.7 percent, with an increase of 6.1 percent between                 July and August 2003. In the northeast Mississippi area, however,                 the stock of homes for sale was at historic highs. In August,                 year-to-date single-family housing permits were up in most of                 the District's metropolitan areas compared with August of last                 year. In the greater St. Louis area year-to-date permit levels                 increased by 1.0 percent. Housing starts were up in southern Indiana                 and northeast Arkansas. Residential construction was also strong                 in western Tennessee and northeast Arkansas.
The office and industrial real estate markets                 are still sluggish in most of the District. Contacts in the St.                 Louis area anticipate a slight decrease in office and industrial                 vacancy rates in the third quarter. Commercial construction activity                 is slowly improving in most of the District. New shopping malls                 and movie theaters are being built in central Kentucky, and contacts                 in southern Indiana and the Memphis area report that commercial                 construction is improving.
Total loans outstanding for a sample of small and mid-sized District                 banks were up 3.5 percent between early July and early September.                 This increase stemmed mostly from real estate loans and leases,                 which increased by 4.9 percent. Loans to individuals increased                 by 1.9 percent, while loans to commercial banks decreased by 1.0                 percent. Over the same period, total deposits at these banks were                 up by 0.7 percent.
Recent weather has had mixed effects on agriculture. While rains                 slowed row crop maturity in some areas, damaged some tobacco during                 the harvest in Kentucky, and pushed back harvesting of hay and                 cotton, recent drier conditions have aided corn and soybean maturity                 and provided favorable conditions for quickening the harvest.                 Current reports indicate that, except for sorghum, the majority                 of crops lie in the good-to-excellent range. Improved by recent                 rains, more than 50 percent of pastures and hay also lie in this                 range.
Corn yields appear good, but harvesting is still                 behind its average pace. Soybean maturity and harvest lag nearly                 50 percent behind average in Illinois and Missouri, while they                 are at a better-than-average pace in Mississippi. Sorghum maturity                 and harvest are behind average by over 70 percent in Illinois.                 Cotton harvest lags by nearly 50 percent due to previous wet conditions,                 while hay and rice crops are roughly on schedule. Farmers are                 now beginning to plant winter wheat. The condition of livestock                 continues to be good, as are soil moisture levels.
