Contacts in the Eighth District indicate                 that the region's economy is showing modest signs of improvement.                 Favorable reports in the manufacturing and services industries                 suggest that economic activity increased since the last survey,                 although announcements of plant closings, downsizing, and layoffs                 remain. Retail sales increased in September compared with 2002                 levels, but auto sales declined over the same period. Home sales                 rose in most of the District in August, while commercial real                 estate markets remained weak. Loan demand increased over the past                 three months at a sample of small and mid-sized banks in the District.
General retail sales in the District improved                 slightly in September compared with the same month last year,                 with several retailers reporting increased in-store traffic. Strong-selling                 products included clothing, appliances, discount items, furniture,                 and back-to-school items. Among the products that were not moving                 were seasonal merchandise and cookware. Auto dealers report that                 sales have increased slightly in recent weeks, but they are still                 below 2002 levels. They attribute this increase to a higher use                 of rebates, deep discounting, and better finance terms. Contacts                 report, however, that they will offer fewer incentives on 2004                 models. Recent sales of imports, SUVs, trucks, and used cars have                 increased, while sales of domestic, passenger, and new cars have                 decreased. Several contacts report that their inventories are                 higher than desired, particularly for used cars. Both general                 retailers and car dealers appear optimistic that sales will improve                 over the rest of the year.
The office and industrial real estate markets                 are still sluggish in most of the District. Contacts in the St.                 Louis area anticipate a slight decrease in office and industrial                 vacancy rates in the third quarter. Commercial construction activity                 is slowly improving in most of the District. New shopping malls                 and movie theaters are being built in central Kentucky, and contacts                 in southern Indiana and the Memphis area report that commercial                 construction is improving.
Corn yields appear good, but harvesting is still                 behind its average pace. Soybean maturity and harvest lag nearly                 50 percent behind average in Illinois and Missouri, while they                 are at a better-than-average pace in Mississippi. Sorghum maturity                 and harvest are behind average by over 70 percent in Illinois.                 Cotton harvest lags by nearly 50 percent due to previous wet conditions,                 while hay and rice crops are roughly on schedule. Farmers are                 now beginning to plant winter wheat. The condition of livestock                 continues to be good, as are soil moisture levels.
