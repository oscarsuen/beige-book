Reports from Twelfth District contacts                 indicated some further pickup in economic growth in September.                 Despite continued increases in demand, many respondents indicated                 that strong competitive pressures continued to hold down prices                 and that productivity gains continued to keep hiring at bay. Retailers                 reported that sales continued to improve and service providers                 noted a further pickup in the demand for travel, software, and                 media services. Reports indicated that overall manufacturing activity                 continued to rise; orders strengthened for manufacturers of semiconductors,                 apparel, and lumber and wood products. Conditions for District                 agricultural and resource-related products were robust in recent                 weeks. Respondents indicated that the demand for homes remained                 strong, while the demand for commercial real estate remained sluggish.                 Banking contacts reported an increase in business loan originations                 in several District markets; however, mortgage refinancing activity                 continued to contract in recent weeks.

Although demand for many goods and services                 have increased in the District, employment conditions have continued                 to languish. A majority of District respondents reported no immediate                 plans to increase hiring, although some are optimistic that they                 will start hiring in a couple of quarters. For instance, District                 retailers, service providers, and banks have relied heavily on                 employee overtime and improved efficiency to meet increased demand.                 District manufacturers have used productivity gains and increased                 outsourcing to meet demand. In agriculture, producers have replaced                 some workers with machines for harvesting.
Demand in the District for other services strengthened                 further in September, particularly for IT and media services.                 Respondents indicated that this could be explained partly by a                 pickup in demand for efficiency-enhancing technologies. Also,                 contacts reported a pickup in demand in food and restaurant industries.
Conditions in the District's travel and tourism                 sectors improved further in September and early October. In Hawaii,                 international visitor counts have begun to increase after having                 been battered by fear of SARS and the war. Domestic visitor counts                 continued to be strong. Hotel occupancy rates have inched up in                 several District markets. On the down side, convention bookings                 have yet to pick up in Utah, and several airlines continue to                 face excess capacity.
On the downside, makers of telecommunications                 equipment and commercial aircraft continued to face overcapacity                 and weak orders and sales. Demand for machine tools and basic                 metals softened slightly relative to robust activity during the                 last survey period.


Mortgage refinance activity declined further                 across the District, with no signs of pickup despite a slight                 decrease in interest rates during the survey period. Origination                 of new mortgages for home purchases remained strong, although                 District bank contacts observed signs of moderation in some markets.
