Despite disruptions from Hurricane Isabel, economic                 growth advanced at a modest pace in the Fifth District in late                 August and September as ongoing moderate expansion in the services                 sector was partially offset by continued contraction in the manufacturing                 sector. Hurricane Isabel disrupted retail and services businesses                 in several District states in mid-to-late September, although                 relatively few establishments outside of coastal regions experienced                 significant property damage. Along the coast, tourists were on                 the move in advance of Isabel's arrival on September 18, but decreases                 in tourism activity in those areas were partly offset by increases                 at inland locations as tourists relocated and out-of-region utility                 crews arrived for repair and clean-up efforts. With the exception                 of hurricane-related purchases, such as generators, plywood, and                 batteries, retail sales were generally flat in September. District                 manufacturing activity weakened since our last report as shipments                 declined again and employment at factories contracted. Adding                 to the weaker tone, a small number of manufacturers reported prolonged                 shutdowns and/or substantial damage resulting from the hurricane.                 In the housing sector, growth in home sales slowed, but realtors                 said that activity remained at a high level. In agriculture and                 fishing, heavy rain and high winds from the hurricane damaged                 fishing boats and crops and disrupted the feeding of livestock                 in areas lying in the storm's path.
Hurricane Isabel caused relatively few disruptions                 to manufacturing operations, though adverse impacts were noted                 by some District lumber mills. A contact at a North Carolina lumber                 mill told us that their plant shut down for several days and noted                 that there would be much lower volumes of standing timber available                 for sale for years to come. On a brighter note, a counterpart                 at a Virginia lumber mill said that while his company's orders                 had dropped because of the storm he felt that there would be a                 surge in business after roads were cleared and power was restored                 to the area.
District realtors reported no major changes                 in commercial real estate conditions in recent weeks. While there                 continued to be pockets of improvement, contacts said that the                 lack of job growth had made many companies cautious and hesitant                 to commit to new projects. By sector, the leasing of retail space                 remained steady in most markets, while activity continued to be                 flat in office and industrial space. Commercial rents dipped and                 vacancies held firm. Commercial construction activity continued                 to be "very slow." Looking ahead, realtors expected stronger growth                 in the fourth quarter--a contact in Columbia, S.C., said he was                 "cautiously optimistic" regarding activity for the remainder of                 the year.
