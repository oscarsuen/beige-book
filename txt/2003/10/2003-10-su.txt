Information received from District Banks suggests               that, on balance, the pace of economic expansion has picked up since               the last report. Ten of the twelve districts indicate that activity               has been expanding, while two--Boston and Cleveland--report mixed               but steady levels of economic activity. Overall, both wages and               prices of finished goods and services remained relatively stable,               though there were scattered reports of business input cost pressures.               Hurricane Isabel inflicted some limited damage across much of the               Richmond District, but the disruptions to activity from the storm               were said to be short-lived.
Consumer spending generally strengthened, though               most districts report a recent pullback in auto sales. Improving               sales trends are reported in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St.               Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Retail               inventories are generally described to be at or close to desired               levels, and retailers generally anticipate modest year-over-year               gains for the upcoming holiday season. Most districts report strengthening               in manufacturing activity. Employment in this sector remained generally               weak, though some districts note pockets of firming.
Broad-based strength is reported in residential               real estate and construction, but commercial real estate markets               are still described as sluggish. Travel and tourism activity was               mixed but, on balance, showed some improvement. Reports from most               other service industries also show improvement.
Banks in almost all districts report a substantial               drop-off in refinancing activity since the last report, though there               were a few reports of improvement toward the end of September. There               was some pickup in business loan demand, while home mortgage and               consumer lending were mixed. Credit quality was generally described               as good, with only scattered reports of increased delinquency rates.               Most districts report favorable weather conditions and improved               agriculture yields since the last report, though Richmond reports               significant crop damage from Hurricane Isabel.
Labor markets generally remain slack, but some               signs of a pickup are reported in New York, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis,               and Dallas. Prices of finished goods were generally stable, and               wage increases continued to be quite modest, though many districts               note continued escalation of non-wage benefit costs--particularly               health insurance. Also, fairly sharp price increases are reported               for cattle and certain commodities, such as steel, lumber, plywood,               and natural gas.
Recent reductions in motor vehicle sales are reported               in most districts. Automobile sales are said to have weakened in               the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City, Dallas,               and San Francisco Districts. St. Louis, on the other hand, reports               some improvement in vehicle sales in recent weeks, though they were               still lower than a year ago. Also, sales of imports are said to               be holding up better than those of domestic makes in the St. Louis,               and San Francisco Districts.
Non-auto inventories are generally reported to               be in good shape in almost all districts, but vehicle inventories               are said to be higher than desired in Cleveland, Chicago, and St.               Louis. Looking ahead to the rest of 2003, retailers in most districts               are reported to be cautiously optimistic. Modest sales growth is               anticipated in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta,               St. Louis, and Kansas City, while the remaining districts did not               specify sales expectations.
Manufacturing employment exhibited modest gains               in some districts, but in most was stable or declining. The Kansas               City, Cleveland, and New York Districts report increases in hours               worked, and Kansas City, New York, and St. Louis report hiring gains.               Capital spending activity was mixed, with contacts in several districts               reporting plans to increase capital spending, while the majority               of contacts from other districts cite hesitation and lackluster               spending plans going forward.
Residential construction is also indicated to               be strong in most districts. Recent increases in construction activity               are reported in New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Kansas               City notes that builders have had trouble obtaining plywood, while               reports from Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and San Francisco               indicate sharp increases in lumber and plywood costs, which, in               turn, are said to be squeezing builders' profit margins.
Commercial real estate markets, in contrast, continue               to be characterized as weak in almost all districts. Still, a number               of districts indicate slight signs of firming since the last report--specifically               New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas.               On the other hand, renewed signs of slowing are reported from Chicago               and Minneapolis, while conditions are described as stagnant in Richmond               and San Francisco.
Business conditions in other service industry               sectors varied but generally improved. Increased demand for various               business-related services (such as legal, accounting, IT, and executive               search) is noted in Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco.               Increases in trucking are reported in Cleveland, while Dallas indicates               a decrease in trucking volume but an increase in rail shipments,               and New York reports strong increases in port traffic. Boston reports               mixed to firmer conditions in the insurance industry, with industry               contacts reporting little financial impact from the August blackout               and expressing optimism about the business outlook.
Loan quality is generally described as good, with               delinquency rates little changed since the last report. Chicago               and Dallas report some improvement in loan quality and Atlanta says               that loan delinquencies "remained manageable," while Philadelphia               cites an increase in debt-service to income ratios, and New York               indicates an uptick in delinquencies on consumer and home mortgage               loans.
Aside from lending, financial institutions report               favorable conditions and brisk growth. New York's securities industry               reports strong growth in revenue, profits and compensation. Similarly,               financial institutions in the Dallas District report a pickup in               mergers and acquisition activity, leading to higher fee income.               Finally, San Francisco suggests that a recent acceleration in business               deposit in-flows further reflects a pickup in general economic activity.
Activity in the energy industry was mixed. The               Minneapolis District indicates a slight decline in oil and natural               gas exploration levels since the last report, while the Kansas City               District reports a moderate expansion in oil and gas drilling. The               Dallas District reports that activity remained at a relatively high               level, but was not quite as strong as might be expected given the               current price of oil and natural gas.
Modest wage growth is reported across the nation,               though continued escalation in non-wage benefits, particularly health               insurance, are noted in Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City,               Dallas, and San Francisco. Rising benefit costs are said to be holding               down wage increases in the Atlanta District and deterring hiring               in Dallas.
The various districts report little change in prices               of consumer goods and services, but steep escalation in certain               commodity prices. Retail prices are reported to be stable in Cleveland,               Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco; steady to slightly higher in               Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Kansas City; and steady to slightly               lower in Boston, New York, and Dallas.
In contrast with the general price stability for               finished goods and services, prices for a number of commodities               have risen sharply. Steep increases in lumber and plywood costs               are noted in Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City,               and San Francisco--some of this is attributed to post-war rebuilding               in Iraq, post-hurricane repairs along the Mid-Atlantic seaboard,               and fires in the West that affected supply. There were also reports               of steep price increases for cattle, steel, and natural gas. However,               oil and gasoline prices have retreated, following a sharp run-up               in August. In terms of intermediate services, a noticeable increase               in freight costs is reported in the Minneapolis District, but declines               in commercial rents are seen in Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis.
