The Tenth District economy continued                   to expand in late August and September. Manufacturing strengthened                   further, and more firms than in previous surveys reported increased                   hiring and investment. Retail sales excluding autos rose slightly,                   housing activity remained strong, and the farm and energy sectors                   improved. On the other hand, auto sales fell after rising earlier                   in the summer. Commercial real estate markets also remained                   weak, although they showed some signs of stabilizing. Wage and                   price increases were generally modest, but some materials prices                   rose sharply.
