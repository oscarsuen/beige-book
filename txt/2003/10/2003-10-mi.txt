Overall Ninth District economic activity                 increased in late August and September. Residential real estate,                 manufacturing, agriculture, consumer spending and mining grew.                 Meanwhile, tourism was mixed, and commercial real estate and energy                 were down slightly. Labor markets were soft. Wage and price increases                 were generally moderate; however, significant price increases                 were noted in natural gas, freight and health insurance, with                 decreases in gasoline.
Home building and residential real estate activity                 grew. Housing units authorized in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area                 were up 15 percent in September compared with last year. The number                 of closed home sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area was 25 percent                 higher in August compared with a year ago, while the median home                 sale price increased 9 percent. A Montana bank director reported                 that real estate sales and prices have been up steadily in the                 Bozeman area, with no immediate signs of a slowdown. Another bank                 director noted that refinancing activity dropped significantly                 during early September in southwestern Wisconsin, but signs of                 recovery were seen by the end of the month.
Auto sales were slower in September compared                 with July and August. Showroom traffic was slow in September,                 and truck orders were down in rural areas, according to an auto                 dealers association representative in Minnesota.
Tourism activity was mixed. Visits to Glacier                 National Park were down significantly due to fires, while August                 visits to Yellowstone National Park increased compared with July.                 A bank director reported strong bookings for fall conferences                 and the ski season at hotels in the Bozeman, Montana, area. Tourism                 conditions were mixed among attractions in Minnesota, according                 to a tourism official; summer tourism picked up in August relative                 to a slow start earlier in the summer. In South Dakota visits                 to Mount Rushmore increased about 5 percent in August compared                 with a year ago.
In contrast, a mine opening in Montana will                 likely create 400 jobs by year end. A temporary staffing agency                 survey showed that 32 percent of employers in Minneapolis-St.                 Paul expect to hire more workers during the fourth quarter and                 13 percent expect to reduce payrolls. Last year 23 percent expected                 to increase payrolls; 11 percent planned reductions. Initial claims                 for unemployment insurance in Minnesota decreased 8 percent in                 August compared with a year ago.
Increases in wages and salaries were moderate.                 For example, a teachers union in Minnesota recently agreed to                 an average salary increase of 2.5 percent the first year and 1.2                 percent the second year of a two-year contract.
Price increases were generally moderate, with                 significant increases noted in health insurance, natural gas and                 freight, while gasoline prices were down. Several members of the                 Advisory Council on Small Business and Labor mentioned that overall                 price increases were minimal, while health insurance rates increased                 well over 10 percent in 2003, compared with last year. Natural                 gas prices were recently 15 percent above last year's levels;                 double-digit increases on fuel bills are expected this winter.                 An owner of a trucking company in Montana reported that recent                 freight rates were notably higher than a year ago. Gasoline prices                 in Minnesota decreased 21 cents from mid-September to the end                 of the month.
