Business conditions in the Third District improved slightly in September.  Manufacturers reported increases in orders and shipments for the month.  Retail sales of general merchandise in September were up slightly from August and from September a year ago.  Auto and light truck sales eased in September from August but were up somewhat on a year-over-year basis.  Bank lending has been rising, with advances in business, consumer, and residential mortgage lending.  Business at service firms has begun to show some improvement, although the gain has been slight.
The consensus forecast in the Third District business community is for slowly improving conditions.  Manufacturers forecast increases in shipments and orders during the next six months.  Most of the retailers surveyed in September expect sales in the fourth quarter of this year to exceed sales in the fourth quarter of last year, and some store executives have recently raised their forecasts.  Auto dealers anticipate steady sales.  Bankers expect continued slow growth in lending.  Service companies expect some growth, but in general they anticipate only slight gains in the next two quarters.
Looking ahead, manufacturers in the region expect                 further improvement. More than two-thirds of the firms contacted                 for this report expect increases in shipments and orders, and                 virtually none expect decreases during the next six months. Around                 one-third of the manufacturers surveyed in September have recently                 increased planned production for the fourth quarter compared with                 plans made earlier this year, and only one in ten have trimmed                 production schedules for the quarter. More area manufacturers                 plan to increase rather than reduce capital expenditures in the                 next six months, but not by a large margin.
Third District retailers expect sales in the                 final quarter of this year to exceed the same period a year ago,                 and some have recently raised their forecasts. Merchants believe                 consumer confidence is building slowly and that shoppers will                 begin to make purchases that they have been postponing. Nevertheless,                 in a continuing effort to contain costs, many stores are limiting                 their inventories and implementing measures to reduce order cycle                 times.
Auto dealers reported an easing in the sales                 rate in September after very strong August sales. Compared with                 a year ago sales in September were up slightly. In general, dealers                 indicated that inventories were at appropriate levels, but some                 dealers said they still had 2003 models that they were trying                 to clear out. Dealers expect sales to run at a roughly steady                 rate during the rest of the year.
Bankers in the District expect continued slow                 growth in lending through the rest of the year. Some said growth                 in business and personal loans could accelerate somewhat next                 year if the pace of business activity in the region quickens.                 Most of the lending officers surveyed in September expect lending                 for home purchase mortgages to continue to increase in tandem                 with any increase in home sales in the region, but they anticipate                 further declines in refinancings. In general, bankers in the District                 indicated that credit quality for both personal and business loans                 has been steady, but some noted that debt service to income ratios                 have risen for both individual and business borrowers.
Stock brokers and investment management companies                 indicated that cash flows into most types of funds and financial                 instruments were steady in September. Executives of the nondepository                 financial firms contacted for this report said investors are still                 concerned about fundamental economic conditions. They do not expect                 investment activity to pick up significantly until employment                 begins to move up consistently.
