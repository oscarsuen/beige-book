Seventh District economic activity continued                 to show signs of modest improvement in late August and September.                 However, many businesses wanted to see a longer period of firming                 in demand before committing to hiring, expanding capacity, or                 inventory building. Consumer spending was stronger than earlier                 in the year, but sales results were mixed by retail segment. Business                 attitudes appeared to improve further, yet spending and hiring                 plans remained cautious. Construction and real estate activities                 continued to be characterized by strong residential markets and                 weak commercial markets. Manufacturing activity continued to expand.                 Bank lending remained relatively soft. There were only small changes                 in the price and cost environments. Early harvest results suggest                 that corn output will be at least average, but that soybean output                 will be well below average.
