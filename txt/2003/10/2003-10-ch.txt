Seventh District economic activity continued                 to show signs of modest improvement in late August and September.                 However, many businesses wanted to see a longer period of firming                 in demand before committing to hiring, expanding capacity, or                 inventory building. Consumer spending was stronger than earlier                 in the year, but sales results were mixed by retail segment. Business                 attitudes appeared to improve further, yet spending and hiring                 plans remained cautious. Construction and real estate activities                 continued to be characterized by strong residential markets and                 weak commercial markets. Manufacturing activity continued to expand.                 Bank lending remained relatively soft. There were only small changes                 in the price and cost environments. Early harvest results suggest                 that corn output will be at least average, but that soybean output                 will be well below average.
Consumer spending in August and September still appeared to be                 stronger than earlier in the year, although reports were mixed.                 Retailers said that sales generally exceeded expectations, as                 consumers continued to purchase deeply discounted merchandise.                 Inventories were leaner than expected as a result. Still, most                 merchants were not confident enough about sales prospects to boost                 inventories in the near term. While apparel sales generally remained                 sluggish, there was a sharp rise in sales of baseball-related                 apparel in the Chicago area. By contrast, a contact in casual                 dining indicated that food service sales remained soft. District                 auto dealers said that light vehicle sales fell from August to                 September, and seemed softer than the national trend in both months.                 With weaker sales, dealers continued to curb light vehicle orders                 and draw down inventories. Many dealers also noted that service                 sales slowed in September after picking up toward the end of summer.
Business attitudes continued to improve, although spending and                 hiring plans remained cautious. Several contacts noted that businesses                 were seeing better earnings, but much of the improvement resulted                 from cost containment rather than revenue gains. One contact suggested                 that firms want to see several periods of stronger revenue growth                 "in their rearview mirrors" before they commit to capacity expansion                 and permanent hiring. Most capital equipment spending continued                 to go toward the maintenance, repair, or replacement of existing                 stock. On the hiring side, contacts with temporary help firms                 reported a seasonal pickup in worker orders; for one national                 firm, this was the first seasonal boost in three years. The jump                 in worker assignments was particularly evident in the light industrial                 and office/clerical categories. Several contacts suggested that                 the bulk of new temporary hiring was done by small employers rather                 than large. Still, most businesses remained very reluctant to                 add permanent full-time help, although there were a few reports                 of increasing worker hours.
As has been true for some time now, District real estate markets                 were strong on the residential side and weak on the commercial                 side. New home sales were again robust, with one contact's comment                 that "business is great" generally summing up builders' sentiment.                 Sales of first-time-buyer and trade-up homes continued to drive                 the market, although there were a few reports of a pickup in the                 luxury segment. Traffic through builders' annual "Fall Parade                 of Homes" was very high in most areas, leaving builders more optimistic                 that new home sales will remain strong well into the fall. Existing                 home sales were also very strong in most parts of the District.                 Commercial activities appeared to slow somewhat. Some contacts                 said that the number of office property tours and prospects fell                 recently, after picking up through the summer. On balance, office                 vacancy rates were flat in the third quarter, and rents remained                 under downward pressure. Light industrial vacancies remained elevated                 and there were some concerns that big-box retail space was overdeveloped.
Manufacturing activity continued to expand in late August and                 September. Nationally, light vehicle demand exceeded some automakers'                 expectations over the summer months, which helped bring inventories                 down to desired levels sooner than anticipated. Despite stronger                 sales, automakers did not report any changes to production schedules.                 A leading producer of home appliances said that shipments picked                 up in recent months as distributors replenished depleted inventories.                 Some heavy equipment industries were seeing a "pretty good recovery,"                 according to one contact, and even though inventories were rising,                 the inventory-to-sales ratio continued to decline. Medium-duty                 truck dealers were also said to be rebuilding inventories, helping                 to boost shipments in September. Some producers of machine tools                 noted increases in price quotes, new orders, and shipments. Moreover,                 one contact suggested that the increase in demand for machine                 tools was coming from customers across a wider range of industries.                 Despite little change in demand, domestic steel production improved                 modestly as imports continued to fall.
Overall lending activity remained relatively soft, although bankers                 reported slight increases in both household and business loan                 demand. Residential refinancing activity increased somewhat from                 its summer lull, but remained well below the peak reached in June.                 One banker said that margins on mortgage loans were being squeezed                 as firms that had built up "a huge mortgage lending infrastructure"                 competed for a smaller pool of potential borrowers. Some contacts                 also noted modest increases in home equity and credit card volumes.                 Household loan quality was reported to be largely unchanged. Business                 loan demand remained very soft on balance, though there were scattered                 reports of improvement in some segments. A few bankers noted increased                 lending to small businesses, and one saw a pickup in middle-market                 lending. For the most part though, large corporate borrowers remained                 on the sidelines. Business credit quality was said to be improving,                 and there were no changes reported for standards and terms.
On balance, there was little change in the pricing and cost environments.                 Manufacturers of some products said that a weaker dollar enabled                 them to raise output prices from very low levels. However, producers                 of other goods attempted to push through price increases with                 limited success. Many retailers indicated that the long trend                 toward steeper discounts may be coming to an end, with one adding                 that "prices simply can't go much lower." Business contacts continued                 to report that higher energy and insurance costs were squeezing                 profits. To keep the rise in employment costs down, more employers                 were planning to shift higher health insurance premiums to their                 workers. In addition, several contacts reported that firms continued                 to limit and/or delay merit pay increases.
Crop conditions generally stabilized during September after deteriorating                 during August due to heat and lack of precipitation. In eastern                 portions of the District, however, harvesting was running behind                 average since fields were too wet and crops were maturing late.                 Corn yields across the District were coming in close to normal                 or above, but soybean yields were mostly below normal. Widespread                 spraying for aphids kept soybean yields from falling more, but                 boosted input costs. On balance, expectations for farm income                 have been reduced, potentially stressing farmers' cash flows and                 thus generating concerns about loan repayments. As a result, slower                 capital expenditures in farming are expected for the District,                 except for repairs. Nonetheless, strong competition between farmers                 and nonfarm investors persisted, driving farmland values and rental                 rates higher. With less development in some areas, there are signs                 that the role of tax-deferred exchanges in pushing up land values                 has begun to slow.
