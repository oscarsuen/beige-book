Reports from Seventh District contacts generally suggested that economic activity   remained soft in January and February. Consumer spending was again relatively   weak, and caution persisted in businesses' capital spending and hiring plans.   Strength continued in sales of both new and existing homes, while nonresidential   building and real estate activities were again soft. Manufacturing activity   remained generally weak but appeared to have improved further from our last   report. Bankers continued to report strong mortgage demand from households and   weak loan demand from businesses. There were a few new reports of input cost   increases, particularly for energy, but prices at the retail level remained   largely in check. District farmland values in 2002 posted the largest year-over-year   gain since 1997, even as concerns increased about the impact of drought and   continued low dairy prices.
