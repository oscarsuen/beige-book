From early January through mid-February, overall Eleventh District economic   activity exhibited signs of inertia. Manufacturing activity remained lackluster.   Service sector activity was mixed, with signs of a pickup in some industries   and severe financial problems in others. Retail sales remain weak, and there   is still little change in the financial services industry. Construction and   real estate markets continued to decline. Energy activity picked up only mildly,   despite a sharp increase in prices. Overall agricultural conditions were good.
Geopolitical uncertainties still dampen consumer and business confidence. High   energy prices also weigh heavily on the outlook for some industries. Hiring   is minimal, according to contacts who say investments are on hold until questions   surrounding the war are resolved. Contacts report that concerns about terrorism   seem to be distracting attention from normal business.
Cold weather and rising crude oil prices also pushed natural gas prices upward.   Several waves of bitter weather have pulled natural gas inventories down 20   percent below year-earlier levels, and raised concerns about their adequacy   to deal with a late winter blast of cold weather. Propane prices have risen   along with natural gas--reaching the highest level in 13 years. Higher energy   prices have pushed up chemical and plastic prices. Healthy demand for housing   is driving price increases for chlorine and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
Rising cost pressures--particularly from energy, shipping, and insurance--were   noted by most industries. A few firms were able to pass along price increases,   but international competition and overcapacity is making that difficult for   most manufacturers and retailers. Some contacts suggest that energy price increases   will be passed onto consumers if they persist. A few firms expressed concern   about how long they could operate if energy costs remain elevated.
Demand for fabricated metals was flat in January and February, and producers   were guarded about the outlook for activity over the next year. Sales of primary   metals picked up in January but then fell in February. Producers say that sales   are slower than a year ago. Metals producers reported some increases in selling   prices, partially passing along rising costs for scrap metal and reinforcing   steel. Producers of stone, clay, and glass were surprised by better-than-expected   demand over the past two months, but expressed increased uncertainty about the   outlook. Paper and lumber producers report soft sales during the same period,   partly because of import competition. Paper producers expect little change in   sales growth because international competitors are absorbing market share, especially   China.
Demand for apparel products is up. Production of private label apparel is increasing,   according to contacts who say that selling prices continue to decline, even   as energy prices are pushing up production costs of petroleum based fabrics.
The high-tech industry reported a slight pickup in sales since the last survey.   One source of moderate improvement has been increasing orders from businesses   for replacement hardware such as routers, computers, and monitors. One respondent   noted that this might be the beginning of a replacement cycle; businesses remain   conservative, but after so little spending in the past couple of years, feel   the need to replace old equipment. Consumers continue to buy video and computer   gaming systems and products, and there has been a pickup in demand for high-definition   TVs and flash memory. Inventories remain very low. There is still too much capacity   in the telecommunications industry, although there has been some pickup in demand   for mobile phones and other consumer products. Contacts say the recent FCC decision   has delayed a potential stimulus for capital investment in the industry, dampening   the outlook for telecommunication equipment firms.
Refinery utilization on the Gulf Coast, which was running at about 95 percent   in early December, fell to the mid-80 percent level as Venezuelan crude oil   shipments were disrupted. Utilization improved slowly in early February. There   have been sharp reductions in both crude and product inventories, with crude   inventories 25 percent below last year and near critical levels needed to maintain   normal operation of the refinery system.
Demand for petrochemicals has been generally weak over the past two months,   but is still up 5 percent to 6 percent above last year. One exception is PVC,   where demand has been very strong to supply the housing market and Asia.
Demand for legal services remains steady, particularly for litigation, bankruptcy,   labor, and regulatory work. Real estate and lending activity are still quiet,   but there are some signs of a pickup for transactional and venture capital activity.   Legal contacts say activity will remain flat to moderate until corporate confidence   improves. Demand for accounting and consulting activity remains solid, partly   because firms continue to benefit from the Anderson fallout. The Sarbanes-Oxley   bill is boosting demand for risk management and audit work.
Many small businesses are struggling, particularly those that supply the high-tech   industry, and contacts say there is a huge shake out going on. One company is   requiring cash up front for new business because they have depleted all reserves.   This firm said they are reinventing their company regularly to find new ways   to support their customers.
The airline industry remains in a tailspin. Demand for air travel continues   to be extremely price sensitive, and already strapped carriers are having difficulty   passing higher fuel costs on to passengers. The snowstorm on the East Coast   added another financial blow. A significant drop in aircraft values has tightened   the availability of credit for airlines.
