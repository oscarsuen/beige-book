The First District economy shows few signs of improvement. Retailers cite disappointing   December results, although some gained in January and February. Most manufacturing   contacts report weak demand. Commercial real estate markets in New England remain   very slow. Most software and information technology providers say demand is   declining. The outlook is highly uncertain and virtually no contacts are making   plans based on expectations of an upturn.
Most retailers are holding employment levels steady; two contacts, however,   are implementing slight decreases in head count. Wages are mostly constant,   although Maine's minimum wage increase has led to some raises even in above-minimum   pay rates. Most capital spending plans continue to be minimal. Overall, vendor   prices and selling prices are level or falling.
Some retail contacts expect sales to increase slightly over the next six months,   while others foresee little improvement. Most contacts are hopeful for a turnaround   if the geopolitical uncertainties are resolved in the next six months.
Selling prices remain under competitive pressure. Although materials costs   are generally in check, contacts express concern that rising oil prices will   raise costs for items such as plastics and chemicals.
About one-half of the manufacturing contacts expect to shrink their workforce   in coming months. Most of the remaining firms are either holding staffing steady   following layoffs in recent months or hiring selectively. In 2003 merit pay   increases are or will be modest, ranging from zero percent to 4 percent at most   firms. Capital spending budgets for 2003 generally are similar to last year's.   The few companies planning significant increases cite the need for efficiency   improvements or new product development.
Most manufacturers are either anticipating or hoping for a modest improvement   in conditions during 2003. However, they remain cautious in the face of economic   and geopolitical uncertainties. Contacts variously describe their companies   as "focusing inward" ? "not spending with confidence, not taking a lot of chances"   ? "just muddling along" ? "[having] absolutely no visibility right now."
Software producers seeing revenue gains continue to add labor. The rest are   still adding no jobs, with some firms having reached optimal size and others   beginning to struggle to avoid layoffs. Capital spending is level across the   sector with few plans for change in the coming months. Companies continue to   spend only out of necessity or to complete previously postponed investment projects.
Software and information technology contacts indicate that                   the outlook has deteriorated since the last quarter of 2002                   and is marked by considerable uncertainty. The majority of respondents                   expect flat to deteriorating demand for the next quarter, partly                   reflecting increased geopolitical risk.
