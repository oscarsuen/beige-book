The First District economy shows few signs of improvement. Retailers cite disappointing   December results, although some gained in January and February. Most manufacturing   contacts report weak demand. Commercial real estate markets in New England remain   very slow. Most software and information technology providers say demand is   declining. The outlook is highly uncertain and virtually no contacts are making   plans based on expectations of an upturn.
Most retail contacts in New England report lackluster sales in December, although   some contacts report a slight uptick in January and February. Art and graphics   supplies reportedly sold well, while electronics sales slowed and inventories   rose. Conditions in the travel and tourism sector remain weak; contacts report   hotel occupancy rates in the Boston area continue to be low because of soft   corporate and international travel. Furniture sales did not meet expectations   in December, but reportedly picked up in January and February. A surplus merchandise   contact experienced record-high sales in December, having obtained unusually   good inventory from big retailers. Hardware stores report double-digit increases   in sales compared with a year ago; the harsh weather and fear of terrorism--consumers   purchasing items such as duct tape and plastic--have helped boost sales.
Most retailers are holding employment levels steady; two contacts, however,   are implementing slight decreases in head count. Wages are mostly constant,   although Maine's minimum wage increase has led to some raises even in above-minimum   pay rates. Most capital spending plans continue to be minimal. Overall, vendor   prices and selling prices are level or falling.
Some retail contacts expect sales to increase slightly over the next six months,   while others foresee little improvement. Most contacts are hopeful for a turnaround   if the geopolitical uncertainties are resolved in the next six months.
First District manufacturing contacts continue to report few, if any, signs   of a pickup in demand for their products in early 2003. Most makers of capital   goods and other business products indicate that business is weak, especially   for aircraft and power equipment. Makers of consumer products say business is   soft or, at best, just meeting plan. Some consumer goods companies indicate   new signs of deterioration. For example, one furniture company observes that   consumers became more cautious in early February and a label maker says that   sales to retailers have been running below expectations in the new year. However,   others say that conditions are basically similar to what they observed in late   2002 or even a little better. In contrast to the general trend, sales of supplies   and equipment to health-related sectors continue to rise. Contacts in the semiconductor   industry anticipate that first-quarter revenues will be up at a double-digit   rate from a year ago; however, one firm is continuing to see good momentum quarter   to quarter, while another calls the quarterly pattern "flattish."
Selling prices remain under competitive pressure. Although materials costs   are generally in check, contacts express concern that rising oil prices will   raise costs for items such as plastics and chemicals.
About one-half of the manufacturing contacts expect to shrink their workforce   in coming months. Most of the remaining firms are either holding staffing steady   following layoffs in recent months or hiring selectively. In 2003 merit pay   increases are or will be modest, ranging from zero percent to 4 percent at most   firms. Capital spending budgets for 2003 generally are similar to last year's.   The few companies planning significant increases cite the need for efficiency   improvements or new product development.
Most manufacturers are either anticipating or hoping for a modest improvement   in conditions during 2003. However, they remain cautious in the face of economic   and geopolitical uncertainties. Contacts variously describe their companies   as "focusing inward" ? "not spending with confidence, not taking a lot of chances"   ? "just muddling along" ? "[having] absolutely no visibility right now."
Conditions in the staffing industry are mixed, with most companies experiencing   flat or modest year-over-year growth in revenues and profits during the fourth   quarter of 2002 and early 2003. Labor supply remains abundant. Wages and billing   rates are largely unchanged, although many respondents express alarm at steady   increases in employee insurance costs. Temp hiring in manufacturing and light   industry is particularly weak, with Vermont reportedly lagging behind the other   New England states. Staffing firms are keeping their own payroll and capital   spending low, with few instances of further restructuring or reorganization.   Most respondents anticipate modest growth in 2003, particularly during the second   half.
Commercial real estate markets in New England remain sluggish. Respondents report   little change in activity since our last contact in November, with any new leasing   activity being spurred predominantly by consolidation rather than by expansion   or growth. While demand for building purchases continues to be strong, lack   of demand for rental space has led to lower rental rates and higher vacancy   rates in office markets throughout the region. In the Boston area, the published   vacancy rates are around 15 percent in the city and 30 percent in the suburbs,   but substantially more space is actually available for rent, as some companies   make deals for space that is not even listed for sublease. Rental rates for   Class A space have dropped to what Class B or Class C buildings commanded two   years ago. With little expectation that the economy will improve in the near   future, contacts predict a third consecutive year of negative absorption.
Software producers seeing revenue gains continue to add labor. The rest are   still adding no jobs, with some firms having reached optimal size and others   beginning to struggle to avoid layoffs. Capital spending is level across the   sector with few plans for change in the coming months. Companies continue to   spend only out of necessity or to complete previously postponed investment projects.
Software and information technology contacts indicate that                   the outlook has deteriorated since the last quarter of 2002                   and is marked by considerable uncertainty. The majority of respondents                   expect flat to deteriorating demand for the next quarter, partly                   reflecting increased geopolitical risk.
