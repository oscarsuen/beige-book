Economic conditions in the Fourth District remained mixed in January and through   the first three weeks of February. On balance, conditions in this report were   very similar to the last: Conditions in residential construction were positive.   Although trucking and shipping contacts reported a slight seasonal decline,   conditions remained generally stable. Manufacturing, banking, and retail reports   were mixed. Commercial construction conditions remained poor. Winter weather   did have an adverse impact on several businesses in the region. Businesses in   retail and construction saw less customer traffic than usual, and many firms   across several industries temporarily closed operations because of severe winter   weather during the survey period.
While hints of future improvement can be found in this report (for example,   new orders in manufacturing increased slightly), little suggested conditions   would change in the near future. In the current environment, contacts remained   reluctant to forecast future economic conditions--most are basing future decisions   on the expectation that conditions will remain flat over the next few months.   A few firms reported reducing their capital expenditure plans since the first   of the year, but most appear to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude before   changing their budgets.
Labor market conditions have deteriorated since the last report--several manufacturers   reported having reduced their labor forces or planning to do so. The few firms   that were looking for employees reported no trouble in hiring--one contact reported   8,600 applications for 200 jobs at a new facility that would be opening in the   near future.
Looking forward, most contacts reported flat or slightly increasing new orders,   suggesting a slight pickup in production in the coming months, but most firms   were making no plans to increase their labor force or capital expenditures in   the near future. Most contacts reported that they would be able to respond to   a sudden pickup in demand by bringing their idle capacity on line.
Severe weather curtailed District auto production during the third week of   February, closing several plants in the area for at least one day. Despite these   closings, roughly half the District auto plants reported year-to-date production   above 2002 levels, and others reported year-to-date figures very near 2002 levels.
Demand for steel continued to soften in January and during the first three   weeks of February. Production and sales were slightly down from December 2002   levels but significantly below January 2002 levels. Steel prices remained under   downward pressure even as the cost of production increased significantly throughout   the winter. Many contacts expect significant reductions in the steel industry's   labor force as companies renegotiate labor contracts. Labor reports were mixed   among companies that did not have negotiated labor contracts: Some reported   that they were planning to hire back some of the many workers they laid off   in 2002, while others reported that they would lay off more workers if conditions   in the industry did not improve in the next month.
Automobile dealers in the District characterized sales in January as "lethargic"   (one contact noted that year-over-year sales were down 10 percent), but February   reports were mixed. Most contacts noted a rebound in sales, but a few continued   to report declines. Although dealers reported significant cuts in their advertising   budgets (some as high as 20 percent), they were optimistic about sales in the   coming months as manufacturers continue to offer incentives. As was the case   in the last report, inventories remain high (seventy-five- to one hundred-day   supplies--a sixty-day supply is preferable), but contacts were not as concerned   about climbing inventories as they were in the last report.
Commercial builders, on the other hand, continued to report weak conditions.   Worsening state and local budget crises have had an impact on the availability   of public construction projects (a major source of business for some firms in   2002). Competition for available projects in all areas of commercial construction   has increased. Some contacts noted, however, that architects have been seeing   an increase in business, suggesting a pickup will occur in commercial construction   in about a year.
For the first time in many reports, the industry experienced downward price   pressure as companies respond to slowing demand (in the last report, contacts   reported price increases). Profit margins have been shrinking as input prices,   especially labor and energy, continue to rise. Companies are attempting to contain   capital spending to replace worn-out equipment--several contacts noted recycling   trucks or buying them off the secondary market.
Reports regarding core deposit growth were also mixed, with a few contacts   reporting declines, but most reporting no change or growth. Those that reported   growth attributed it to heavy promotions, including free checking. Most contacts   reported a continued squeeze on spreads as loan rates adjust downward and funding   rates remain relatively constant.
