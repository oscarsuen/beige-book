Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicate continued sluggish economic   growth in much of the region during January and early February. While prices   remained stable for most consumer goods and services, prices for energy and   health care increased substantially. In labor markets, firms faced limited upward   pressure on wages and salaries but noted continued rapid increases in costs   for employee benefits. Many respondents pointed to uncertainties, due in part   to geopolitical risks, as having negatively affected both consumer and business   spending. Consumers appeared more cautious concerning expenditures on vehicles   and travel. Conditions in District manufacturing generally remained weak with   limited signs of improvement. The agricultural sector benefited from improved   exports and oil and natural gas producers operated at high levels of capacity.   Contacts reported continued strength in residential real estate, while commercial   real estate remained weak. Bank lending continued recent patterns of rapid growth   in residential mortgage loans and weak demand for business credit.
Persistent weak demand and ample supply in labor markets continued to damp   wage and salary pressures in the District in recent weeks. Contacts characterized   wages as flat or up modestly. However, health care and other benefits expenses   continued to increase rapidly.
District respondents reported continued weak demand for many services in January   and early February. Demand for accounting and legal services remained soft in   parts of the District; in California, a large law firm catering to the technology   sector closed. Transportation providers faced higher costs from rising fuel   prices and uncertain future demand associated with a potential war in Iraq.   Conditions in District travel and tourism were mixed. In Hawaii, for example,   both domestic and international tourism continued to improve; however, the improvement   was below expectations and the level of international tourism still has not   recovered fully after slumping in 2001. Looking forward, District travel and   hospitality industry contacts indicated that adverse effects on tourism from   a potential war would more than offset any positive effects associated with   the weakening value of the dollar in the foreign exchange market.
In contrast, contacts indicated that residential housing markets across much   of the District remained robust in January and early February. Sales of low-to-median   priced homes remained high in most of the District, especially in Southern California   and Hawaii, although the pace of sales and of price appreciation has moderated   in some areas. Throughout the District, contacts noted that markets for high-end   homes had cooled off. Respondents attributed continued strength in overall home   sales primarily to low mortgage interest rates.
