Ninth District economic activity was mixed from early January through late   February. Agriculture, home building, and mining grew. Manufacturing, tourism,   and energy were mixed. Consumer spending was flat and commercial construction   was down. Over this period, labor markets loosened slightly. Overall wage and   price increases were modest. Significant price increases were noted in heating   costs, gasoline, and tuition.
Home building and residential real estate activity were solid. The number of   housing units authorized in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area increased 14 percent   in January compared with a year earlier. "Every indication is that 2003 should   be another very busy year for builders," said a representative of a Minneapolis-St.   Paul area builders association. However, the vacancy rate for apartments in   Minneapolis-St. Paul increased to 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002,   up from 4 percent a year earlier. A representative of a realtors association   in La Crosse, Wis., expects 2003 to be another good year for single-family home   sales, but says 2003 will likely fall short of the 2002 sales record.
Auto sales dipped in January from December levels. According to a representative   of an auto dealers association in Minnesota, after a good December, auto sales   have "fallen off a cliff." An auto dealer in Minnesota noted a significant slowdown   in sales at several stores in January.
Winter tourism was mixed, primarily due to weather. The first seven weeks of   the winter tourism season were a "washout" due to a lack of snow in the Black   Hills area of South Dakota, according to a tourism official; however, since   the end of January, business has been up about 10 percent over last year. Businesses   in northern Wisconsin that depend on snowmobiling and cross-country skiing are   hurting, reported a university extension agent. In contrast, plenty of snow   in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan led to a recent 10 percent increase in lodging   expenditures in January compared with last year.
In contrast, a health benefits company in Duluth, Minn., plans to hire another   60 to 70 employees over the next six months. A call center in South Dakota has   hired 160 people since the beginning of the year and plans to hire 175 more.   A telemarketing company that opened in South Dakota in February plans to hire   as many as 50 employees, and a call center in Billings, Mont., will add 50 jobs.
Wage increases were modest. About 75 percent of respondents to a recent survey   by the St. Cloud (Minn.) Area Quarterly Business Report indicated no change   in employee compensation during the last three months of 2002. In Eau Claire,   Wis., two large unions agreed to pay a portion of their health insurance premiums   in exchange for pay increases of 3.75 percent during each of the next two years.
Overall price increases were modest, except for significant increases in heating   costs, gasoline, and tuition. Only 10 percent of respondents to the St. Cloud   (Minn.) Area Quarterly Business Report poll raised product prices during the   last three months of 2002, while 16 percent decreased prices. Heating costs   may rise as much as 10 percent to 35 percent over a year ago in several areas   of the District due to colder weather and higher natural gas prices, according   to energy companies. Gasoline prices at pumps in Minnesota were about 50 percent   higher than a year ago. Tuition and fees at four-year public universities in   North Dakota were up 14 percent for this academic year.
