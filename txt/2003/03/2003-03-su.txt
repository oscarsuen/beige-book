Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts generally suggested that   growth in economic activity remained subdued in January and February. Only a   few Districts reported any notable changes from the last Beige Book. In particular,   Richmond indicated that economic activity "grew modestly" and Kansas City noted   "some signs of strengthening;" by contrast, New York said that the regional   economy had "generally weakened." Many reports indicated that geopolitical and   economic uncertainties were constraining consumer and business spending and   tempering near-term expectations.
Consumer spending remained weak, on balance, with a few Districts noting a   little improvement and others indicating a slight deterioration. Business spending   was very soft, with little change in capital spending or hiring plans. Nearly   all Districts indicated that real estate and construction activities were mixed,   with strength on the residential side and weakness on the nonresidential side.   Most Districts still described manufacturing activity as weak or lackluster,   although half of the reports noted at least some degree of improvement. Refinancing   activity continued to drive growth in household loans, while business loan demand   remained weak. Contacts in most Districts expressed concern over rising energy   and insurance costs, but noted that businesses had difficulty passing along   much, if any, of the cost increases to their customers. The agricultural sector   continued to be affected by poor weather in many Districts. Mining and energy   extraction activity picked up, but energy production was limited by supply problems   and some shortages of skilled labor.
Most Districts reported that businesses were still very cautious about hiring   permanent workers, though Cleveland and Atlanta noted a pickup in the use of   overtime and part-time employees. Nearly half of the District reports suggested   that manufacturing industries were reducing their payrolls, and two said that   retailers were downsizing as well. State fiscal woes were cited as contributing   to layoffs in the Minneapolis and Kansas City regions. Staffing services firms   generally continued to report soft demand. A large employment agency in New   York noted that hiring for midlevel office jobs had been on the rise late in   2002, but had since dropped off. However, Dallas reported improved demand for   temporary workers in administrative, light industrial, and professional and   technical positions, and Richmond saw scattered increases in manufacturing.
Business lending activity remained weak in most of the nation, as many bankers   suggested that decisionmakers were reluctant to borrow in the face of continued   uncertainty surrounding geopolitical and economic conditions. Atlanta reported   that the bulk of commercial lending activity was driven by businesses refinancing   existing loans. However, bankers in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago   Districts saw slight increases in some commercial lending segments. Bankers   in one-third of the Districts reportedly tightened standards on some business   loans. There were few indications that overall quality on commercial loans had   changed in recent weeks, although bankers in the Philadelphia District noted   "some slippage in credit quality," while Chicago bankers suggested modest improvement.
Upward wage pressures remained generally subdued in nearly all Districts, but   some nonwage costs continued to rise, particularly for health and other insurance.   Minneapolis reported that two large unions had agreed to pay a portion of their   health insurance premiums in order to get 3.75 percent pay raises in each of   the next two years.
Few firms said they were able to pass along much, if any, of these cost increases   to their customers. Competition from both domestic and foreign producers helped   keep final goods prices in check. Most Districts suggested that price pressures   at the retail level remained largely subdued, with many merchants still resorting   to heavy discounts to move merchandise.
Due to higher prices, activity in the energy sector increased, though not evenly.   Kansas City and San Francisco reported strong oil and natural gas activity.   However, Dallas noted only a mild increase and Minneapolis said energy activity   was mixed. Current and potential disruptions to crude oil supplies continued   to hamper refining, especially in the Dallas District. Dallas also reported   that activity was held down by industry perceptions that the oil price increase   was temporary and by a shortage of trained workers. Higher metal prices helped   spur mining activity in the Minneapolis District.
