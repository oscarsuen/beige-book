The Tenth District economy showed some signs of strengthening in late January   and February, despite widespread uncertainty among businesses and consumers.   Retail sales posted slight gains, manufacturing activity improved, and energy   activity picked up. In addition, residential real estate activity continued   at a strong pace. On the negative side, auto sales were weak and commercial   real estate remained in a slump. In the farm economy, many ranchers and farmers   continued to suffer from the effects of drought. Wage and price pressures remained   largely subdued across the District.
