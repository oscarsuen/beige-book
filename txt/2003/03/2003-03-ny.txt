The Second District's economy has generally softened since the last report,   with the notable exception of housing, which appears to have regained some momentum.   Signs of weakness are particularly evident in the labor market. While business   contacts report increased cost pressures, mainly for insurance and energy, these   pressures show no signs of feeding into finished-goods prices. The Presidents   Day snowstorm had a large effect on the retail sector but little disruptive   effect on manufacturing or shipping.
Retailers note that sales were below plan in recent weeks, particularly during   and after the blizzard. Selling prices and merchandise costs were described   as steady to lower than a year ago, while retail inventories were said to be   in fairly good shape. Manufacturers indicate mixed but generally softer conditions   in recent weeks; they also note increased upward cost pressures but flat to   declining selling prices.
Home construction and the housing market generally have picked up since the   last report, though the upper end of the market remains weak. Manhattan's office   market has been stable to slightly weaker in early 2003, with rents continuing   to fall. Conditions in New York City's financial industry have reportedly deteriorated   since the last report. Finally, bankers report some weakening in consumer loan   demand, a modest upturn in consumer delinquency rates, and tighter lending standards   on commercial borrowers.
Apparel sales were generally described as weak, though outerwear again performed   better than other categories; a number of contacts noted particularly strong   sales of jewelry. Demand for home furnishings and appliances was described as   mixed. Despite the recent weakness in sales, most retail contacts say that inventories   are in good shape. Retailers report that selling prices are flat to down moderately   and describe the pricing environment as highly competitive. Merchandise and   labor costs are said to be little changed, but retailers report steep increases   in utility and insurance costs.
Regional surveys of consumer confidence have given mixed but generally weak   signals. Siena College's monthly survey of New York State residents showed confidence   rebounding from a cyclical trough in January, led by the New York City area.   However, the Conference Board reports that confidence in the Middle Atlantic   states--New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania--fell to a new cyclical low in   January.
Both single-family and multifamily housing permits in the District rebounded   in December, after drifting down in the prior two months. More recently, homebuilders   in northern New Jersey report that demand remains strong for homes selling for   under $1 million, but note that demand has weakened further at the top end of   the market, particularly in areas near New York City. An industry contact notes   that labor and material costs are not a problem but that liability insurance   coverage is increasingly difficult--builders are more concerned about availability   than the rising cost.
Manhattan's commercial real estate market was steady to slightly weaker in   January. Lower Manhattan's availability rate inched up, after improving slowly   but steadily in the second half of 2002. However, rates held steady in Midtown   and edged down in Midtown South. Still, asking rents throughout the city continued   to decline; they have fallen by roughly 20 percent from their early-2001 peaks,   and industry experts note that the decline in actual rents has been much steeper.   On the supply side, there is a moderate amount of new office space currently   under construction in Manhattan: roughly 3 million square feet is scheduled   for completion this year and another nearly 4 million in 2004. Together, this   represents slightly over 1 percent of the total stock, and all of this new space   will be in Midtown.
A contact in New York City's securities industry reports that conditions have   deteriorated noticeably since the last report. In addition to increased weakness   in the financial markets, stock issuance, and mergers and acquisitions, recent   litigation settlements and increased liability have further affected securities   firms' bottom lines. Bonus payments are estimated to be down 20 percent to 30   percent from last year's levels, and there is no indication of a pickup in hiring   on the horizon.
The manufacturing sector has given mixed signals since the last report. Purchasing   managers in both the Buffalo and Rochester areas report some pickup in manufacturing   activity in January but further declines in employment levels; they also note   widespread increases in input prices. New York City-area purchasers report that   manufacturing sector conditions were flat in January, after broad improvement   in December, and indicate little change in input prices; while they express   increased optimism about the near-term business outlook, a majority anticipates   staff cutbacks in the industry in 2003. More recently, our February survey of   New York State manufacturers indicates some leveling off in business conditions,   following three months of improvement. Manufacturers note increased upward pressure   on input costs but downward pressure on selling prices. Respondents also expressed   less optimism about the near-term outlook than in recent months. While the survey   was taken prior to the Presidents Day blizzard, there has been no indication   that the storm had any substantial effect on production.
Separately, a major freight shipping firm reports that the snowstorm had little   disruptive effect at the seaports during the subsequent workweek, causing only   scattered minor delays. More generally, this contact characterizes shipping   activity as very strong.
On the supply side, bankers continue to report tightening credit standards   for commercial borrowers--roughly one in six bankers reports tighter standards   for commercial and industrial loans, while none reports an easing of standards.   Credit standards for residential mortgages and consumer loans remained little   changed. Both loan rates and deposit rates continued to decline across the board.   Lenders report an upturn in delinquency rates on consumer loans, which cannot   be attributed entirely to seasonal fluctuations--twice as many respondents indicate   that they are rising as rates are declining. Delinquency rates are reported   to be stable in the other categories.
