Contacts in the Eighth District reported lackluster business conditions in   recent months, with little change from the last survey. In manufacturing, reports   of weak sales, consolidations, closings and cutbacks have continued. Retail   sales during December and January were mostly flat from a year ago but met expectations.   Auto sales over the same period declined. Residential real estate markets are   still strong, while commercial real estate markets remain weak. Over the past   three months, there was essentially no change in lending activity.
Car dealers in the District reported that sales in December and January were   down over year-earlier levels, on average. Almost all contacts attributed this   trend to an uncertain economy and the threat of war. Several car dealers reported   that used and low-end cars are selling better than new cars, causing inventories   of used cars to be okay-to-low and inventories of new cars to be okay-to-high.   About 35 percent of the contacts surveyed noted higher rejection rates of finance   applications, while the rest saw no change. A third of the dealers surveyed   expect sales to be flat-to-slightly-down over last year in the next few months,   the rest expect a moderate increase.
The increasing price of diesel fuel has many contacts from small and midsize   trucking firms concerned about their already narrow profit margins. A major   packing and shipping firm in the District has announced a plan to lay off pilots   in the next year, citing a decrease in shipping volume as the reason for the   cut. In the health-care sector, contacts noted that the nursing shortage has   persisted, especially in the non-urban areas of the District. Contacts in all   industries continued to experience the burden of increasing health-care insurance   costs.
Commercial real estate markets are still slow in most of the District. St.   Louis continues to experience an increase in office vacancy rates. Contacts   in both Louisville and Fayetteville reported increased office vacancy rates   at the end of 2002. Commercial construction is weak in most District areas.   In northeast Arkansas, activity has continued to be slow and is not expected   to pick up in the spring. In Memphis, contacts reported that there is virtually   no building. In central Kentucky, construction of hospitals, churches, and college   facilities are under way or have just been completed, but several that have   been announced are being delayed because of uncertainty about the economy.
