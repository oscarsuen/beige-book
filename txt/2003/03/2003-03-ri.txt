Economic activity in the Fifth District grew modestly in January and the first   three weeks of February, with a slight improvement in services and manufacturing   conditions offsetting a listless retail sector. Services businesses reported   generally steady to slightly higher demand, and some contacts cited higher orders   for coming months. District manufacturing activity expanded somewhat faster,   as shipments and new orders rose sharply in January and early February. In contrast,   retail sales were little changed from our previous report, and retailers continued   to trim payrolls. Price inflation remained modest according to contacts. In   the real estate sector, District home sales rose at a solid rate, but commercial   leasing activity slowed as war prospects unsettled potential lessees. In agriculture,   unusually cold and snowy weather hampered field preparation and led to the abandonment   of still-unharvested crops in some areas of the District.
Commercial realtors reported slower growth in leasing activity in recent weeks   as potential lessees in the office sector adopted a "wait and see" attitude   in light of political developments internationally. A realtor in Raleigh, N.C.,   captured the mood of many with the observation that "people are just waiting   on the sidelines." The leasing of retail space picked up--a realtor in Richmond,   Va., for example, experienced "very high" growth over the past six weeks in   retail leasing. But office and industrial space leasing was sluggish. Vacancy   rates for retail space remained low, while office vacancy rates edged higher.   Rents for retail space held firm, but edged lower for office space. Realtors   in Washington, D.C. and Charlotte, N.C., noted that some tenants had recently   renegotiated their leases, obtaining lower rents and other concessions. New   commercial construction was generally flat across sectors--several realtors   in the Carolinas reported a shift to refurbishing older buildings in lieu of   building new ones.
