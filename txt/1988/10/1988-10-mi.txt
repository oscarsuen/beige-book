Ninth District economic conditions have remained stable at satisfactory levels. Unemployment rates have not changed much. Consumer spending has been fairly healthy while inflation rates continued to be moderate. Conditions in resource-related industries have improved, and those in agriculture have remained largely unchanged.
Motor vehicles have been selling well. In particular, truck and van sales are reported to be up sharply over last year. One manufacturer of a domestic line reports that, even at full capacity, demand cannot be met. New models are generally expected to sell well.
Housing activity has been mixed. The number of homes sold in August in the Twin Cities area was 12.4 percent below the banner sales of a year ago. However, new housing permits issued in the whole state of Minnesota were up 9 percent during that period.
Tourist spending has also continued to increase. Despite the drought, the fall colors are an attractive sight throughout the district. Most areas contacted in Minnesota indicate good resort business, as do those in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In Montana, however, the fire at Yellowstone has kept the number of August tourists 7 percent below a year ago. Still, one observer thinks that a sizable number of tourists have actually been attracted by the fire.
