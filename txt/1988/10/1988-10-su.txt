Most districts report continuing growth in their regional economies. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco all report further expansion over the past six weeks. Four districts—Atlanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas—report slow or sluggish growth. Boston represents general business sentiment as cautious, and Minneapolis says business conditions have held steady.
Though conditions in agriculture vary across districts, it now appears that, in the aggregate, the drought will have a much smaller impact on farm income than was originally thought. The slump in oil prices has depressed the energy industry in the Dallas district, but the effect has been minimal elsewhere. Construction of residential dwellings, especially multifamily structures, is slow and homebuilders are preparing for further declines; nonresidential construction, though, remains healthy. The manufacturing sector continues to expand, bolstered by a growing demand for exports. The outlook calls for caution and some easing in activity, however. Retail trade remains sluggish in most parts of the country, and store operators are anticipating only modest gains in the fourth quarter. In the financial sector, demand for consumer loans remains strong, led by home equity borrowing. Business lending is holding up as well.
Minneapolis reports that gold-mining operations in Montana have expanded in the last year and that the stage may be set for expansion in copper mining as well. As a result, mine employment may be headed for its highest level in that district since 1983.
Despite the continued growth in manufacturing and the expansion of factory employment, wage pressures do not appear to be mounting at this time. Price movements vary by region and industry, but are generally moderate.
Plans for increased capital spending by manufacturers are reported by several districts. In the New York District, major manufacturers of steel, automobiles, and electronic equipment have announced plans to establish new plants or enhance existing operations. Dallas indicates that chemical producers are straining capacity and are planning expansion. In the Philadelphia District, over 40 percent of the respondents to the monthly Business Outlook Survey say they plan to spend more on plant and equipment in the next six months.
Despite the current boom in the sector, manufacturers are becoming less optimistic about coming months. Several districts say a slight slowdown became evident in late summer and that manufacturers, foreseeing a leveling off of activity through the first half of 1989, have become very cautious. For the second month in a row, manufacturers in the Richmond District are anticipating a drop in business activity from current levels over the next six months.
Despite continued sluggishness in sales, retail inventories at stores in most districts are at acceptable, lean levels thanks to strict monitoring and tight ordering policies. And, although sales remain low relative to plan, Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco all report difficulty in hiring qualified, in-store help and note some upward pressure on wages as a result.
Retail prices are mixed. Boston reports that prices of lower-end merchandise are fairly stable, but that prices of higher-end items are rising fairly quickly. Minneapolis says price increases have been moderate and that some retailers in that region have switched to domestic suppliers as the prices of imported goods have gone up.
Sales of cars and, especially, of trucks are reported to be strong in most districts. Cleveland reports slower sales stemming from a small inventory of 1988 leftovers and the reluctance of dealers to make price concessions to clear them out. In St. Louis, sales have leveled off after seven months of strong gains.
The outlook for retail sales can be sunned up in one word: cautious. Store officials' forecasts for the fourth quarter range from "moderate" to "slightly improved." No one, however, is predicting a boom in holiday sales and most are likely to continue their policies of tight inventory management.
