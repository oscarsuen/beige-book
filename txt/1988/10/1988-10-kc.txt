On balance, district bankers report that the rate of farmer participation in the wheat price-support program is nearly unchanged from last year's rate. On one hand, a sharply higher market price for wheat has diminished the incentive for farmers to participate in the federal price support program for wheat. On the ether hand, a reduction in the percentage of wheat base acres that program participants must hold out of production encourages program participation.
The new winter wheat crop received beneficial September rains that promoted development of winter wheat pastures, but additional rainfall will be required to ensure adequate grazing conditions in many areas. In the absence of adequate wheat pastures, feed stocks could be strained during a severe winter. Ranchers would then be forced to buy high-priced feed or liquidate herds. At present, most district ranchers plan to maintain herds through the winter in anticipation of higher cattle prices next spring.
