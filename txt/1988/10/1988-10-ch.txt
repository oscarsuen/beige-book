SteelMills are largely booked through year-end. Production slowed less than usual last summer as producers used vacation and maintenance shutdowns at customers' plants to reduce order backlogs. Some maintenance work at steel mills has been deferred in order to meet strong demand. Among major markets, demand for construction steel is strong, particularly for industrial projects. Orders also continue strong from makers of construction equipment and other machinery, are at a good pace from auto companies, and have risen (from a low level) from makers of railcars. However, orders for oil country tubular goods have dropped as buyers, facing lower oil prices, have tried to cut inventories. In addition, delays in pipeline construction have curtailed orders for steel from that sector.
Recent figures confirm that farm equipment sales turned sluggish again this summer as farmers became apprehensive about the drought. However, industry analysts are looking for a modest upturn to resume by early next year. Despite the drought, the demand for farm equipment is likely to be sustained by high cash farm earnings and by a sizable increase in crop plantings next year.
