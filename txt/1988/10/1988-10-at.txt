The southeastern economy continues its somewhat sluggish pace overall. Weakening growth in manufacturing, largely reflecting downturns in transportation equipment, combines with a slower pace in the retail trade sector to hold total employment gains under the year-ago level. However, some sectors are performing quite well and scarcities of skilled laborers have been reported by textile and appliance producers and in oil drilling operations, though wages are not reported to be under much upward pressure. A number of industrial contacts report rising input prices and the ability to pass them on to manufactured products because of strong demand. Inventory levels are generally lean and retailers seem especially cautious to avoid overstocking problems, similar to those experienced in last year's fourth quarter. Export trade is unusually brisk across a wide range of products and growth appears to be gathering momentum.
Appliance producers note selected labor shortages and increased production costs due to rising raw material costs. However, it is difficult to recoup rising costs through price increases because the slowdown in residential construction is now weakening appliance shipments. The housing slowdown is also dampening lumber markets. In contrast to appliance and lumber manufacturers, the district's tire and rubber industry is faring well. Although raw material costs are rising, tire producers are able to increase prices because demand for time is currently outstripping supply. Apparel and textile producers expressed a mixed outlook with some firms running overtime while others report that orders are short for this time of year. Most are keeping tight control over production and inventories are being cut back as far as practically possible.
Paper mills are doing exceptionally well with both export and domestic demand expected to remain at high levels for the remainder of the year and into the next. Orders are growing and prices are firm. By contrast, local aircraft and several defense related equipment manufacturers are cutting back operations because of reduced orders.
The housing industry is bracing for a further slowing of activity. The District states are just beginning to feel the impact of rising interest rates on home sales. Home prices in Atlanta dropped in August to their lowest level in over a year, and contacts report that September prices were low as well. In Florida, areas of the state such as Miami, Orlando and Tampa reported slowing sales in the third quarter as rising interest rates began to impact the market.
Bank failures in District states have declined from a year ago. Sources in Louisiana, the most troubled state, report a downward trend in the number of bank closures there and prospects continue to brighten because of recent reductions in loan delinquencies and improvement in the local economy.
Despite continued sluggishness, the oil industry has experienced a bunt of new offshore activity in the Gulf waters off the coast of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Oil production, however, remains down considerably over last year and the number of motive rigs in the District has slipped 7 percent since the previous year.
