Auto dealers report sluggish sales compared to a year ago, reportedly because inventories of 1988 model cars are low and manufacturers and dealers are not making large price concessions to clear them out. Initial dealer experience with sales of the 1989 models ranges from slow to very good. Those reporting slow sales blame the rather large price increase on various new models.
Hiring projections by employers in the District suggest that employment growth will continue to be strong in the fourth quarter. Substantial increases in employment are expected by employers in 19 of the 25 District cities covered in a recent survey of hiring expectations. Hiring is expected to be brisk in the four largest cities in the District: Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati. Some smaller cities, such as Akron, are expecting even larger employment gains.
Across the district, new job opportunities are expected in wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing, services, and finance, insurance, and real estate. For example, two large automobile manufacturers have announced major expansions in Northern Ohio, which will directly add aver 2,000 new jobs.
Ohio manufacturing wages have fallen slightly, primarily due to a shorter workweek.
Preliminary estimates of manufacturing output in Ohio show a 4.3 percent annual increase, after adjusting for unusual weather conditions. Most of the increase comes from the durable-goods sectors. Primary metals and fabricated metals showed particularly strong growth. For example, raw steel production in Ohio rose 9.0 percent during the last three months over the same three-month period a year ago.
Output growth is expected to continue as District purchasing managers report increases in new orders and declines in finished good inventories. However, some purchasing managers report that vendors are still having trouble meeting the demands of producers as firms continue to build up their inventories of raw materials.
Manufacturers report that production continues at capacity rates in chemicals, plastics, glass, ceramics, specialty steel, and container industries. A wide variety of commodities, particularly bearings, electric motors, and a number of chemical, steel, and aluminum products, remain in short supply leading in some cases to price increases. For example, steel prices are reported to be up 6 to 7 percent from a year ago, and since prices have risen 50 percent since January.
