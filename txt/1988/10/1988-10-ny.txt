The Second District economy remains generally healthy and registered one further modest expansion since the last report. The percentage of purchasing managers who reported improved business conditions increased and leasing activity in the District's office markets continued at a moderate pace. Retail sales were sluggish during August but spending picked up somewhat in September. Activity among homebuilders has generally been slow though there continue to be some areas of strength. Small and medium-sized banks report strong demand for home equity loans.
During August sales at District retailers whom we contact declined from a year earlier by from 0.5 percent to 5.5 percent, results which were definitely below plan. With the unusual heat, the main items in strong demand were air conditioners and fans. September brought a general improvement in sales with over-the-year changes ranging from -2.0 percent to +10.0 percent. For the most part, sales remained somewhat below plan but retailers are hopeful that year-to-year gains will increase as the holiday season nears. Despite lower-than-expected sales, inventories are generally at satisfactory levels and actually below plan at some retail chains as a result of strict monitoring.
Plans for several new projects in the District were recently announced. Port Chester, N.Y. officials signed an agreement for a $200 million harbor redevelopment which will include condominium homes, a yacht club, boat slips, a restaurant and commercial-retail space. In another attempt to reclaim a waterfront, Buffalo officials approved a $63 million plan which will include shops, offices, a hotel and a lakefront park. Since one of the developers of this plan was involved in the restoration of the Boston, Baltimore, and New York City waterfronts, Buffalo is hopeful that its project will also prove to be a popular tourist attraction. In the manufacturing sector, Bethlehem Steel unveiled plans to spend some $45 million over the next few years to enhance its three remaining operations in the Buffalo area. This follows announcements made earlier that General Motors will invest $80 million to build a new series of hi-tech engines beginning this fall and that Motorola will build a new plant in that area as well.
Leasing activity in the District's office market continued at a moderate pace in recent weeks. Additional leases were signed for extensive space in several of the commercial buildings under construction on the developing west side of Manhattan and some renewed activity took place in lower Manhattan as well. Long Island continues to have one of the lowest office vacancy rates in the suburban U.S., due in part to temporary moratoriums placed by some communities on new buildings in recent years. Realtors report a turnaround in Westchester County's office market with increased demand and virtually no new supply resulting in lower vacancy rates and increased rentals.
A number of bankers noted that borrowers using home   equity credit for debt consolidation usually did so for the tax   advantage, not because they felt pressed to reschedule overwhelming   debt. However, few banks actually inquire about the purpose of the   loan in the credit screening process. The officers believed that   prudence by borrowers and strict credit standards have thus far   resulted in very low delinquency rates for home equity loans. Many   commented that home equity loans have by far the lowest delinquency   rates of any consumer loan in their bank's portfolio.
