Reports from other District sectors were mixed. Depository institutions indicated little change in commercial loan demand but continued strength in home equity loans. Farmers gave uneven reports on the fall harvest and were uncertain as to how disaster payments will be made. Resort and hotel representatives said this summer's tourist activity was above last summer's, but that fall bookings were about the same as at this time a year ago.
Participants in our surveys were also asked about their expectations for the next six months. Among producers, optimism declined for the second month in a row, but most still expect business conditions to remain the same or improve in the months ahead. Among retailers, optimism about the economic outlook remained at last month's high level. Most of the bankers contacted expect interest rates to rise, but most homebuilders expect mortgage rates to decline. District farmers who escaped the worst of the drought expect their incomes this year to be above those of a year ago, and they look for further income gains next year.
Sales activity varied by type of store. Among department stores, about 40 percent reported decreases in sales, and about 20 percent reported increases. Sales of big ticket items declined in 20 percent of the department stores and rose in about 10 percent. Most car dealers reported increases in sales, while most furniture stores reported no change.
Most District resorts and hotels contacted by telephone said this summer's tourist activity was higher than last summer's. Bookings for this fall are about the same as at this time last year.
Prices of manufacturers' materials have apparently continued to rise, but the pace of increase slowed for the third consecutive month. Fifty percent of our respondents said that prices of raw materials increased in September, compared with 61 percent who reported increases in August.
For the second consecutive month, manufacturers who said they expect decreases nationally in the general level of business activity exceeded the number who expect an upturn. Twenty-eight percent anticipate a decline in the next six months, while 20 percent anticipate an increase. With regard to the outlook for their own businesses, 40 percent of the respondents believe their shipments will rise in the next six months and 31 percent anticipate declines. Producers who foresee declines in their unfilled orders, workweeks, and inventories of materials and finished goods outnumbered those who expect increases.
Reports of the demand for residential mortgages varied widely. About the same number of respondents reported increases as decreases. Many respondents said the demand for home equity loans remains strong despite the winding down of promotional efforts.
Total farm income in the District probably will be higher this year than last. Farm production this year is expected to match production of last year, which was also a year of drought in the District. This year, however, farm prices—including the prices of poultry, and those of most crops—have been higher because the drought was a national phenomenon that reduced supplies.
