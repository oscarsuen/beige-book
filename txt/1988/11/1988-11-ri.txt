District manufacturers have become more optimistic about the growth of general business activity in the nation. In our previous two surveys, manufacturers who expected decreases in national activity exceeded the number who expected an upturn, but in our latest survey, the respondents who expect some change in national activity were evenly split between those expecting increases and those expecting decreases over the next six months. With regard to the outlook for their own businesses, most respondents believe their shipments will hold steady or rise in the next six months.
Another of our telephone surveys indicated that office vacancy rates in several large District cities either remained steady or edged down in the third quarter from second quarter levels. The office vacancy rates in the cities surveyed ranged from 13 percent in Baltimore to 21 percent in Norfolk. Vacancies in the Raleigh-Durham area have recently dropped below 20 percent, but more space is slated to open there soon.
