Domestic auto dealers report that sales are about the same as a year ago. The current pace of auto sales has been sustained without resorting to special incentive programs, which were used extensively a year ago. Few 1988 models remain in dealers inventories, and dealers indicate that inventories of 1989 models are in line with expected sales. Popular imported cars are selling well, although not as briskly as a year ago.
Average hourly earnings of manufacturing workers have been very stable, despite the recent upturn in average weekly hours from 42.3 hours to 42.5 hours. According to two separate surveys, area compensation managers are budgeting about the same level of wage and salary hikes for the coming year (4.6 percent) as they granted in 1988. Average pay increases range from a low of 3.4 percent for unionized production workers to almost 5 percent for executives and managers. Manufacturers reported lower expected increases than did nonmanufacturing companies.
Purchasing managers report that, while production continues to increase, the backlog of orders has fallen and new orders are up only slightly. In addition, vendor delivery performance continues to improve, indicating that vendors have more time to service their accounts.
Commodity, service, and equipment prices are still increasing, but less quickly, according to purchasing managers. For the first time in several months, less than half the respondents reported general commodity price increases.
