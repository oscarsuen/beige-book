Most respondents at Tenth District saving and loan institutions report that savings inflows are little changed either from a year ago or from a month ago. Virtually all respondents expect little change in savings inflows in the near future. Mortgage demand has slowed recently, partly due to seasonal factors. Mortgage interest rates have remained steady or increased slightly recently, and are expected to increase further in the next several months.
Most ranchers are expected to maintain their herds through the winter months, in spite of high prices for drought-diminished forage supplies.  Grazing of the winter wheat crop's early growth has eased demand for tight supplies of other forages. But high feed prices are still likely to limit any significant expansion in cattle herds despite currently high cattle prices.
The drought apparently has had little effect on agricultural credit conditions in the district. Most district lenders expect strong farm incomes and little change in loan repayment rates. Solid farm incomes are already being reflected in an active market for new and used farm machinery and in strong farmland prices. On balance, the 1985 drought appears to have had little adverse impact on district farmers or their lenders. And drought diminished crop inventories could brighten the farm outlook for the year ahead.
