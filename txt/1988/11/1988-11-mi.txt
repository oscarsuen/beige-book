Ninth District Economic Conditions are good. Unemployment rates have not changed much. Consumer spending has stayed at satisfactory levels and consumer price increases continued to be moderate, but some raw material prices have increased sharply. Conditions in resource-related industries continued to improve and those in agriculture remain largely unchanged.
Motor vehicles are generally selling well, though there is reported to be some shift from new to used car sales, particularly in the Dakotas. One domestic line reports that car sales were up 36 percent in October from the depressed levels of a year ago. Truck and van sales are particularly good and manufacturers report difficulty in meeting demand. Recreational vehicles are selling exceptionally well and the bigger and better 1989 models are in heavy demand.
Housing activity is generally lower than a year ago. The number of new housing permits issued in Minnesota in September was down 35 percent from a year ago. Reflecting recent strength, total housing sales in the Twin Cities area in October were up 33.4 percent from a year ago. However they were down 13.2 percent for the first ten months of the year compared with the same period last year. Housing activity is good in some parts of the district. The Upper Peninsula reports that new mortgages issued by banks are at record levels. Mobile home sales are reported to be higher in South Dakota than last year.
Tourist spending continues to be strong, particularly in the Upper Peninsula which reports the number of tourists was 10 percent higher thus far this year than last year. Ski resorts anticipate an excellent year due to the early and heavy snowfall in many areas. An initiative to allow limited gambling in the city of Deadwood, South Dakota has passed and is expected to be approved by the Legislature. Proponents hope this move will attract more tourists to that historic city.
