Employment in all nonmanufacturing sectors grew slower in the District than in the nation in the third quarter. Employment in the region's services and wholesale/retail trade sectors declined slightly in both the second and third quarters after rising in every previous quarter of the recovery.
District manufacturing employment grew at a 2.7 percent rate in the third quarter, after declining at a 2.8 percent rate in the second quarter. In comparison, national manufacturing employment increased at a 1.4 percent rate during the third quarter, after growing at 2.3 percent rate during the previous three months. The District's recent growth was concentrated in factories producing electrical equipment, nonelectrical machinery, chemicals and transportation equipment. Approximately 2,100 workers—many of whom had been laid off since November 1987—were recalled to a St. Louis area auto assembly plant in September. Increasing orders for motor vehicle parts led to 1,100 additional jobs over the last 12 months in Arkansas.
Department stores throughout the District generally expect real sales during the upcoming holiday season to be only a few percent above last year's level and have accordingly kept inventories slim, Numerous pre-holiday sales already have appeared, and widespread price discounting is expected throughout December.
The rain also has helped to recharge dry soils and has improved pastures, a development that will allow livestock producers to carry larger herds through the winter. This should alleviate some of the pressure on red meat prices that had been feared for next year had livestock producers been forced to reduce herds further. Because of the availability of storage space and the long harvest period, no grain transportation difficulties have been encountered.
