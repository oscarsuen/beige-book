The rate of expansion in the Second District's economy may have slowed somewhat since the last report. The latest purchasing managers' surveys continue to show most firms reporting improved to stable conditions, but a smaller share than in recent reports, and some department stores have recently experienced an over-the-year decline in sales. The pace of homebuilding remains slow for the most part, but a pickup occurred in commercial real estate activity. Commercial and industrial loan demand at small and medium-sized banks in the District has been slow to moderate, though a few loan officers reported some strength.
Reflecting the differing sales results, reactions were also mixed concerning the level of inventories and the ability to meet sales targets. Those retailers with sales below plan and excessive inventories intend somewhat more aggressive promotionals in the weeks ahead, while others anticipate no change in strategy.
Most of our contacts reported some pickup in sales of women's apparel from the slow pace earlier this year, and some noted that unusually cool weather spurted outerwear sales as well. With regard to the outlook, retailers are moderately optimistic about the upcoming holiday season but generally do not anticipate large over-the-year gains.
Unemployment rates in the District remain below the national average with October readings of 4.2 percent in New York and 3.9 percent in New Jersey. As was true nationally, rates in the District have fluctuated within a fairly narrow range the past several months. The October-to-October rate decline in New York was virtually the same as the national average, but in New Jersey where last October's rate was already very low, the year-to-year decrease was slight.
Few new major projects were announced in the District since the last report. However, western New York was buoyed by some recent developments. Two "upscale" New York City department stores announced plans to make their Buffalo area debut in a new shopping mall now under construction there-further indication of Buffalo's comeback from its earlier loss of several manufacturing firms. In addition, a major supermarket chain plans to open three large superstores in Buffalo and Niagara Falls.
A pickup occurred in District commercial real estate activity recently. During October the midtown Manhattan market experienced its highest level of leasing activity since July 1986, and downtown Manhattan also registered more strength than had been seen since the stock market crash. The pace of leasing activity has also been moderate to good in other parts of the District. However, vacancy rates have shown little change because of a sizable supply of office space coming on line in many areas.
