Sales volume differed widely across cities and across product lines. For instance, one major retailer reported that sales were up 12.5 percent in their Pittsburgh stores but up only 5 percent in their Cleveland stores. Sales of apparel were up, due partly to the deep discounting before Christmas. On the other hand, sales of durable home goods were down, reflecting consumer caution after October's stock market decline. Discount retailers reported a greater increase in sales than top-of-the-line outlets. The consensus among retailers was that sales will slow down during the first half of 1988. Prices are expected to show only a modest increase as price pressure from imports eases.
Reports from purchasing managers concurred with the uptick in the output index. In the Cleveland area, all indicators were higher in November than in previous months. Respondents to the purchasing managers survey indicated higher employment, higher raw material, supply, and finished product inventories, and an increase in new orders. Two-thirds of the respondents reported higher prices. Specialty steel items and plastics products were reported to be in short supply. Purchasing managers in the Cincinnati area reported these indicators to be "at strong levels," but down slightly from the three-year highs of the past few months.
Steel production in the Youngstown and Pittsburgh areas remained strong. Youngstown producers shipped 6 percent more steel in December than they did in December of 1986. Pittsburgh producers shipped 13 percent more than a year ago.
Exports continued to be largely responsible for the increase in manufacturing activity. Machinery, chemicals, and instruments contributed significantly to the increase in export activity. One local business person remarked that for the first time he is now able to sell machine tools to various Asian countries.
Area businesses anticipated moderate hiring in the first quarter of 1988. In Akron, 43 percent of local employers surveyed by a nationwide employment agency planned to increase staff, while only 3 percent expected cutbacks. Pittsburgh area businesses were less optimistic. Only 17 percent of those surveyed planned to increase staff during the next three months. Twenty percent said that they anticipated cutbacks. The Cleveland area hiring outlook appeared mixed. Twenty-five percent of local businesses expected to increase their workforce, while the same percentage expected to cut back. Overall, job opportunities looked best in services and durable manufacturing.
