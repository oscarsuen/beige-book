Unfolding national economic trends also are evident in a reading of business conditions in southeastern states. Manufacturing activity is strong in many foreign trade related activities such as agriculture, paper and chemicals. Producers in housing and consumer goods industries are becoming concerned about soft demand. Holiday spending, while not great, turned out to be better than retailers expected in the immediate aftermath of the stock market crash. Although construction activity continues to slow, the regional economy is comparatively healthy on balance.
The chemical and paper industries are benefiting from higher prices, improved domestic and foreign sales, and lessened import competition. Strong textile markets also have helped segments of the chemical industry, and the cheaper dollar has encouraged foreign paper mills to buy U.S. wood pulp. New paper mills and plant expansions have recently been announced.
Defense related government contracts continue to benefit the region; in Huntsville, the new space station contract will eventually add 2000 new jobs to payrolls. In metals, more than 500 steelworkers in Alabama are expected to return to work earlier than originally planned and an aluminum smelting plant is returning to full production in Tennessee. On the other hand, home appliance manufacturers are concerned about scaled-back consumer spending, lower housing start levels and rising raw material prices.
Auto dealers feel that December's sales compared rather well with year-end 1986 considering strong tax incentives at that time. Light trucks continue to be the star performer offsetting some weakness in domestic car models. The geographic pattern of vehicle sales in 1987 mirrored the overall consumer spending pattern in the Districtâ€”activity in the eastern part was stronger than that nationally, while the western part lagged behind the nation's performance.
Analysts expect the widespread commercial construction and leasing slowdown to continue this year. The office market, in particular, remains overbuilt in most of the large markets. A notable exception is Orlando, where high absorption and a cutback in development in 1987 caused its office vacancy rate to drop significantly. According to recent reports, foreign investors' interest and participation in Atlanta's commercial real estate market is growing. The Japanese have been the most active, but European investors' activity is also growing.
Southeastern crop farmers are enjoying higher prices. Florida's citrus industry is especially benefiting from a larger crop and stable to higher prices. Forest industries are continuing to prosper, with a bright outlook for 1988.
