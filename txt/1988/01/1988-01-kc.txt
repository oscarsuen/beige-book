District savings institutions generally report that savings deposit inflows are somewhat above year-ago levels. Deposit inflows have changed little since November and are expected to improve slightly during the first quarter. Mortgage demand remains weak, although some respondents foresee a pickup in activity in the spring. Mortgage rates have been stable, with little change expected in the near term.
Farm machinery sales are also beginning to reflect an improved farm income situation in the district. After two relatively stable years for farm incomes, some operators are now upgrading worn equipment. The used machinery market has shown more activity, but high prices and a cautious outlook are still keeping many farmers out of the new equipment market.
Although livestock prices have contributed significantly to the strength in farm income, there has not been much expansion in district livestock operations. Feedlots in the region remain full, but cow/calf operators are reluctant to hold back high priced heifers to increase breeding herds. High cattle prices have also forced the price of replacement animals up, causing some stocker cattle operations to actually reduce herds. Most district hog growers have been running at capacity, but there has been little facilities expansion. The recent downturn in hog prices has not yet had a visible effect on district hog operations.
