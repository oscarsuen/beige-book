The District economy has apparently expanded further in recent weeks. Most of our directors and advisory council members reported that their local economies were robust at year-end, and our regular surveys showed a continuation of rising employment in retailing and manufacturing. Retail sales for the most part held up well through Christmas and retailers look for good winter and spring sales. Manufacturers reported generally strong activity and higher input prices, but they were somewhat less optimistic than they were a few weeks ago about their growth prospects. In other selected District sectors, financial institutions said they expect a pickup in some categories of loan activity, and most seaports reported increases in volume.
District retailers expect their sales to increase in the next six months. Sixty-five percent of those surveyed believe their sales will rise over the period, although about one-third expect weakness in big ticket items.
The percentage of manufacturers who expect shipments and orders to increase over the next six months were unchanged from the previous survey. In our two latest surveys, both conducted since the stock market crash, about 40 percent of the producers indicated that they believed their shipments and new orders would grow during the first half of the year, as compared to about 50 percent who anticipated growth before the crash. Most manufacturers plan to reduce their inventories of materials in the next six months, but most also expect their inventories of finished goods to rise.
The prices of both raw materials and finished products evidently rose further in recent weeks according to District manufacturers. Fifty-seven percent of the respondents reported higher raw materials prices and 32 percent reported higher prices for their finished products. Additionally, one-third of the respondents said they had been unable to obtain adequate supplies of some raw materials, particularly metals.
Reports from District manufacturers were somewhat less optimistic about the outlook for the general economy than about their own business prospects for the first half of 1988. Half of the respondents anticipated no change in the level of general business activity in the nation, while the remainder were equally divided between those expecting growth and those expecting contraction.
Although executives of financial institutions reported little change in loan activity in recent weeks, they anticipate increases in the demand for home mortgage loans and for commercial and industrial loans in the months ahead. Rural bankers reported that their banks were doing well and had bright prospects for the future. These bankers also indicated declines in the number of financially troubled farmers and farm foreclosures.
