The year 1987 ended positively for most of the Ninth District's economy. Labor market conditions continued to be favorable. Consumer spending was generally healthy, not crippled by the stock market decline as some had feared. Among resource-related industries, mining and wood products firms were quite active. Agricultural conditions remained stable. Only nonresidential construction appeared to weaken in recent months.
District managers of two domestic-vehicle manufacturers ended the year on an optimistic note, expecting 1988 to be as good a year as 1987. Both managers mention that truck inventories were low for this time of year, while car inventories were not.
Housing activity has been fairly normal in recent months. For the usually slow month of December, home sales in Minneapolis and St. Paul were a bit lower than a year ago. But some signs of a pickup appeared elsewhere in Minnesota. Residential building contracts in the state rose significantly this November, and the head of a builders' association says that most builders look to 1988 as being "a pretty good year."
