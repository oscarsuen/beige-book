Developments in the Second District economy varied among sectors during recent weeks. Consumer spending was stronger than many retailers had anticipated and the turmoil in the financial markets had little effect on office leasing outside the New York metropolitan area. Business activity was somewhat mixed, however, and residential construction was seasonally slack. Small and medium-sized banks reported no appreciab1e decline in the demand for consumer loans since the stock market crash.
Respondents reported over-the-year sales changes ranging from -2.5 percent to +9 percent in November and from +6 percent to +12 percent in December. An annual survey by the Retail Council of New York State, which primarily covers stores outside New York City, found an average increase of 5 to 6 percent during the Thanksgiving Friday to Christmas Sunday period.
Items in good demand were certain types of women's apparel, perfumes, jewelry, and other accessories while sportswear and electronics sold poorly. An unusually large number of foreign buyers was noted at several New York stores, attributed to the relative strength of most foreign currencies.
Despite the recent and continuing layoffs in New York City, District unemployment rates remain lower than the national average. New Jersey posted a rate of 3.9 percent in December while New York's was a slightly higher 4.5 percent. New York City's rate of 5.0 percent also was relatively low. With more layoffs scheduled in the City during the weeks ahead, many observers anticipate a negative impact on District unemployment rates in the near future. Since announcements of new and expanding industries have been made in other areas, however, the net effect on District employment remains to be seen.
The turmoil in the financial markets has apparently had little or no effect on office leasing outside the New York metropolitan area. However, activity has slowed in downtown and midtown Manhattan and on Long Island, and many observers expect vacancy rates to rise in the wake of continuing employment cutbacks at brokerage and banking firms. Citing this softening real estate market, five commodity exchanges recently abandoned plans to build a 65-story skyscraper in downtown Manhattan, and considerable uncertainty surrounds the proposal for a large midtown project which originally was to have housed a major brokerage firm.
