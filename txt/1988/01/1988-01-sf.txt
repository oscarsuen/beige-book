The Twelfth District economy continues to exhibit good health overall. Retail sales during the Christmas season appear to have registered modest increases, of about 5 percent, over last year's levels. Manufacturing, agriculture, and forest products industries continue to show improved sales, with much of the growth attributed to exports. Construction activity, however, is flat or down in many parts of the West, as builders wait for current inventories to be sold. Lending activity shows mixed trends. For most western banks, the number of mortgage applications is higher than it was earlier in the fall, but below last years levels, while installment lending is on a downward trend. Few bankers noted changes in lending patterns that they attributed to the stock market decline last October.
Car sales are reported to have been slow in December in most parts of the District, and many dealers have accumulated inventories compared with three months ago and with year-earlier levels. One banker noted strong demand for boat loans through late fall, although there was a normal seasonal slowdown in December.
Inventories are very lean in many export-oriented firms that produce paper, plywood, lumber, and logs. Drought-related logging restrictions have exacerbated the inventory tightness, so that log inventories stand at only 30 to 40 percent of their normal levels. The importance of export-related demand to these firms is illustrated by a major wood products firm, active only in the domestic market, which is experiencing just moderate growth, and is maintaining merely ordinary inventory production and inventory levels.
Many agricultural products also have seen strong exports in recent months. For example, wheat exports are up 25 percent compared with a year ago. Inventories of some western crops are slightly higher than they were a year ago, due primarily to higher 1987 yields. Inventories of principal California crops (almonds, cotton, rice) are expected to fall quickly due to the strong export activity.
Wine inventories are down, partly due to substantially lower imports, but also due to low grape yields last fall.
Applications for consumer installment loans also were below their year-earlier levels at many western banks. In the Seattle area, one banker reported installment loan applications up about 2 percent from last year which, although better than most banks' experiences, represents a marked deterioration from the 13 to 14 percent growth rate this bank registered a year earlier. Several bankers noted no discontinuities in credit patterns associated with the stock market decline in October, although a few argued that the October crash reduced loan demand dramatically.
