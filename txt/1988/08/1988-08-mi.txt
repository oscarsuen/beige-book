General economic conditions have held firm in the Ninth District. Employment demand has remained high, and consumer spending has continued to grow moderately. Recent rains should eventually help some drought-stricken crop, livestock, and dairy operations. And agricultural bank conditions, while not improving, have not yet deteriorated either.
District sales of motor vehicles have continued to hold up well. One domestic manufacturer reports that its car sales during June rose 17 percent over their level a year earlier. A district manager for a popular domestic line reports that car sales during June were strong at virtually all its dealers. A recent arena sale in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, went quite well. But district truck sales have slowed relative to car sales, perhaps due to drought-induced buying resistance in farm-dependent areas. Still, vehicle inventories haven't risen above normal levels.
Housing activity has held firm. Home sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area during May and June were 13 percent ahead of a year earlier. Residential building contracts In Minnesota were up 5 percent during May. But as has been true for some time, housing activity was stagnant in many cities and towns of Montana and North Dakota.
District tourist spending has increased sharply this summer. Despite burning bans at campgrounds, all tourism industry representatives contacted report increased activity. For example, Independence Day weekend business was way above the expectations of industry sources in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. A source in northern Wisconsin says that tourism there has beers running 10 percent ahead of last year. And the Black Hills area of South Dakota has also done well.
Crop insurance will help district farmers cover part of the lost output. Compared to last year, federally sponsored multiperil coverage is up 83 percent in South Dakota, 77 percent in North Dakota, 41 percent in Montana, and 31 percent in Minnesota.
More help has come from prices of farm products, which have continued to rise. Mid-July products of corn and soybeans on the cash markets were over 70 percent higher than a year earlier, while barley and wheat prices were up around 50 percent. These high prices imply lower government deficiency payments to farmers under current law, but some form of disaster relief might be enacted to replace that loss. Furthermore, farmers with stored crops carried over from last year will benefit from sales at these high prices.
Livestock and dairy operations have been significantly hampered by higher feed prices and a shortage of pasture growth. As a result, more stock has been sold than normal, which has lowered its price as much as 20 percent. Recent rains should help stimulate grass growth, though, and slow the sell-off in some parts of the district.
