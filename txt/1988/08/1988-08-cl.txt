Auto dealers report that sales picked up in the last half of June but turned sluggish in the first half of July. Some suggest the early July slowdown is seasonal and will be reversed in the last half of the month. Recent minor adjustments in incentive programs seem to be having little impact on sales. Dealers generally see no indications that customers are becoming less willing to spend, and one dealer reported that customers seem to be choosing more expensive models and options. Some dealers complained they have lost sales because inventories are too low while others expect to have difficulty clearing out some models at the end of the model year. Foreign cars continue to sell well.

Favorable exchange rates continue to benefit many industries in the region.

Improvement in the steel industry has prompted several large steelmakers to modernize and expand existing plants in the District.
