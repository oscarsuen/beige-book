Economic expansion continues at a pace varying from sluggish in two Districts to moderate or strong elsewhere. Employment levels are stable or rising, with tight labor market conditions noted in some areas. While retail sales are generally lackluster, auto sales have picked up. Manufacturers report moderate to healthy gains in sales and orders, although four Districts note signs of a possible slowing. Capacity constraints and shortages have developed in some Districts and materials price increases are widespread. Construction activity is mixed, with home construction reported to be weaker than nonresidential building. While the impact of this summer's drought varies, even within states, the corn and wheat crops have suffered extensive damage. The recent rains may save much of the soybean crop, however.
Retailers expressed mild optimism about the next six months, with those in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, Richmond and Dallas Districts expressing greater confidence in the future than merchants in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and St. Louis.
In marked contrast to general retail conditions, many Districts characterize auto sales as strong and above dealer expectations. Only Richmond finds car sales declining. Domestic makes, aided by manufacturer incentives, are said to be moving briskly. Foreign autos, by contrast, are reportedly rising in price and languishing in the showrooms. San Francisco finds inventories of unsold imports now standing at "unsustainably high levels."
Increases in the prices of such materials as metals, paper and food were widely noted. While a few contacts expect these prices to stabilize, more think they will continue to rise. Kansas City, Cleveland, Richmond and San Francisco report that shortages of steel, valves, castings, motors and chemicals have developed. Cleveland, Dallas and San Francisco also mention capacity constraints, especially in petro-chemicals and pulp and paper. In this environment, manufacturers are reportedly choosing to hold higher inventories and are finding it easier to raise their own finished goods prices.
Manufacturing employment is generally stable or increasing slightly. Cleveland and Philadelphia report healthy gains while Atlanta and Boston report recent layoffs. Most contacts foresee little or no acceleration in wage pressures. San Francisco respondents were evenly divided on this issue, however, and Dallas and Minneapolis noted some industry-specific pressures.
Reports on nonresidential construction and real estate activity were positive for the most part. Although nonresidential construction contracts were down from a year ago in the St. Louis District, office building construction has surged in some cities in the Atlanta District and leasing has picked up in New York. Office building construction has slowed somewhat in Chicago, but remains at a high level; industrial real estate and construction activity in the District has strengthened. Dallas reports that both nonresidential and residential construction contracts have stabilized, a development suggesting that a prolonged downturn in construction may be at an end.
Atlanta reports that demand for forest products has weakened recently with the slowdown in building activity, while San Francisco sees no such decline. Both are experiencing strong export activity.
With the price of oil below $15 per barrel in mid-July, Atlanta finds oil production slipping and Dallas and Kansas City report or expect a fall in the rig count. Atlanta and Richmond see coal output rising with help from the weak dollar and strength in steel.
Richmond bank executives report substantial increases in deposits in July; Philadelphia bankers have also seen a pickup. In the Dallas District, however, deposits and assets—particularly business loans—both continue to decline.
