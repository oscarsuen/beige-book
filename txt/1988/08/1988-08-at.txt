The Sixth District economy showed signs of moderate expansion in June. Expansion in key manufacturing industries was tempered by layoffs in other sectors. Retail sales have picked up and recent dealer incentives have boosted auto sales. While residential construction has slowed, nonresidential construction and home sales are strong in major regional markets. Tourism is benefiting from increased convention activity throughout the region. Recent rainfall has improved prospects for crops and livestock in many drought-affected areas.
Layoffs continue in the region's auto assembly plants, as well as at a large producer of military aircraft, and at Tennessee Valley Authority. Although defense spending remains under pressure, regional companies producing defense related electronic equipment continue to report favorable business conditions.
Plant expansions have been announced for the region's tire manufacturing industry as a result of strong demand. The carpet industry is doing particularly well in the replacement market. Carpet makers are concerned, however, that the drought may force them to cut back on their water intensive processes such as dyeing and finishing, possibly causing temporary layoffs.
Car sales continued to strengthen in the District in June and early July, boosting prospects that 1988 sales will be significantly better than expected earlier this year. Renewed incentives offered by domestic manufacturers have contributed to the improved sales experience, and disappointing import sales are intensifying competition across the board. Through May 1988, new vehicle registrations in the Southeast were up 6 percent over the comparable period in 1987, matching the gain in registrations nationally.
Declining values in residential construction in the District have been associated with moderate to strong home sales. Miami and Atlanta report strong existing home sales in June and early July, spurred mainly by consumer expectations of further rises in interest rates. In Louisiana and Mississippi, soft demand coupled with intense scrutiny of loan applications is making business difficult for homebuilders.
Demand has weakened in the forestry industry during the past month and prices have softened. The uptick in interest rates has slowed building activity but the home repair boom and increases in lumber exports to South Korea and Japan have provided some offsetting support for the lumber market. Coal production continues to rise but oil production has slipped 7 percent from the same period last year.
