Most savings and loan respondents report that savings deposit inflows have risen in recent months, reversing the weakness observed earlier this year. Inflows are expected to increase slightly in the near future. Mortgage demand has been solid, but most respondents expect weaker demand in the fall. Mortgage rates have been stable to slightly higher, and some respondents expect a slight increase in the second half of this year.
Deposits have changed little at Tenth District commercial banks over the past month. Although small time deposits increased at more than half of the responding institutions, demand deposits were flat to slightly down. Other deposits were generally unchanged.
In those areas most severely affected by the drought, however—especially southeastern Oklahoma, eastern Kansas, and much of Missouri—non-irrigated row crops are under severe stress, irrigation casts are rising, and range and pasture conditions are deteriorating. In some areas, non-irrigated corn yields may be reduced by half or more. Ranchers are providing cattle herds supplemental feedstuffs where pastures have been scorched. Although the drought has not yet forced the large scale liquidation of district cattle herds, net returns to cattle ranchers and feeders are likely to be squeezed by lower cattle prices and sharply higher feed costs.
Effects of the drought on farm borrowers and lenders will vary widely across the district. However, the general improvement in the financial positions of farm borrowers and their lenders during the last two years will likely allow most to withstand this summer's drought.
