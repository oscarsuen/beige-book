Farmers' have turned their attention now to the soybean crop which accounts for over 30 percent of District crop receipts. Some damage to soybean yields has already occurred but the crucial period of growth—from late July to mid-August—is yet to come. With enough rain during this period, further damage to soybeans can be minimized and a near-normal crop harvested. The drought caused some soybeans to be planted such later than normal, however, increasing the risk that an early frost could damage the crop. Cotton and rice in Arkansas have suffered only minor drought damage, with over 90 percent of these crops in fair-to-good condition.
The Mississippi River remains open to barge traffic, but travel times from St. Louis to the Gulf of Mexico have doubled. So far, the river network has been able to meet export commitments because grain shipping is normally slow at this time of the year.
