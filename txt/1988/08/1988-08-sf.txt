Growth of retail sales remains sluggish. One retail executive asserts that the sector is improving very slowly from its poor Spring. Another notes continued slow growth, but points out that retailers have been managing expenses and inventories very conservatively, and earnings therefore have held up reasonably well. Most respondents indicate that retail inventories are close to desired levels.
Respondents indicate that overall inventory levels are either close to or somewhat below their desired levels. Lean inventories are reported for sectors that are experiencing strong demand, including some electronic components and exported products, as well as minerals, valves, and castings that are in short supply. A few respondents note high inventory levels, but these respondents also point out that some of the inventory accumulation is an attempt to ensure the availability of products for which demand is expected to be strong.
The forest products industries continue to experience strong demand, from both overseas and domestic markets. Pulp and paper activity is particularly strong, and production is running at capacity. Nevertheless, inventories reportedly are low at both the user and manufacturer levels, so several firms plan to expand their production capacity. However, lumber production has been curtailed because of recent strikes at several mills.
In contrast, construction activity in Utah was so weak during the first five months of 1988 that it will take a remarkable rebound even to reach 1987's poor showing. Arizona is in somewhat better shape than Utah, but activity continues to languish there as well.
Most of those who anticipate steady wage gains argue that increases will be low due to pressures for keeping costs under control, expectations of weakening activity (as for defense contractors), or a trend toward tying individual compensation more closely to performance. Those who anticipate higher wages cite the pressures for wage increases that have resulted from recent high profits (as in timber), general improvements in economic activity (as in Boise), and difficulty attracting and retaining qualified workers.
While California is not experiencing labor shortages associated with immigration reform, some farmers in Idaho reportedly are paying day laborers substantially more than they did last year. Few respondents note wage increases associated with California's new $4.25 minimum wage, which went into effect on July 1. These increases occurred in such low-wage sectors as agriculture, restaurants, and hotels.
