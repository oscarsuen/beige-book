Among department stores, sales of big ticket items were unchanged according to about 50 percent of the respondents while one reported an increase. Half of the department stores said their inventories declined compared with one-third who said their inventories were unchanged. Nearly 80 percent of the department store respondents expect sales to increase in the next six months, while none expect sales to decline. In comparison, in our May survey, 36 percent expected sales to increase and 11 percent expected declines.
Prices of inputs and finished goods continued to rise at about the same pace as reported in our previous survey. About one-third of the District manufacturers said they had raised the prices of their finished products, and two-thirds reported higher prices for raw materials. Almost half of our respondents reported difficulties in obtaining raw materials--especially steel and chemicals.
District manufacturers expect their businesses to expand further in the next six months. About 40 percent of the respondents believe their shipments and new orders will rise, compared with about 15 percent who anticipate declines. The majority of producers do not plan to change their inventory levels in the next six months. One-third of the respondents, compared to about one-fourth in our previous survey, expect to increase capital expenditures in the next six months.
District coal production for the first half of the year is up about two percent from the first half of last year. Industry analysts say the decline in the value of the dollar and increased steel production has increased demand for West Virginia coal. These analysts foresee little effect of a decline in oil prices on coal demand because only a small number of domestic coal-fired electric power generators can be converted to oil.
In conversations with us, executives from several major Fifth District financial institutions indicated continued strength in their sector. Most institutions posted large increases in deposits in July. Generally institutions experienced modest increases in consumer and real estate loan activity through mid-July. The executives reported little change in loans for commercial construction, but the volume of these loans would have risen, they said, had their institutions not become more conservative in their lending policies. Bankers and thrift executives expect interest rates to hold steady or increase slightly over the next three to four months.
PortsRepresentatives from the three major District ports—Hampton Roads (Norfolk), Charleston, and Baltimore—noted general increases in export shipments for June over May. The import picture was mixed, however, with shipments reported to be lower at Hampton Roads, higher at Baltimore and unchanged at Charleston. All ports expect strong export activity to continue during the next six months. Compared to a year ago, export activity was outpacing that of imports.
