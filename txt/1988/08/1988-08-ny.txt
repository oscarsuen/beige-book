The expansion in the Second District economy seems to have slowed somewhat in recent weeks. The latest purchasing managers surveys showed slightly fewer firms reporting stable to improved business conditions and retailers experienced lackluster sales. The pace of residential construction continues below the year-earlier level and demand for luxury housing is down. Office leasing activity has picked up, however. Most small- and medium-sized banks have not raised interest rates on consumer loans since the prime rate increase.
Various kinds of apparel were cited as problem areas in recent weeks. Sales of women's apparel remained poor and sales of young men's sportswear were soft as well. In addition, furniture sales were down from a year earlier. Accessories, cosmetics and housewares moved fairly well, however. Inventories are comfortable for the most part, due to heavy promotional activity. Retailers do not anticipate much improvement for the rest of the summer but are cautiously optimistic about the fall season and the new fashion lineup.
Foreign corporations figured prominently in recent District developments. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held in New Jersey for the U.S. headquarters of Jaguar Cars, Inc. and, in its second major expansion project in New York in two years, Swiss Bank Corp. bought a 27-story building in lower Manhattan to house a training center as well as headquarters and offices for some of its U.S. operations. In addition, a Japanese firm announced that its new U.S. subsidiary will begin producing printer ribbons on Long Island, and a subsidiary of a Swedish company plans a $10 million capital expansion in Utica.
A pickup occurred in commercial real estate activity. Westchester County witnessed one of its largest transactions in the past two years when a communications company purchased a large office building in order to expand operations there. Elsewhere in that county, brisk leasing was reported at an office park which is under construction. The signing of several large transactions boosted office leasing activity in midtown Manhattan recently, and some signs of stabilization were noted in downtown Manhattan as well. Finally, what is reportedly the largest office lease ever taken by a Japanese firm in the U.S. was signed at the $10 billion Newport City mixed-use project under construction in Jersey City.
