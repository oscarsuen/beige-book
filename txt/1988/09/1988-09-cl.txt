Local auto dealers report that sales in the last two or three weeks have been slow to moderate. One dealer attributed the slow sales to higher interest rates, and another noted that buyers don't want variable-interest rate loans because they expect rates to rise further. Another dealer suggested that frequent changes in incentive programs over the last several months have confused potential buyers, making them more reluctant to make a purchase decision. However, dealers report that those who do buy show no sign of becoming more cautious in their spending and continue to purchase many options for their cars. Dealers are generally satisfied with inventory levels, but are prepared to offer discounts or rebates if necessary to make room for the 1989 models.
The new jobs appear to be slightly less concentrated in the services than they were earlier in the year. For instance, durable goods employers added 5,200 jobs in Ohio. According to industry sources, most of these jobs are in the smaller companies that supply the major manufacturers, rather than in the large manufacturers themselves.
Ohio's lower unemployment rate has not yet affected factory workers' hourly earnings, which have remained flat over the last few months. However, the liberal use of worker overtime by District manufacturers to meet production schedules has increased the average workweek by 0.2 hours to 43.3 hours, pushing average weekly earnings up $4.47.
A wide variety of commodities, particularly bearings, electric motors, and a number of chemical, steel, and aluminum products, remain in short supply, leading in some cases to price increases. Producers are coping by increasing their inventories of raw materials. The high volume of new orders and the steady backlogs of existing orders are expected to absorb this slight inventory buildup.
The metals sector continues to boom. Raw steel production in Youngstown, Pittsburgh, and Lake Erie regions rose 12.4 percent during the last three months over the same period a year ago. Although production has expanded significantly, upward price pressure is reported on many steel products.
