Only one-fifth of manufacturers, but over half of our retail respondents, said they had raised wages during the month. Meanwhile, some slowing in producer price increases was evident.
Employment in August was roughly even with that of July among our respondents. About half of the retail respondents said they had raised wages during the first half of August.
Prices of manufacturers' materials and finished goods continued to rise, but at a slower pace than was reported in July. The prices of finished products increased according to 21 percent of our respondents, and 61 percent reported higher prices for raw materials. The corresponding percentages in July were 35 and 69.
One-fifth of our respondents said they raised wages in August or expect to raise them before month-end. Most of these manufacturers said the wage increases were previously scheduled.
In our latest survey, District manufacturers were somewhat less optimistic about the outlook for the economy. For the first time in several months, respondents expecting a decline in national business activity in the next six months about equaled those expecting an increase. With regard to the outlook for their own businesses, 36 percent of the respondents believe their shipments will rise in the next six months and 26 percent anticipate declines. Producers who expect declines in their unfilled orders and workweeks exceeded the number who expect increases.
Corn yields will vary widely in the District this year. On the coastal plains of North Carolina, where most of that state's corn crop is grown, yields are expected to be excellent. In many other parts of the District, however, the rains came too late to help most of the severely damaged crop. Two successive summers of drought have Maryland farmers talking about planting more winter wheat and barley and less corn in the future.
Rising poultry prices are expected to help District producers maintain profits in spite of increased feed costs due to the drought. Cattle and hog producers also look for increased prices for livestock in coming months.
