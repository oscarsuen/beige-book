Nearly all savings and loan respondents report that savings deposit inflows are near or above year ago and month ago levels. Most respondents expect flat or slightly increasing inflows in the near future. In general, mortgage activity has been weak and this weakness is expected to continue through the end of 1988. Mortgage rates have been increasing, and most respondents expect them to rise slightly during the remainder of 1988.
The drought has also had a significant effect on district cattle feeders and ranchers, but drought-induced liquidation of district cattle herds has been limited. Cattle feeding costs have risen, and scorched pastures and reduced forage production have forced the movement of cattle from drier areas to areas with better grazing conditions. Development of winter wheat pastures this fall will depend on rainfall received during the next month. If wheat pastures prove to be inadequate, further liquidation of district cattle herds may occur.
Despite the drought, most agricultural bankers in the district anticipate little change in the rate of loan repayments from last year Most borrowers were able to rebuild financial reserves in recent years, and this year highest crop prices will help offset smaller crop yields. Most district farm lenders and borrowers will be able to withstand the effects of the drought.
