The Third District economy was still on an expansionary trend in late August although the retail sector remained slack. Manufacturing activity continues to increase moderately. Retail sales are flat compared to last year and merchants say the recent trend has been weak. Bank lending is moving up, particularly in business and construction loans. Bankers say personal installment and car loans are expanding but credit card lending is soft. Conditions in Third District recreation areas vary; business at seashore resorts is mostly off from last year while tourism at mountain resorts is up.
The outlook in the Third District business community is mostly positive, except in the retail sector. Manufacturers expect moderate growth to continue and they are planning increases in capital spending and hiring over the next six months. Bankers anticipate sustained loan demand, particularly from businesses, as economic growth continues. Retailers look for slow growth in the final quarter of the year but they do not expect real sales for the period to show any improvement over last year.
Specific measures of industrial activity reflect modest gains. New orders were increasing in August and a pickup in shipments is enabling area firms to reduce inventories marginally. However, order backlogs are unchanged and payrolls at local plants are virtually steady marking the first pause in employment growth—as measured by the survey—in 16 months.
Looking ahead, area manufacturers expect moderate growth to continue; 34 percent of the August survey participants predict improving business in the next six months while only 9 percent anticipate a slowdown. Overall, respondents expect increases in new orders and shipments and further reductions in inventories. Area firms intend to add workers in the next six months, on balance, and they plan to step up capital spending as well.
Area merchants expect sales to improve only slowly through the fall, and they are anticipating a final quarter that will probably just match last year's when measured in constant dollars. In line with a flat projection for sales, retailers are cutting back plans for new store openings.
Several banks in the Third District have mounted promotional campaigns to raise deposits with 1-2 year maturities, and these banks generally have met their goals. While most bankers contacted in August said funding costs have remained under control, several expressed concern that they will not be able to maintain their current rate of asset growth unless they can boost deposit growth further, and that this will require paying higher rates of interest.
