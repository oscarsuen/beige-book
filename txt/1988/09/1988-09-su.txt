The pace of business activity reflected in most District reports ranges from healthy expansion to stable or mixed, with weakening noted only by St. Louis. However, contacts in several Districts were less optimistic than earlier about the outlook. A number of manufacturing industries are operating near capacity, and further upward pressures on prices were noted. Retail spending is generally lackluster though some segments are doing better. Several Districts report weakness in residential construction, but home sales are strong on the West Coast and in the Richmond District. Nonresidential construction has slowed in various areas of the country, though industrial building has strengthened in the Midwest. Rainfall in the second half of the summer relieved drought stress to agriculture in several Districts, though parts of the St. Louis District suffered further crop damage from hot, dry weather.
ManufacturingActivity is expanding in numerous manufacturing industries and in most Districts. Rising exports and transfer of production from overseas as well as strength of domestic demand have contributed to manufacturing's rise. Some industries are at or near capacity including paper, chemicals, steel, and aluminum. Other sectors doing well include electronics; nondefense aerospace; and electrical equipment and instruments, particularly for installation in new plants and factory expansion projects. Demand for various types of nonelectrical machinery has strengthened, in some cases from low levels. Motor vehicle output plans have been revised upward in line with better-than-expected sales. San Francisco says that output of forest products is strong, though industry sources are concerned about weakening in housing. In contrast, Dallas and Boston report sluggishness in construction supplies. Other manufacturing sectors showing softness include personal care products and government purchases, including defense. Atlanta, however, notes an increase in shipbuilding to fulfill new Navy contracts. Apparel is mixed, with foreign competition still strong. Several Districts indicate that the overall manufacturing expansion is expected to continue, though Richmond noted somewhat less optimism among its contacts than earlier.
Construction of factories has strengthened in the Chicago District, and industrial park construction has increased in south Florida with the boom in exports. The pace of office building construction varies considerably among major cities. Hotel building is booming in Orlando. Chicago contacts expressed concern about overbuilding of retail stores in some areas. Boston described capital spending by profitable stores as cautious; weak retailers are selling stores. Strong or increased highway construction was noted by Chicago and San Francisco.
Ordering by retailers is described as conservative and cautious. Inventories were viewed as generally satisfactory in the New York, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts, but Dallas noted stocks above desired levels, and Boston District stores with weak profits are cutting inventories. Extensive markdowns were reported by New York and Chicago. Dallas noted reports of continued high square footage per customer, holding down profits.
This has been a "roller coaster" year for forestry, according to Atlanta. Increased timber supply due partly to the drought, and reduced demand reflecting concerns about lagging housing starts, have cut lumber prices.
Oil exploration and development is expected by Dallas contacts to remain sluggish. The number of active drilling rigs has fallen since May in the Dallas District but risen, contrary to expectations, in the Kansas City District. Atlanta reports new oil discoveries in Alabama and Mississippi, and moderately lower oil production in the District.
Reports on wage gains are mixed. Cleveland sees signs of somewhat higher labor costs, partly reflecting increased overtime. Boston's contacts are evenly divided between those who see accelerating labor costs, especially for fringe benefits, and those who do not. San Francisco reports shortages of entry and low-skill workers, partly tied to the immigration law. Shortages of qualified retail salespeople are exerting upward pressures on wages. In contrast, St. Louis sees no substantial upward wage pressures even in industries running at capacity.
