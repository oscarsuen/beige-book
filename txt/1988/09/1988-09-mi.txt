Ninth District economic conditions have remained stable. Employment prospects have stayed good. Consumer spending appears to have held up. Merchants contacted have not observed sharp price increases. Resource-related and agricultural industry conditions have remained largely unchanged.
Motor vehicles have continued to sell well. One domestic line reports that its newer compact cars are selling particularly quickly. A domestic manufacturer notes that compact trucks are also a hot item, racking up double-digit sales increases for the month of July. With production going full bore, consumers will wait longer to take delivery on special orders this fall. Analysts contacted report good sales in such diverse locations as Billings, Montana, and Escanaba, Michigan.
The most recent statistics indicate that housing activity may be slowing a bit. Housing permits issued in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area fell in June, dropping 14 percent below the number issued in June 1987. But 1987 was a banner year for Twin Cities homebuilding, with permit issuance comparable to Phoenix, Arizona. And Twin Cities sales of existing homes still rose above year-earlier levels during both June and July.
Tourist spending has continued to increase. Hot weather has helped attract tourists to cooler lakeshore areas. A tourism industry association reports a 30 percent increase in revenue for its members located on Lake Superior's North Shore, in Minnesota. According to local observers, tourist spending has been very good in the area around Pierre, South Dakota, and in the central part of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Forest fires are hurting visits to parts of Montana, though. Still, total tourist activity for the year in Montana has been high, and a newspaper editor comments that firefighting has brought employment to some unemployed workers and strikers.
