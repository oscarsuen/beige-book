In general, the Second District economy registered a modest uptrend since the last report. Business activity picked up somewhat and several areas reported either an improvement in residential construction or less softening than was anticipated. Office leasing continued at a moderate pace while the pattern of department store sales was mixed. Demand for commercial loans remained strong at small- and mid-sized banks in the District.
Over-the-year sales changes in July ranged from -l percent to +10 percent with most stores registering a net gain. Inventories were generally reported in good shape, due in part to heavy markdowns of summer merchandise. However, one respondent noted that stocks are somewhat higher at his store than planned. After about a year of sluggish sales of women's apparel, all are hopeful that the new fall fashions will be able to turn things around.
Unemployment rates in the District remain lower than the national average with July readings of 4.1 percent in New York and 3.6 percent in New Jersey. A midyear review of labor market conditions in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey area noted that the first half of 1988 saw continued but slower job growth compared with the last half of 1987 and much lower unemployment than a year earlier. For the first five months of 1988 the area's unemployment rate averaged 3.8 percent, down from 4.7 percent a year earlier. Thus, despite cutbacks in New York City's finance and manufacturing sectors, the predicted large increase in regional unemployment has so far not materialized.
Office leasing activity has continued at a moderate pace since the last report. The expansion of foreign firms was a major factor in both midtown and downtown Manhattan leasing, and negotiations with several other international companies are reportedly underway. In addition, some financial services firms which had earlier contemplated moving have decided to retain in lower Manhattan, where excess space has made rental rates and other terms more flexible. With little or no new office construction planned, vacancy rates in Westchester and Fairfield counties have either declined or stabilized in recent months, albeit at high levels. A modest slowing has also occurred in office construction in northern New Jersey where the overall vacancy rate remains about 20 percent.
