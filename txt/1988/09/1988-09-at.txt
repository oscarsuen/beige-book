The Sixth District economy continued its spotty expansion in mid-summer with key manufacturing industries very strong, but services moderating and construction weak. Strength elsewhere in the U.S. economy appears to be dampening migration, especially in Georgia and to some extent in Florida. Retail sales have shown renewed sluggishness, though recent dealer incentives have sustained auto sales. Homebuilding remains soft and nonresidential construction has been declining in major regional markets, where inventories of space are high. Recent rainfall has improved prospects for crops and livestock in many areas earlier affected by the drought. Selected industries are producing at capacity and raising prices but wage increases are modest.
The electrical equipment industry continues to benefit from the manufacturing revival as firms add production lines and build new factories. The electronics industry is being boosted by demand for personal computers and defense-related electronics.
Ship building has benefited from major new U.S. Navy contracts, which have also boosted demand for regionally-produced steel plate and increased employment rolls in Alabama and Mississippi. Steel mini-mills are prospering from new business stimulated by the weaker dollar, and Increased demand for can sheet has led to the expansion of a Tennessee aluminum plant.
Car sales were brisk in August, helped by moderate model clearance incentives. The August volume was lower than a year earlier, when bigger incentives strongly boosted sales. Truck sales continue to post healthy year-over-year gains. Though Georgia and Florida account for about half the region's volume gain, Louisiana and Mississippi are pouting the largest percentage gains.
Residential construction dropped one-fifth in July from June's level, mostly from a slowdown in single family construction. Reduced migration continues to exert a drag on housing demand. Multifamily housing remains overbuilt in several major cities, including Jacksonville, Miami, Nashville, and New Orleans. In Atlanta, multifamily building permits and construction are up sharply from last summer's low levels; there also is evidence of an apartment price war. Tampa's condo market is expanding.
Coal production remains stable while oil production is down moderately from last year's level. Oil exploration in the region has yielded new discoveries in Alabama and Mississippi.
