Industries in the Pacific Northwest report shortages of some raw materials and rising costs of those materials, although the cost has not been fully passed along to wholesale prices. Shortages of entry level workers are reported in a number of areas in Washington and Oregon. Moreover, shortages of low-skill workers are a concern to apparel and agriculture producers in California because of the immigration bill. Respondents also report a 15 percent increase in newsprint prices in Los Angeles, and a sharp increase in the cost of imported electronic equipment.
