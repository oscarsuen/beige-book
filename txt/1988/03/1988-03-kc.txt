Most responding savings institutions report that savings deposit inflows are up compared with a year ago, with some tapering off since the beginning of this year. Overall, little or no change in inflows is expected in the near future. Mortgage demand has been weak in most areas, but most respondents expect a pick-up in the spring. Mortgage rates are stable to declining, but several respondents expect some increase in the second half of the year.
Government farm programs will be popular again in 1988. Higher crop prices are not discouraging program sign up, and a majority of farmers in the district are opting for the basic 20 percent required set aside. There is less enthusiasm for the additional 10 percent voluntary set aside, and very little interest in the 0/92 programâ€”a program which pays 92 percent of eligible deficiency payments in exchange for idling all acres. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), however, has been quite attractive. Bankers report that in many areas most of the eligible acreage has already entered the program, and sign up is tapering off. In other areas, the relatively complicated requirements for program compliance have made the CRP less popular.
Agricultural loan demand appears flat for 1988, with both lenders and borrowers maintaining a conservative approach to agricultural credit decisions. A few bankers anticipate a limited increase in loan demand for livestock expansion. Some renewed activity in the farm implements market may also provide a limited source of increased loan demand.
