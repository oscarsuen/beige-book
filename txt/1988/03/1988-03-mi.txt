Despite slower consumer spending than a year ago, the Ninth District's economy held firm in the opening months of 1988. Labor market conditions remained strong. Although residential construction slowed, nonresidential building projects were under way. The district's wood products industry has been thriving, and the news for agricultural producers has been encouraging.
Scattered labor-management disputes were reported recently. The largest is between flight attendants and management of the district's major airline.
Sales of motor vehicles appear to be surprisingly strong, especially when last year's good performance is considered. In particular, one domestic manufacturer's truck sales were 19 percent higher through February than they were in 1987, That manufacturer's car sales were up a more modest 7 percent through February 1988.
Housing activity slowed considerably early in the year, but it may have picked up a bit in February. In Minneapolis and St. Paul, home sales were 35 percent lower this January than last, well off the record pace of March 1987. In the Twin Cities metro area, housing permits were way down in December 1987, dropping over 42 percent below year-earlier levels. And residential construction contracts in Minnesota were down 19 percent over the same period. One Bank director says that this slowing can be partly accounted for by the October 19 plunge in stock prices, which he believes has led to decreased sales of high-priced homes. But a leading Twin Cities realtor notes that the pace of sales accelerated somewhat in February.
Reports on tourist spending have been mixed. In Montana warm, dry weather has hurt some ski resorts. Adopting a novel approach to controlling state government costs, Montana plans to use state prison inmates to field out-of-state tourist inquiries. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, all indications point to a record year.
