Fewer starts on commercial projects in the Chicago area are expected this year, but most of the large amount of office space being built downtown is not scheduled for completion until 1989 or later, implying a high level of activity on projects already underway. Construction of Chicago-area industrial building is increasing, mainly light warehouse structures, after being very low. Strong leasing of Chicago-area industrial space is expected to continue. Industrial construction is also rising elsewhere in the District, including some new plants. Public works construction—highway, sewer, and water—will be strong in 1988.
