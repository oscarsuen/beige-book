Economic activity in the Second District has continued mixed. Retail sales were relatively strong in January, but a decided slowing occurred during February. While overall business conditions were generally satisfactory, demand for new homes and office space varied among areas. Business borrowing at small and medium-sized banks was somewhat spotty.
Over-the-year gains during January ranged from 9 percent to 15 percent and were reported to be on or above plan. Demand was strong for a number of categories including adult and children's apparel, accessories and home furnishings. Buying by foreign consumers continued somewhat heavier than usual according to New York City retailers. As a result of the strong sales activity, inventories were generally pared in January. Respondents described their inventory situation as ranging from on plan to 3 percent above. Some unwanted accumulation occurred over the first half of February, however, when consumer demand weakened.
The pace of commercial leasing activity has also varied during recent weeks. Demand for office space is strong on much of Long Island, due in part to last year's moratoriums on construction in some areas. Moreover, despite the fact that their vacancy rates remain well above 20 percent, Fairfield County and northern New Jersey have seen some improvement in leasing activity. In Westchester County, however, net absorption of office space has been minimal due to lackluster demand and corporate relocations and downsizing. Leasing has also slowed in New York City where a substantial amount of office space was recently added as the result of a merger of two financial services firms. Midtown and downtown Manhattan vacancy rates have risen and are expected to move higher in the months ahead. Six years ago the City offered zoning incentives to stimulate the commercial development of Midtown west. Since developers wanted to meet the May 1988 deadline for laying foundations, an additional 12 million square feet of office space is now under construction in midtown.
