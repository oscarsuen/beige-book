Reports from department stores generally indicated weaker activity than in the retail sector as a whole. Half of the department store respondents said sales declined during February, while 25 percent said sales had increased. Nearly 70 percent experienced declines in sales of big ticket items. Department stores also reported slight declines in employment and little change in inventories.
The prices of raw materials and finished products rose further, according to District manufacturers. One-third said they had raised their product prices, and 64 percent said the prices they paid for raw materials had risen. Almost none reported price reductions. In addition, two-thirds of our survey respondents who use imported materials noted price increases in these inputs since the beginning of the year.
Manufacturers expert their activity to continue to rise in the next six months. About 48 percent of the respondents believe their shipments and new orders  will rise—a proportion almost equal to the high recorded in the early fall of 1987—while about 14 percent expect orders to decline. One-third expect the lower dollar to boost their sales this year. Thirty-nine percent plan to increase their capital expenditures in the next six months—the highest percentage reporting such expansion plans since last August.
Coal production in the District during the first three weeks of February was slightly above production during the same period last year. Although the United Mine Workers contract expired on January 31, there were no reported work stoppages. Most union-affiliated coal companies in the District are operating under new contracts, although a few are still negotiating.
