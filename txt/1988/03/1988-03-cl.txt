Economic conditions in the Fourth District remained optimistic, exhibiting little change from the previous report. Manufacturing output and new orders continued to grow, fueled in part by continued improvement in exports. Employment growth in both goods-producing and service-producing sectors held unemployment rates steady. Strong auto sales contributed to a slight increase in retail sales, offsetting weak apparel sales.
Cincinnati realtors also reported a decline in the number of home sales in recent months compared with a year ago. However, new home construction in the Cincinnati area from October through January rose 10 percent compared with the same period the previous year.
The Columbus area housing market continues to show the most consistent growth. Home sales and new housing construction are reported to be above the levels set a year ago. The strong housing market is reflected in housing prices. According to a recent survey, house values in Columbus have appreciated 110 percent over the last 10 years, exceeding price increases in the other major cities in the District.
Reports from purchasing managers indicated broad-based strength in manufacturing. Nearly 50 percent of the Cleveland area producers surveyed reported increased production, and only 7 percent reported declines. Representatives from some companies commented that they are producing all they can, and a few said they are even looking for subcontractors. In the Cincinnati area, production was reported higher by over 40 percent of the purchasing managers surveyed. Only 16 percent said it was lower.
Increases in new orders and a sizable backlog of existing orders point to continued expansion of production in both areas. However, purchasers expressed some concern that steady price increases, key material shortages, and some inventory buildup may dampen this outlook.
Ohio's employment growth in January was divided evenly among goods-producing and service-producing sectors, adjusted for seasonal factors. Two-thirds of the new jobs in the goods-producing sectors came from construction, with manufacturing contributing the rest. Employment growth in the service sector was dominated by employment gains in wholesale and retail trade.
The average workweek of manufacturing workers in January dropped by half an hour to 42.8 hours.
In contrast, the demand for business and real estate 1oans has picked up. Real estate mortgages outstanding grew at an annual pace of 23 percent as homebuyers took advantage of falling mortgage rates. Business loans outstanding increased at an annual clip of 12 percent.
