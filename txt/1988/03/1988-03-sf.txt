The forest products industry reports strong prices and low inventories of logs. Respondents expect a decline in demand, however, based on reduced housing starts nationally. Pulp and paper production remains at almost 100 percent of capacity, causing sharp increases in newspaper and publishing costs.
In the mining sector, conditions are improved from year-earlier. The drilling rig count is above year-earlier, although normal seasonal declines are occurring and few in the industry expect further gains this year. Recent declines in oil prices have not yet had a significant effect on exploration and development plans, which included increased investment in Alaska. Metal mining activity continues to rebound in Arizona and Utah as a result of higher prices for copper and gold, reduced wage rates, and improved extraction technology.
