Recent economic activity in most sectors of the southeast has maintained the moderate pace of the previous reporting period. Regional manufacturing continues to expand especially for textiles and paper. The petroleum and coal extraction industries are reviving. Although retailers' sales are not increasing much when compared to last year, inventories are not excessive and auto sales are improving. Loan demand has turned up at commercial banks and tourism has posted healthy gains. The outlook for agriculture is positive thanks in part to government programs. Although commercial construction continues at a low ebb, residential building is improving in some areas.
A number of plants in the region's petrochemical industry have announced expansion plans for 1988 and are increasing employment. Foreign sales in that sector have been greatly helped by the decline of the dollar. Oil service manufacturers are expecting a profitable year due to the continuing increase in oil rig activity both on and offshore.
Fueled by a new wave of buying incentives, district car sales improved markedly in February from the weak sales volume in February 1987. Dealers are optimistic that the recent extension of incentive programs will continue to boost car sales at least through the end of April.
There has been considerable overbuilding of residential structures throughout Florida, despite high housing demand aided by the continuing influx of new residents. At the same time, Georgia is experiencing a decline in the housing industry's growth rate. January's single family building permits dropped 22 percent below the year-ago level.
The overall outlook for Tennessee is bright. The major exception is the overbuilt market in Nashville. Alabama's housing industry outlook remains optimistic due to the influx of high tech industries which are attracting residents from outside the state. Housing markets in both Louisiana and Mississippi remain weak primarily because of depressed incomes of residents; however, home prices in New Orleans have recently begun to stabilize because of improving conditions in the oil sector.
Southeast commercial construction, although emerging from its seasonal slowdown, is still being restrained by lenders who are requiring stringent preleasing before financing is provided.
Prospects for the region's agriculture continue to improve as the government's farm program pumps large amounts of revenue into the District. The export market for grains remains active as indicated by shipments from District ports. Both cattle and pork producers are enjoying relatively high prices for their products. Florida's vegetable and citrus growers are also benefiting from good crops and strong prices.
