The District economy continued to expand moderately, but indicators of future economic activity are mixed. Strong employment growth, for example, was spurred by gains in services and manufacturing. The construction sector, however, weakened. Consumer spending reportedly strengthened in February after a weak January, but bank lending slowed due to a sharp decline in consumer borrowing. The farm sector is in good condition for the coming crop year.
Home building and buying has picked up slightly from January, but is still well below year-ago levels. Refinancing of existing mortgages reportedly has increased as rates for fixed-rate mortgages dropped into single digits.
Preliminary banking data for 1987 indicate that farm loan performance at agricultural banks continued to improve. The rate of delinquent farm loans at agricultural banks fell from 7.0 percent in 1986 to 5.3 percent in 1987. The loan loss rate at agricultural banks improved, falling from 1.8 percent of all loans in 1986 to 1.2 percent in 1987. This improvement occurred in every District state except Mississippi. Commercial bank farm loans declined by 14 percent in the District in 1987; declines were noted in all District states.
