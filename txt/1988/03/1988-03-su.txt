Without exception, reports confirm a moderate expansion of the nation's economy. Strength in the manufacturing sector and continued moderate growth in employment are sustaining the current expansion. Consumer spending, which had provided much of the earlier stimulus to the economy, has continued to expand sluggishly. Auto sales, however, improved and have risen strongly in some districts. Construction activity remains mixed, while bank loan demand is generally flat. Consumer lending has declined sharply in keeping with the slower growth of consumer spending. The farm sector outlook remains positive.
Boston and Dallas find manufacturers' inventories generally at satisfactory levels, but Kansas City reports higher-than-desired inventories of material inputs. Of the six districts that mention manufacturers' input prices, most report price increases. Boston, Philadelphia and Richmond report generally stable prices for manufacturers' products. Prices of some products, such as paper and steel, however, are up sharply.
Strong auto sales are reported by Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis and Minneapolis. Other districts indicate that auto sales are on target or slightly ahead of last year. A number of districts find that domestic autos are selling better than imports because of import price increases and domestic manufacturers' incentive programs.
Three districts indicate increased oil drilling activity. The lumber and forest product industry and the West's mining industry are strong.
