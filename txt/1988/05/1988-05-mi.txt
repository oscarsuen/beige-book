The Ninth District's economy seemed to strengthen a bit in the first quarter of 1988. Labor market conditions remained favorable, and several components of consumer spending grew. The recent stability in agriculture was reaffirmed by many observers. And some positive developments occurred in the district's major resource-based industries.
District managers of domestically manufactured motor vehicles report that their operations again rolled up sizable sales gains. One manager notes that his year-to-date sales were up 10 percent for cars and 20 percent for trucks. Another manager reports year-to-date sales increases of 7 percent for cars and 13 percent for trucks. Inventories were no higher than normal.
In the first quarter, home sales appeared to fall off from their rapid pace of a year ago, but year-ago sales were unusually brisk. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, home sales were off 33 percent. The most recently available figures show that residential building contracts in Minnesota were off during February. A director of this Bank's branch in Helena, Montana, notes that housing starts in Billings were negligible, but another director notes that housing prices had stabilized in Miles City, Montana.
Bank directors also say the outlook for tourist spending is favorable. According to a director from South Dakota, advance bookings for summer visits were coming in at a good clip. Another director reports that tribal gambling operations in Michigan's Upper Peninsula were doing well. And a representative of this Bank's Advisory Council on Small Business, Labor, and Agriculture reports that its members expect a 15 percent increase in Michigan's tourist activity, and an 8 percent increase in South Dakota's.
