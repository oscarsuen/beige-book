Retailers continue to report price increases, although there was some hint of abatement in inflation in their reports for March. About one-third of our retail respondents increased their prices while 63 percent reported no change. In the previous survey, about 40 percent had reported increases while about half indicated no change. Moreover, 43 percent indicated that the prices of items they purchased had risen, compared with over half in the previous survey. Forty-four percent of our respondents expect to raise the prices they charge sometime in the next six months. The remainder expect to make no changes.
When respondents compared manufacturing activity in the first half of April to late March, they reported that the more recent period was not as strong. For the first half of April, more manufacturers reported decreases in shipments than reported increases. Likewise, new orders and the backlog of orders were weaker over this period than in March.
The prices of raw materials and finished products rose further in recent weeks according to respondents. Sixty-eight percent reported they paid higher prices for raw materials in March and about one-fourth said they raised the prices of their finished products over the period. Three-fourths of the respondents look for further increases in the price of raw materials over the next six months.
Most manufacturers expect their business activity to increase in the next six months. Half of the respondents believe their shipments will rise during the spring and summer, as compared with 15 percent who expect declines. Increases are also expected in new orders. The majority of manufacturers plan to keep their inventories at current levels in the next six months.
PortsReports received from the three major District ports—the Port of Hampton Roads (Norfolk), the Port of Charleston, and the Port of Baltimore—noted general increases in import and export activity for the month of March. Import shipments were higher at Hampton Roads and at Charleston but were reported unchanged at Baltimore. All ports indicated an upturn in export volume in recent weeks. When compared to a year ago, recent growth in export activity was outpacing that of imports.
