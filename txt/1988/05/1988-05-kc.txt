Crop growing conditions vary widely across the Tenth District. Soil moisture is plentiful in some areas, but inadequate soil moisture is threatening crop yield prospects in others parts of the district. Much of the progress many farmers have made toward financial recovery could be reversed by drought-shortened crop yields. Moreover, cattle feeding margins are being squeezed by continued high feeder cattle prices and developing weakness in fed-cattle prices. With current profit margins low and a market outlook that suggests fed-cattle prices may move lower, many feedlots in the district are now operating at below capacity.
