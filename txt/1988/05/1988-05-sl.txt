Regional manufacturing employment grew at a 4.9 percent rate in the November-February period, despite a alight decline in Tennessee. Much of the growth was concentrated in the production of electrical equipment, fabricated metals and transportation equipment. Growing export demand is responsible for the increased production of electric motors, appliances, consumer power tools and fabricated metals, with some plants running at full capacity. In the production of transportation equipment, growth stems from increased auto parts production in Arkansas and Kentucky and the expansion of auto assembly, which is due to better-than-expected car sales.
Exports of processed food products, including processed poultry and canned goods, have contributed to job growth in Arkansas. Meanwhile, after steady expansion last year, textile and apparel production is slowing as employment fell slightly in recent months. Some textile and apparel plants are operating at full capacity, however, and several apparel makers are expanding their productive capacity.
Farmland values in 1987 rose in all District states except Kentucky where they fell by 1 percent. Farmers have made early progress in planting because of favorable weather; farmers in Kentucky and Tennessee, however, are worried about possible drought. The District's wheat crop is good-to-excellent condition after a relatively mild winter. Cattle producers continue to earn profits while pork and poultry producers are experiencing lower prices.
