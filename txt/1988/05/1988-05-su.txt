Continued moderate growth of the nation's economy is again confirmed by reports from the Federal Reserve Districts. Manufacturing sector activity remains strong, with export growth a major contributor. Recent retail sales growth generally has been modest. Housing activity in most Districts has shown some recent improvement, but remains below that of a year earlier. Nonresidential construction activity is mixed. Conditions appear to be improving in resource industries, including energy where there is some pickup in oil drilling activity. Farm sector conditions are also continuing to improve. Generally stronger loan demand is reported at banks in a number of Districts.
