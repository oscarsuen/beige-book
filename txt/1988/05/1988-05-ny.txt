Developments in the Second District economy varied among sectors in recent weeks. General business conditions improved moderately and commercial leasing in much of the District expanded. Residential construction has been somewhat sluggish, however, and retail sales have generally been below plan. Small and medium-sized banks also report that demand for home mortgages has been weak.
For February, year-to-year changes in District retail sales ranged from -6.7 percent to +2.0 percent, results which ran from slightly below to "way behind" plan. Aided by this year's early Easter, over-the-year gains of from 3 percent to 11 percent were registered in March—results which ranged from somewhat below to slightly above plan. Despite the lackluster sales, inventories are generally reported at relatively comfortable levels as a result of close monitoring and some aggressive markdowns.
Recent developments point to some further strength in the District's economy. In Syracuse, General Electric has begun working on its almost $1 billion submarine combat system contract which the company was awarded by the Navy late last year. In the Buffalo area, Sierra Research just received a $100 million award from the Air Force for the production of computerized flight inspection systems with the possibility of additional support work later on as well. Plans have been announced for the construction of several large co-generation plants that manufacturing firms hope will reduce energy costs. A recent negative announcement was that Grumman Corporation will reduce its workforce on Long Island by 2300 employees as a result of losing a Navy aircraft bid. With Long Island's February unemployment rate at 3.3 percent, observers anticipate that these workers can be absorbed without much difficulty.
The pace of office leasing generally has improved within the District. Demand for office space in midtown Manhattan picked up substantially in recent weeks, but downtown Manhattan leasing remains slow. Elsewhere in the metropolitan area demand is reported strong. Some Fairfield County spokesmen state that a real upturn is occurring. The relatively few new office projects currently planned there and in Westchester County are generating some optimism that the high vacancy rates may soon decline. Hotel construction is one category in which considerable building is either planned or underway—most noticeably in Manhattan where four hotels are currently being built and four more are scheduled. Higher rentals, relatively high occupancy rates, and a record number of visitors are spurring this development.
