Economic trends in the Ninth District continued to be favorable this spring. Unemployment declined again, and consumer spending held up surprisingly well. Some important new construction projects were announced. The forest products and mining sectors benefited from increased demand. Except for excessive dryness, agricultural conditions remained stable.
Motor vehicles continued to sell well throughout the district this spring. The car and truck sales of one domestic manufacturer were around 10 percent higher during the first three weeks in May than they were a year ago. Another domestic manufacturer reports that its truck sales were up by even more than 10 percent during May. Smaller dealers in outstate areas have done particularly well this year, but sales at larger dealers in metro areas also surged in May. The rapid sales growth has left inventories a bit tight.
While housing activity this spring fell from its record-setting pace of a year earlier, sales haven't been bad. In April, the total value of homes sold in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area was only 6 percent lower than in April 1987. A representative of Minnesota realtors observes that the market to be "healthy across the board." Supporting this claim elsewhere, a reporter in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, observes that the city's housing market was "stable, but not booming."
