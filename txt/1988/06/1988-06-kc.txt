Nearly all thrift institution respondents report that savings deposit inflows are near or above year ago levels. Most respondents expect flat or slightly increasing inflows in the near future. In general, recent mortgage activity has been weak. Mortgage rates are reported to be trending higher and are expected to stabilize or rise slightly further in the near term.
Spring planting is nearing completion across the district. Corn planting is virtually completed and planting of other crops is on schedule. Moisture conditions have improved and are now adequate, following a period of drought stress for the spring-planted crops.
Respondents report that 90 to 100 percent of district farmers are participating in government wheat and feedgrain programs this year. Despite a recent surge in soybean prices, very little land was switched from corn production to soybean production. Farmers are likely to be very cautious in switching land out of corn production because that would reduce the acreage eligible for participation in future farm programs. In addition, planting decisions had generally been made before the sharp rise in soybean prices occurred.
