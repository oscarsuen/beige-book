The growth of the regional economy has slowed a bit since the beginning of the year. While most manufacturing industries exhibit strong growth, business services and trade are slackening. With the exception of autos, retail sales remain lackluster. Although residential construction continues to sag, nonresidential construction has picked up. Bank loan activity in May varied across the District but in most states modest growth occurred. Higher crop prices should help farmers prosper, however, the potential for yield losses from dry weather is increasing.
In contrast, most manufacturing, and particularly companies producing paper and chemicals, continue to report strong business activity. In the paper industry, price increases were noted in both kraft sheet from which corrugated shipping containers are manufactured and in chemicals used in the paper production process.
Car sales continued to be helped by extended manufacturers incentives and intense competition among dealers through mid-May. Domestic car and truck sales in particular are benefitting from the recent surge in buying. The first quarter's new motor vehicle registrations in the Southeast rose 13 percent over 1987's level. This performance represents a marked improvement over the sluggish sales pace registered in the first quarter of 1987.
In contrast, nonresidential construction has regained momentum in the Southeast this spring, posting a 3 percent rise in construction value over the first four months of 1987. Much of the District's increase has been in Georgia, which was boosted by Atlanta's 64 percent increase through April. Tennessee's construction has also surged ahead of last year's pace. Downtown office construction in Jacksonville and in New Orleans have led the way for their respective states over the last two months.
Bankers throughout Florida agree that loan growth was flat in May, but lenders in Georgia reported steady growth in total loan volume. Consumer loans accounted for the majority of Georgia's loan growth. Louisiana is the only state to register strength in business loans. Other states generally reported flat or declining trends in both business and real estate lending.
Lumber and building products industries are experiencing weaker prices due to the decline in housing starts in the Southeast. One bright spot, however, is a further decline in competition from Canadian lumber as price differences widen.
Oil production stabilized in recent weeks after falling slowly throughout the winter. Nonetheless, production remains down 5 percent from the same period last year. Conditions in the coal industry are stable; coal production is up 4 percent over last year thus far.
