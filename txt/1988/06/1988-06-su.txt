Most Federal Reserve Districts report sustained economic growth, but some note a somewhat slower pace of growth than earlier in the year. Manufacturing remains strong in most Districts, and export demand continues to grow. Retail sales have generally been somewhat sluggish recently, and construction and real estate activity have been mixed. In the resource sector a further pickup in oil drilling has occurred, but conditions in the forest product industry vary and the lack of rainfall is a concern in crop-growing regions. Several Districts report a recent increase in loan demand.
Atlanta reports that autos are selling well, while San Francisco has had strong sales of used cars but only moderate new car results. Cleveland and Kansas City found auto sales to be steady but not robust, while Dallas had mixed results.
Boston and Richmond report that factory inventories are at satisfactory levels, and Kansas City states that firms plan no inventory changes in the next six months. However, Atlanta notes, with new orders falling, textile producers find that their inventories are building. Most other manufacturers in Atlanta, and especially producers of paper and chemicals, remain strong. Factory employment levels are satisfactory or rising in Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia and Richmond, but St. Louis reports that, except for transportation equipment, all major manufacturing sectors have reduced employment recently.
Oil production has stabilized in Atlanta and Kansas City and drilling activity in both Dallas and Kansas City is above year-earlier levels. While Minneapolis describes a booming paper mill industry, Atlanta reports that prices for lumber and building products have declined, and San Francisco also notes some slowing in its forest products industry.
