The reasons for the lack of wage pressures varied. Some District businesses, located in rural areas, still have abundant supplies of surplus labor, reflected in county unemployment figures well above 10 percent. In addition, expanded automation has allowed some manufacturers to increase output substantially without hiring many new workers. A major appliance maker reported that wage pressures are not currently a problem, but could be in the fall, when union labor contracts are renegotiated.
Farm loan performance at District agricultural banks improved significantly in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in the last two years. The percentage of nonperforming agricultural loans fell from 9 percent in the first quarter of 1987 to 6 percent this year. Most District states showed comparable improvement.
