Manufacturers in the First District report that business is strong, in part because of a pickup in exports. Retailers experienced a slowdown in May but attribute the pause to poor weather rather than to any slackening in underlying consumer demand. Rising costs are a concern: Rapid increases in selected materials prices have pinched manufacturers and rising payroll costs may force some retail price increases. Capital spending plans are more modest than in recent years, but both retailers and manufacturers are optimistic about the second half of the year.
Supplier prices are basically flat, although imported goods and plastics show some increases. Far more troublesome are labor costs. While New England's tight labor market is driving up wages, insurance expenses (such as Social Security, workmen's compensation, and medical coverage) which reflect national trends, are reportedly rising even faster.
Profits are showing signs of slippage as a result of softer sales and rising expenses. Nonetheless, expansion plans are proceeding, though at a slower pace than in 1987.
Almost without exception, First District manufacturers indicate that certain materials prices are rising rapidly, even "alarmingly." They mentioned paper, petro-chemicals, steel, copper and nickel. Nickel prices have doubled since February. No one expressed any concern about the availability of these materials, however. Only a minority of respondents have been able to pass these price increases on to their customers. Most report that their own prices are up 1 to 2.5 percent.
Inventory and employment levels are broadly satisfactory at First District firms. Only a few contacts indicate that inventories are uncomfortably high. Employment is generally stable or declining slightly, reflecting productivity increases. While most respondents report "normal" wage increases, a small number think wage pressures may be developing.
Most manufacturers contacted are not engaged in expansive capital spending programs. The majority had made major capital expenditures over the last several years and have adequate capacity.
The outlook for 1988 remains very positive. Most First District firms expect a strong, even a "banner" year, although a manufacturer of discretionary consumer goods expects a "rough retail year." Two respondents expect a recession in 1989, but most are reserving judgment until after the election.
