Respondents report a reluctance to expand capacity by those firms facing constraints, although our survey found that most respondents continued to expect an improvement in total business investment spending this year. Manufacturers are reported to be retooling some plants to increase capacity, but are reluctant to make large investments. Several respondents report that manufacturers are seeking additional capacity through mergers and acquisitions rather than through new investment. Vacant plants in Idaho and eastern Oregon are being converted to new uses, and two aluminum plants idled last year have returned to production. Agricultural producers are using their increased incomes to reduce debt, rather than toexpand operation. Some investment is reported in western food processing plants.
Respondents in the forest products industry are beginning to note a slowdown. Shortages of logs remain a problem for small mills, and recent environmental actions are further reducing available supplies of timber. Concern about future demand also is mounting because of a possible slowdown in housing starts and a decrease in Japanese demand for lumber.
Mining continues to perform well, with increased exploration and investment noted in Arizona and Nevada. Energy extraction remains stable and above year-earlier levels.
