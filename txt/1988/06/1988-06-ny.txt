Economic activity in the Second District has continued mixed. Overall business conditions were stable to improved and office leasing activity was moderate to good. Retail spending remained sluggish, however, and demand for new homes varied somewhat among areas. Small-and medium-sized banks raised their mortgage rates following the May 11 prime rate increase.
Year-to-year changes at District stores in April ranged from -6.9 percent to +3.3 percent, results which were "well below" to "just about on" plan. Partial data for May show some over-the-year gains but smaller than were expected. Inventories were generally at comfortable levels, however, due to close monitoring and aggressive markdowns, though one respondent reported an undesired buildup.
As was true nationally, unemployment rates in the District were somewhat higher in May. However, rates of 4.2 percent in New York and 3.7 percent in New Jersey represented May-to-May declines of 0.7 and 0.4 percentage point, respectively. While May data for New York City are not yet available, it appears that, through April, the employment declines resulting from the stock market crash were offset by job growth in other sectors.
Several recent announcements point to continuing expansion in the District's economy. The Defense Department awarded a $236 million contract to a team headed by General Electric for the development and initial deployment of the "Star Wars" defenses. In addition, a number of firms are planning substantial growth and modernization here. These include firms making products ranging from radial tires and fiberglass insulation to aerospace and telecommunication equipment.
Developments in the District's commercial real estate market have been mixed. Office vacancy rates have declined in areas such as northern New Jersey and Long Island while remaining at virtually unchanged high levels in Westchester and Fairfield counties. Leasing activity has generally been moderate to good, particularly for buildings in desirable locations and of good design. The major exception is downtown Manhattan where leasing activity continues weak. Given the large number of buildings currently under construction in midtown Manhattan and northern New Jersey, however, there is concern that vacancy rates will rise as this new space becomes available.
