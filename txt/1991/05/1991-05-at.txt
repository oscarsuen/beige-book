Other producers, however, report continued declining or flat sales and persistent soft orders for March and early April. A telecommunications company reports no letup in its overall business decline and anticipates additional layoffs of a work force already reduced by 20 percent over the past nine months. Steel producers, auto-related manufacturers, apparel, and some apparel fabric producers have also responded to continuing bleak sales with further layoffs and have indicated there are no plans to step up output at this time. Paper, pulp, and linerboard producers also report continuing slow sales and are delaying capital expansions until economic conditions improve. A slowdown is reported in exports of poultry, grain, and coal, although phosphate exports show strength. District banks verify that current production levels in several industries are flat to down. However, bankers report that most manufacturers have dropped their "doomsday" scenarios, and, as a result, have stabilized or slightly increased inventory levels in recent months.
