Economic activity remains subdued in the First District. The retailers contacted report reduced sales in early 1991 compared to a year earlier. Although some retailers anticipate modest year-over-year increases by the third or fourth quarter, most expect slack sales conditions to continue. Demand also remains weak for First District manufacturing contacts; however, a few report signs of a recent bottoming out. While commercial and industrial real estate show no improvement, residential sales have increased.
Retailers continue to be very conservative in ordering inventories. Most contacts have been reducing employment in recent months, but about half note that it is becoming difficult to implement further staffing reductions without severely sacrificing customer service. About half the contacts feel that a lack of credit is hampering their capital spending, while the other half report ample credit for projects such as renovations and computer upgrades.
Input and sales prices are generally flat to down. The few firms that have raised selling prices on selected items have simultaneously discounted or lowered prices on other products; thus, their average price increases are 1 to 2 percent at most.
Almost half the manufacturing contacts have decreased employment from year ago levels -- by 5 to 20 percent; however, in contrast to recent reports, one firm is hiring and fewer than one-quarter plan additional reductions. Several contacts noted improvements in labor productivity.
Most respondents plan capital expenditures equal to last year's (generally low) levels. Two will increase capital spending -- in one case, very significantly because of a new product. Nevertheless, in the face of weak demand, a minority now expect to cut planned expenditures by 5 to 15 percent from budget.
Respondent expectations range from guarded to fairly confident --with caution prevailing. A majority believe that the upturn will not occur before the third quarter, but a few report that the national recovery has already begun. Nevertheless, most expect that New England will lag the nation and that swollen debt levels will weaken the upswing.
Commercial and industrial real estate, by contrast, show no improvement. Construction of new commercial space has nearly ground to a halt in the First District. Nevertheless, with employment in the region's financial institutions declining, vacancy rates are not likely to ease. Instead, office rents are expected to continue falling. Vacancy rates are also increasing in the Boston area industrial market.
