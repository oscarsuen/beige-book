Ninth District economic conditions have been uneven. Labor market conditions have declined in much of the District with the only bright spots being North and South Dakota. Automobile sales continue to be depressed relative to a year ago, though there are signs of improvement. Housing sales have rebounded, but housing remains below its 1980's levels. Conditions in manufacturing and resource-related industries have been mixed.
New car and truck sales generally have been weak so far this year, in some cases year-to-date sales were down as much as 25 to 30 percent relative to a year ago. As a result, several dealerships in the District have gone out of business. There have been some positive reports for the first 10 days of April, with one dealer reporting new car sales 10 percent higher than a year ago, and there is guarded optimism about the rest of the year.
Housing has been depressed in the District due in large part to the depressed market in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, with permits down 14 per cent in February relative to a year ago. (A recent HUD study foresees demand for new housing in the Twin Cities area failing by 2 or 3 percent over the next two years.) However, housing sales in the District were higher in March, with sales in Minneapolis-St. Paul 12 percent higher in March relative to a year ago.
Tourism activity has generally been moderate to good. The number of crossings over the Mackinac Bridge onto the Upper Peninsula of Michigan set a new record in January, up 1.2 per cent from a year ago. Tourism has been strong in South Dakota, especially in the Black Hills and Badlands areas. The popularity of the movie, "Dances with Wolves," which was filmed in South Dakota, and the fiftieth anniversary of Mount Rushmore in July are expected to have a positive impact. The outlook for the summer season is positive, especially with gas prices staying low.
Overall conditions in the District's manufacturing industries have been poor of late. An index of Minnesota economic indicators declined only slightly from its year ago level in January, however manufacturing employment in the state was down almost 3 percent in March from its year ago level.
The District's mining industry conditions have been fairly good. However, the oil business continues to decline with employment the lowest in years and drilling only in proven fields.
