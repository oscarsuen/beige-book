Developments in the Second District economy since the last report remained soft to mixed. Sales results at department stores were generally sluggish during February and March though some improvement occurred as the period progressed. Unemployment rose substantially in March and office leasing slowed during recent weeks. On the positive side, the latest surveys of purchasing managers indicate some pickup in business activity among manufacturers in Buffalo and stabilizing in the Rochester area. Moreover, homebuilders noted a substantial increase in traffic though sales remained soft. Most senior officers surveyed at small and midsized banks reported that overall demand for real estate loans in mid-April was the same as a year ago with the majority noting moderate growth in residential real estate loans.
Sales of furniture and other durable goods continued slow though one respondent saw signs of a bottoming out. High priced women's apparel also moved slowly but other types of clothing and cosmetics sold relatively well. The inventory situation was mixed. Some were pleased that stocks are below plan since sales have been sluggish while others reported more of an inventory buildup than was intended. All of our contacts were pessimistic about the outlook until the economy revives.
Office leasing slowed in the District during recent weeks as activity in midtown Manhattan declined to its lowest level in three years. Nonetheless, the primary vacancy rate in midtown was unchanged because of virtually no new addition of space. A sizable amount of newly excess space was marketed in downtown Manhattan, however, and the primary vacancy rate rose substantially.
Credit standards for real estate loans at the majority of surveyed banks have not changed over the last three months though a few mentioned lower loan to value ratios as well as more caution with respect to land development loans and home equity lines. All respondents stated that over the last three months their qualifying procedures for real estate loans have not changed and nearly all said that their interest rates on real estate loans have been "low and stable" or have declined slightly. Most respondents reported that the ratio of their real estate loans to total loans has not changed over the last year. The only one noting an increase stated that this was mainly due to purchases of RTC assets.
