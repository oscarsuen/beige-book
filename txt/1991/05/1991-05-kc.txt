Auto sales have improved slightly in most district states over the last month. Although adequate dealer financing is available, some potential buyers are having difficulty getting loans. Most dealers have been trimming inventories, but expected sales increases could soon lead to rising inventories.
Housing Activity and FinanceHousing starts over most of the district were up from the previous month due in part to warmer weather. Starts are above year-ago levels for most builders in the district and are expected to end the year slightly higher than last year. Construction materials are readily available, and prices are steady. New home sales are improving, but prices remain stable. Builders expect small gains in sales for this year compared with last year.
Reflecting the pickup in home sales, mortgage demand has increased in the district. Commitments have increased recently and should continue increasing. Mortgage rates have stabilized and are expected to remain flat over the next several months.
The prime rate and consumer lending rates are unchanged, and banks do not expect a near-term change in lending rates. All banks reported terms of lending unchanged from last month. Deposit behavior varied across reporting banks, but the largest number of banks reported no change in total deposits during the past month. Demand deposits and Large CDs were down slightly. In contrast, NOW accounts, MMDAs, IRA and Keogh accounts, and small time and savings deposits were up.
Despite the continued strength in cattle prices, little expansion in district breeding herds is occurring. Many young cattle that might otherwise be added to breeding herds are being fattened for slaughter in feedlots. Most district lenders are not encouraging ranchers to expand their herds. Instead, lenders are encouraging ranchers to maintain the size of their herds by balancing the number of cattle held for herd replacement with the number sold for slaughter.
The pace of capital spending by district farmers has increased only slightly from the sluggish pace last fall. Spending by crop producers is somewhat more restrained than spending by livestock producers, reflecting the continued divergence in crop and livestock incomes. Low crop prices and smaller government payments are holding down crop incomes. Strong livestock prices, however, continue to buoy livestock incomes.
