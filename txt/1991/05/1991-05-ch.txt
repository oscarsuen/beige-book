Several dealers expected improved traffic to translate into sales gains soon, and contribute to some improvement in their orders to automakers. Auto production is being spread around to more lines opening at slower rates, according to one industry source, which could indicate that overall capacity is being prepared for stepped-up production. Assembly schedules for the second quarter were left unrevised in early April, marking the first time since last July that planners did not cut schedules from levels announced a month earlier. One auto Industry analyst contended that the announced 5.5 million unit annual rate for second quarter production (still a low rate, but above that for the first quarter) could well be exceeded. A firm providing metal painting services for new auto parts reported that orders "ounced back" in early April. The firm's production is now running only 5 percent below year-ago sales, after experiencing production runs 40 percent below last year as late as mid-March. Steel producers also reported new improvement in orders from automakers in recent weeks.
Employment data and purchasing managers surveys support producers' reports suggesting that the District manufacturing sector remains weak, but that the rate of decline has slowed since February. District manufacturing employment continued to decline in February (the latest month available), but recent job losses have been in line with the results posted in the nation as a whole. Excluding Michigan, District manufacturing employment has been relatively stable in recent months. District purchasing managers' surveys indicate slowing rates of contraction. The index produced by the Chicago survey bottomed out in January. While the index continued to indicate contraction in March, some of the best improvement from January to March was evident in the new orders component. The Detroit index also improved from January to March, yet remained at a low level relative to the Chicago results. Most of the improvement in Detroit in March came from the automotive sector, described in the survey report as "desperately weak" earlier in the year.
Several reports by nonfinancial corporations indicated increasing difficulty in collecting receivables and financing inventory, but several small manufacturers reported continued access to bank credit A large diversified manufacturer reported that a growing number of customers are slowing their payments. in response to slower payments customers themselves are experiencing. A District auto-parts manufacturer reported that most customers continue to pay reliably, including one distributor who recently reorganized in a leveraged buy-out. However, payments from several leveraged auto-parts retailers recently slowed, according to this source. Outside of commercial real estate, difficulty obtaining credit appears to be concentrated in retailing. A large national discount chain reported that a growing number of suppliers are having difficulty obtaining short-term credit, especially for inventory. However, several small manufacturers in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana reported continued access to bank funding, despite weak sales so far this year. One small machining shop recently was able to obtain a bank loan for the purchase of a tool costing one-third of its expected sales this year, in advance or a yet-to-be released customer order.
