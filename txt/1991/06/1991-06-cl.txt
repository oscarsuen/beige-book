These economists are less optimistic about prospects for inflation now than they were in January. Overall prices are expected to increase at an annual rate of 3.7% in the second half of 1991, and at nearly that rate through the end of 1992. These forecasts are about half a percentage point higher than the panel had anticipated in January.
Automakers and dealers expect only a gradual improvement in sales throughout the balance of this year, despite the May increase in sales. Although inventories are lower than usual for this time of year, orders and production schedules for 1992 model cars are being held close to actual sales.
Auto analysts, however, believe that most of that industry's contribution to overall output growth will likely occur in the second quarter. Inventories of trucks are still reported to be excessive.
Steel respondents also expect little change in production from the recent 70% operating rate. Some expect a gradual improvement in domestic steel markets to be offset by softening in export markets. Correction of steel inventories is said to be nearly complete, and warehouse centers are apparently beginning to step up orders, but are hesitant to restock because prices might continue to slide. Some respondents note an erratic but small pickup in orders from auto and appliance producers, but not much change from capital goods producers.
Capital goods respondents expect that most of those industries are close to a trough at present. Orders for heavy-duty trucks apparently have emerged from a first-quarter slump, according to a supplier, with successive monthly increases in April and May. Orders for industrial controls show signs of bottoming. An industrial equipment supplier reports that his order decline has also leveled out, but no signs of a pickup are yet apparent. An office and machinery equipment producer cites a significant upturn in electronic components, although office computer machinery is still in recession.
Several lenders report more activity for existing home sales than for new homes. In some parts of the District, lack of demand and builder caution have dampened a rise in new home starts.
