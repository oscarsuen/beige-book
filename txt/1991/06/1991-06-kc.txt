Auto sales have been mixed in the last month, but dealers expect sales to improve during the rest of the year due to lower interest rates and improved economic conditions. Dealer financing is available in most district states, though potential buyers continue to have some difficulty getting loans. Dealers are either trimming or maintaining inventories.
Deposit flows at thrift institutions have been mixed over the last month. Deposits are expected to remain flat or increase moderately over the near term. Mortgage demand is generally stronger and commitments are up. Mortgage rates have been stable to down slightly and are expected to remain unchanged or drop slightly during the next several months.
Most banks have not changed their prime rates, but a few cut this key lending rate in recent weeks. Others expect a prime rate cut in the near future. Most banks did not change their consumer loan rates or other lending terms. Deposits were stable at district banks during the last month.
Wet weather has hampered the planting of spring crops in the district. Most of the district's corn crop has been planted, but planting of soybeans and grain sorghum has been delayed in parts of Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska.
Farm income, while down from last year, remains at a high level. Strong cattle prices continue to reduce the impact of weak crop prices on district farm incomes. Cattle prices may drop later this summer as an unusually large number of cattle in district feedlots go to market. Prices are expected to rebound quickly, however, as the inventory of cattle on feed returns to a more normal level.
