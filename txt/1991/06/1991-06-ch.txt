New car sales' trends remain difficult to interpret, according to several industry analysts. The 1990 switch from a two-turn to a three-turn strategy by automakers selling to captive rental fleets generated distortions to seasonal sales patterns. April sales figures (which under a two-turn strategy would include some sales to fleets) were understated by using traditional seasonal factors. Th higher level of fleet sales in 1990 provided a second factor helping to understate recent sales strength, as higher resale levels of nearly-new program cars substituted for new vehicles in early 1991. A major domestic car manufacturer estimates that after accounting for these effects, total light vehicle sales (including domestic and imported vehicles) have been essentially flat in recent months. Reports from several District auto dealers generally support this conclusion. One large District domestic car dealer reported that sales fell 20 percent in May from a year earlier, in line with declines posted in March and April. Citing higher auction prices, this dealer ceased selling program cars, which is consistent with widespread expectations that sales of these "nearly-new" vehicles will lessen in importance in the months ahead. Sales to first-time car buyers declined significantly, in part because basic demand was off and in part because first-time buyers fall into stricter credit-quality categories.
Several capital goods producers, whose sales recoveries tend to lag a turnaround in the overall economy, reported continued weakness in sales and production. A large District manufacturer of heavy equipment reported that sales continued to decline at a significant pace in May but the rate of decline has improved somewhat over the past three months. Orders in-hand remain very weak, however, off as much as 60 percent from a year earlier. Dealer inventories remain high and are expected to dampen the production response to an anticipated sales increase in the second half of the year. Another capital goods producer reported that sales of construction equipment continue to show sharp year-over-year declines, and sales of agricultural equipment in May turned soft again, after some improvement in previous months. A large diversified manufacturer reported that orders have been mixed recently, with weakness concentrated on the capital goods side of the business. A trick manufacturer reported modest improvement in orders for heavy-duty trucks, but medium-duty truck orders remained at recessionary levels. This contact noted that medium-duty truck orders usually improve before heavy-duty trucks as an economic recovery asserts itself, and attributed some of the weakness in medium-duty trucks to financial problems facing small businesses. A manufacturer of motor vehicle engines also reported that orders for heavy-duty truck engines strengthened in recent months, but production planning remained cautious.
