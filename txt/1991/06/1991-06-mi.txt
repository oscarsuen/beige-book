Although the Ninth District has continued to feel the effects of the national recession, recently there is some evidence that the region is rebounding. Labor market conditions have improved slightly, while retail sales have exhibited moderate growth. Conditions in manufacturing, construction, and resource-related industries have been mixed.
The state's average weekly hours in manufacturing at 39.7 in March, are still below their year-ago level of 40.0. However, March new business incorporations were substantially higher than their year-ago levels. Minnesota's April average weekly earnings in manufacturing was up 4.2 percent from its year-ago level, and up 1.8 percent from March. Employment in manufacturing in Minnesota and Montana was lower in April than its year-ago level by 2.0 and 2.8 percent respectively. However, it rose in North and South Dakota by 5.4 and 1.5 percent respectively over the same period.
New car sales in the District continue to be weak with dealers reporting sales declines of 6 to 11 percent thus far this year, relative to a year ago. Sales in May have continued this negative trend with dealers reporting new car sales declines of 11 to 20 percent, relative to a year ago. However, truck and used car sales appear to be picking up.
Housing sales have been weak in the District, due in large part to the depressed market in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. However, recently both existing home sales and prices were up in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Existing home sales were up 13 percent in April relative to a year ago, posting a three-year high.
Tourism activity throughout the District has been generally good. The number of crossings over the Mackinac Bridge onto the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was up 1.2 percent in the first four months of this year, and 3 percent in May, relative to a year ago. Resort owners in northwestern Wisconsin report that lodging reservations are ahead of last year and general inquires are 30 percent higher than a year ago. In Minneapolis, the U.S. Open is just beginning on a local golf course. In addition, the Wally Byam Caravan Club International, whose Airstream Convention brought in S million dollars to the Duluth region in 1983, has returned to Minnesota this June and July. Also, the International Special Olympic Games will be held in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in July.
Manufacturing conditions in the District have been mixed lately. An index of Minnesota's economic indicators rose slightly in March, but is still 0.4 percent below its year-ago level.
Conditions in the District's mining industry have been fairly good. Ranchers in the District have also been doing well due to high cattle prices.
