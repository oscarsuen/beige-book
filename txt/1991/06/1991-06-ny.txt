Reports on District developments remain soft to mixed. Sales results were very uneven among District department stores during April and May. Homebuilders are hopeful that an upturn in the existing home market will soon spur increased demand for new homes. Office leasing activity remains somewhat sluggish and vacancy rates have continued to rise. The May unemployment rate rose in New Jersey but edged down in New York. Senior loan officers at small and mid-sized banks reported flat overall demand for consumer loans is moderate to weak.
Due to tight monitoring and, in some cases, to better-than-expected sales, inventories are generally at comfortable levels, though one chain reported a level somewhat above plan. Contacts remain cautious about the outlook for consumer spending citing the uncertainties about the course of the economy as well as the possibility that May's strength may represent sales borrowed from June.
Office leasing activity has remained somewhat sluggish in recent weeks and additional space continues to be marketed due to new completions and further consolidations and restructuring. As a result, office vacancy rates have been rising in many parts of the District. At the end of the first quarter, the vacancy rate in the 15 northern New Jersey counties, for example, averaged more than 22 percent, up almost 4 percentage points from a year earlier. Over-the-year increases of 2 percentage points or more were common in several other areas such as Long Island, Westchester County and Manhattan. Vacancy rates in Manhattan are reportedly at their highest levels since the 1970s.
Most respondents have lowered their prices in recent months to shore up sales, but none plan to offer large price discounts in the near future. Half of the firms surveyed have reduced their employment levels significantly in recent months in the face of weak demand but plan no further significant layoffs over the coming months.
The April surveys of purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester showed somewhat conflicting patterns. In the Buffalo survey, 84 percent of firms reported stable to improved new orders in April, up from 72 percent in March. In Rochester, however, although fewer firms noted a worsening in April than in March, the 26 percent that did see a deterioration was still almost four times greater than in February.
The majority of respondents noted a slowdown in payment schedules for all types of consumer loans, though a few stated that the slowing was confined to automobile loans. However, most officers stated that outstanding balances are not rising and indicated that delinquencies are unchanged from three months ago. Several respondents noted some decline in the creditworthiness of borrowers due to high levels of debt, layoffs, and reductions in salaries. Nonetheless, two thirds of all respondents stated that, compared to three months ago, their institution is just as willing to extend credit for consumer installment loans.
