Respondents were optimistic about retail activity over the next six months. About half expected shopper traffic and sales to increase, but only a small percentage anticipated any change in employment. Prices at the wholesale and retail levels were expected to rise.
Manufacturers remained optimistic about business conditions and their prospects for the next six months, although somewhat less so than in our previous survey. About half of the manufacturers foresaw increases in shipments, new orders, and order backlogs. Respondents anticipated slight increases in capital expenditures and export orders, but they expected little change in inventories and employment.
We also asked retailers and manufacturers about credit conditions. A majority indicated that loan activity was sluggish in their respective areas. Most felt that a moderate number of creditworthy borrowers had been refused loans recently. Most also indicated, however, that loan demand was weaker.
