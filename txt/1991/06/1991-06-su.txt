Economic conditions appear to be improving modestly in much of the nation. Retail sales are up moderately in some districts. Manufacturing is gaining strength in some regions and industries, although several districts report weaker foreign demand for some manufactured goods. Prices are generally steady to up slightly at both the wholesale and retail levels. Home purchases continue to strengthen, but homebuilding has picked up in only a few regions. Mortgage lending continues to be the only source of strength in loan demand. Delayed planting could reduce production of some crops. Stable oil prices and low natural gas prices are keeping oil drilling in check.
Views of the outlook vary among respondents, with stagnation expected in the Boston district until early 1992 but healthy gains expected in the Philadelphia district for the rest of this year. New York respondents see no significant turnaround before late summer, while Cleveland and Richmond respondents are optimistic for the second half of the year.
Oil drilling in the Dallas and Kansas City districts has declined despite stable oil prices. The decline stems partly from low natural gas prices, which are down 20 percent from a year ago.
