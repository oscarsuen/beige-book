Developments in the District economy have remained mixed in recent weeks. September sales at District department stores were generally sluggish and homebuilders continue to report only subdued interest in new homes. Office leasing activity has been rather slow and vacancy rates remain high in many areas. On the other hand, September unemployment rates fell in New Jersey and New York following a rise in August while the survey of Buffalo purchasing managers showed a doubling of firms with increased new orders. Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks reported their willingness to lend is unchanged from three months earlier.
Showing optimism about the longer run outlook for consumer spending in the District, a leading French retailer just opened a large department store in midtown Manhattan and several national chains began operations in a rebuilt shopping mall in New Jersey. In Westchester County a leading developer is expanding a shopping mall and in the Buffalo area, two retail chains which are new to the region recently opened stores as part of an expansion of a two-year old mall.
Office leasing activity has been rather sluggish in recent weeks and vacancy rates remain high in many parts of the District. Asking rental rates continue to decline due to the abundance of space and various other concessions are also being offered to attract new tenants. Despite the recent slow pace of leasing activity, the primary office vacancy rate in midtown Manhattan edged lower as virtually no new space was added. The vacancy rate in downtown Manhattan rose, however.
The September survey of Buffalo purchasing managers showed a doubling of firms with increased new orders to 42 percent as well as a substantial drop in those with a decreased orders. The August survey of purchasing managers in Rochester showed a rise in the percentage of firms anticipating a deterioration of business conditions over the next three months, though by far the majority continue to expect the same or improved conditions.
Nearly all surveyed banks are now charging lower loan rates than they were three months ago. Three fourths reported unchanged credit standards, with the remaining quarter having tightened somewhat. Tightening measures included lower loan-to-value ratios, more stringent collateral requirements, and more comprehensive analyses of applicants' credit histories.
