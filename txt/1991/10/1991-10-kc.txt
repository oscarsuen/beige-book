Auto sales are down slightly from a month ago in most district states. Some potential buyers continue to have difficulty getting loans. Dealers are trimming their inventories of 1991 cars and expanding their new model inventory. Respondents expect auto sales to remain flat or improve slightly through the reminder of the year.
Most savings and loan respondents report net deposit outflows last month. Deposits are expected to remain flat or decrease in coming months. Mortgage demand varies widely across the district. Most respondents expect mortgage rates to soften slightly during the next several months.
Most respondents report decreases in their prime and consumer lending rates. Several of the respondents expect to lower these rates further in the near term. No banks report changes in other lending terms.
Unfavorable weather continues to plague district farmers and ranchers. Wet weather has delayed the cotton harvest in Oklahoma. But dry weather has slowed planting of the winter wheat crop in much of the district. Dry weather has also scorched district pastures, causing ranchers to feed previously harvested forages to their cattle. Forage supplies are generally adequate, however, because the spring hay crop was large in most areas.
District cattle ranchers and feeders continue to adjust to last summer's sharp drop in cattle prices. Prospects of further declines in feeder cattle prices have encouraged many ranchers to sell their calves instead of feeding them to heavier weights or retaining them for breeding herds. Meanwhile, operating losses have led feedlot operators to reduce the number of cattle on feed. These adjustments should trim the backlog of unusually heavy cattle that pushed cattle prices down, enabling gradual recovery in prices during the rest of the year. Still, cattle prices are likely to remain below the record levels of recent years, eroding the main source of strength in district farm incomes.
