Conditions in the Ninth District generally were mixed, but have deteriorated recently in the labor market, where unemployment rates were uniformly higher. Retail sales were fairly strong, but car sales remained weak, while homes sales turned down. Crop yields were mixed, and prices on most agricultural products were sharply lower than a year ago. Tourism remains a major bright spot.
District new car sales continue to be weak with domestic auto companies reporting sales declines ranging from 9 to 20 percent in September relative to a year ago, and year-to-date sales declines are reported to be even larger. However, truck sales have surged recently with September sales increases reports ranging from 15 to 46 percent higher than a year ago, though year-to-date sales are still well below last year's levels.
Housing sales remain mixed in the District. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, housing sales dropped 13.4 percent in September relative to a year ago, after rising in August. The September median single-family home price was up only 3.2 percent from a year ago. This continues the trend of the 1980's in which home prices in Minnesota have failed to keep pace with inflation. In contrast, housing sales were reported to be improving in North Dakota and Montana.
Tourism activity has been excellent in all parts of the District. The number of crossings over the Mackinac Bridge onto the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was 4.2 percent higher for the first nine months of this year. The American League Championship and potential World Series are expected to bring $6 million in direct spending per local game to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
Conditions were mixed in the District's manufacturing industries, with a number of firms reporting layoffs. However, in Minnesota's manufacturing sector, the August level of average weekly hours (at 40.8) was about the same as a year ago, though higher than in July (40.1), while the level of average weekly earnings was up 3.2 percent in August from a year ago. New business incorporations in the state were also up 7.0 percent in July relative to a year ago.
Mining has been mixed in the District. Despite substantial price declines, year-to-date income from copper, silver, and molybdenum mining was up substantially in Montana from last year. The lumber and wood products market is mixed, with problems due to environmental issues anticipated in the near future.
