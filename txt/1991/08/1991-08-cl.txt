Auto dealers report that car sales have eased since early July, which some believe was due to the heat wave of recent weeks. They nevertheless are encouraged about sales prospects for the 1992 model year, because initial orders for the new models are said to be at or above levels at comparable periods in the past. Dealers report about a 60-day inventory of new cars, with higher consumer and dealer incentives likely to slash the stocks of models in excess supply. "Nearly new" cars are still selling well and may be a substitute for new cars, according to some dealers.
Auto producers believe that fleet sales in June were higher than usual, and consequently are cautious about the strength of new car sales. One producer expects a sales pickup of about 10 percent in the second half of the year.
Auto producers acknowledge that new car production will not be a drag on GNP and industrial production as it was earlier this year, but are cautious about whether auto production will contribute as much to total output in the second half of 1991 as it did last quarter.
Production of major home appliances is on a rising trend, according to a producer, because sales to dealers have strengthened and inventories are being rebuilt following a liquidation in late 1990 and early 1991.
Capital goods producers uniformly expect a revival in output in the second half of this year, but some still believe that their business is in a declining phase. One forecaster will trim his second-half outlook for producers' durable equipment because industrial and transportation equipment production last quarter was less than he expected. Heavy-duty truck orders revived moderately last quarter from a 1991:IQ trough, and by year-end are expected to be about twice the level of the weak first quarter, according to a supplier. A producer of electric motors and industrial equipment reports signs of revival in that industry late last quarter. The worst of the decline in the construction machinery industry is over, according to a producer, but recovery has not yet begun because construction activity, except for housing and highways, remains in recession. Finally, a machine tool producer believes that the decline in orders is close to bottom and expects a revival in the second half of this year.
Steel analysts see little change from the current 70 percent operating rate over the next few months. Orders from the auto industry have picked up, but not so from the capital goods and construction industries. Steel inventory liquidation by customers is said to have run its course last quarter.
