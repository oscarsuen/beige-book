Auto sales are mixed across district states. Some potential buyers have to shop around to get loans, but adequate financing is available for dealer inventories. Dealers are striving for lean inventories even though sales are expected to increase in the second half of the year.
Most savings and loan respondents report increased net deposit inflows last month. Respondents expect inflows to continue in coming months. Mortgage demand and commitments are stable, although respondents expect somewhat stronger demand for housing finance later in the year. Mortgage rates have stabilized and are expected to fluctuate in a narrow range for the rest of the year.
None of the respondent banks changed its prime rate last month, or expect to change it in the near future. Consumer lending rates were generally unchanged, although several respondents had reduced their rates. No banks report changes in other lending terms.
The winter wheat harvest is complete in all district states except Wyoming. Overall, the district's crop is about a fourth smaller than last year's bumper crop, due to smaller planted acreage and lower yields. Yields vary from 20 percent above normal in southwestern Oklahoma to 30 to 50 percent below normal in parts of Missouri and Nebraska.
Reduced production of spring-planted crops is also possible. The district's corn, soybean, and milo crops got a strong start due to plentiful spring rains, but more rain is needed now. If the recent hot, dry weather continues, crop yields could be sharply reduced.
