Exports remain a source of strength for District manufacturers. During the first quarter, all new orders at Boeing were from foreign carriers. Small- to mid-sized communications, electronics, and paint-products firms reported increased orders during the second quarter. Foreign inquiries also have been made for the purchase of military helicopters.
Lumber industry conditions remain weak, with orders and prices slipping in recent weeks. Year-to-date lumber exports (volume terms) were up 2 percent through April, as a 37 percent decline in exports to Canada was offset by a doubling of exports to Mexico. Log export volume to Japan has dropped 32 percent, but exports to other Pacific Basin markets have increased 42 percent.
