Tourism and convention travel continues to do relatively well. Adjusting for normal seasonal fluctuations, contacts in Atlanta, New Orleans, and Orlando report further monthly increases in convention bookings and visitors for June and early July. The owner of an economy hotel reported that business "bounced back" in the second quarter and future sales look promising for that segment of the market since travelers continue to trade down in the cost of accommodations.
The remainder of the manufacturers have not yet seen any improvement in orders. A heavy equipment dealer, upon seeing further declines in sales early this summer, made additional inventory reductions. In Florida, a packaging company contact reported that June sales were down significantly on a year-to-year basis while a building materials manufacturer with excess inventory has seen no rebound in sales and is continuing to trim payrolls. Farm equipment sales have not recovered from their earlier depressed levels even though the weather has improved significantly. Grain and phosphate rock exports remain weak.
