Reports by individual manufacturers suggested continued gains in production of consumer durable goods, while reports from capital goods manufacturers were mixed. A large steel producer reported that its order book points toward shipment increases through the end of the third quarter (on a seasonally adjusted basis), and additional growth is anticipated in the fourth quarter as well. This contact cited strength in orders from auto and appliance manufacturers, while bookings from producers of construction equipment, agricultural machinery, and office furniture remained soft. A large electronics supplier reported that new orders gains, which began in April, continued through June. A manufacturer of paper containers reported that year-over-year shipment growth returned in June, after new weakening was recorded earlier in the second quarter. This contact also cited strength in orders from appliance manufacturers. A survey of printers indicated modest yet clear improvement in orders from District manufacturers in May and June. Heavy-duty truck orders softened in June, but only after an earlier surge generated by a price increase announcement, and one large manufacturer delayed a temporary factory shutdown for the second time. Several other capital goods producers, which typically lag in the early stages of a recovery, reported that orders remain soft. Sales and rentals of construction equipment remained weak. Promotional activity bolstered sales of agricultural machinery in the second quarter, but one manufacturer stated that diminishing earnings prospects have dampened farmers' capital spending plans, both domestically and internationally.
Commercial construction loans secured by real estate continue to weigh on bank capital positions, according to a recent survey of large District banks and branches of large foreign banks. Roughly one-third of these loans that expired over the past year were retired as specified in the loan contract. Most respondents expect the proportion of loans requiring renegotiation or foreclosure to rise over the next twelve months. However, most respondents had not yet committed to internal refunding of the credits scheduled to mature over the next year, and few contacts had purchased commitments by other lenders to provide takeout financing. Still, several lenders reported making new commercial construction loans in 1991, suggesting that at least some credit-worthy projects continue to find funding.
