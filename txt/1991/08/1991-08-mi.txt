The Ninth District has continued to feel the effects of the national recession, but there are signs of recovery. Labor market conditions have continued to improve, while retail sales have exhibited moderate growth. Conditions in construction and resource-related industries have remained mixed, while manufacturing has shown signs of rebounding.
New car and truck sales continue to be weak, though used cars show some improvement, and dealers report that their service departments are running close to capacity. Dealers report new car sales declines ranging from 5 to as much as 40 percent at some small dealers for the first half of this year relative to a year ago. However, recreational vehicle and boat sales are reported to be strong.
Housing sales in the District have been mixed lately. The depressed Minneapolis-St. Paul area experienced a surge in May, with sales at their highest level in three years. However, June sales were down 9.6 percent relative to a year ago, and 23.2 percent from May, with the change being attributed to a recent rising cost of FHA-insured mortgages. Home sales are reported to be especially strong in parts of South Dakota.
Tourist activity has been strong in the District. The number of crossings over the Mackinac Bridge onto the Upper Peninsula of Michigan relative to year-ago periods were up 3.6 percent in the first 22 days of July, and up 3.4 percent in the first half of the year. Bookings in Montana's Yellowstone National Park are up substantially from their year-ago levels.
Conditions in the District's manufacturing industries appear to be improving. In Minnesota, the total hours worked in manufacturing rose 1.4 percent in April from March, but was still 0.6 percent below its year ago level. The level of new business incorporations in the state was down 6 percent in April from March's all time high, but was still 18 percent above the year ago level. The medical industry is reported to be doing well, while the computer and electronics industries are holding steady, and the aircraft supply industry has slowed.
Conditions in the District's mining and lumber industries have been fairly good. Lower inventories of lumber have led to higher prices.
