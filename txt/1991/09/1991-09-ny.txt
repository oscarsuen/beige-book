Reports on District developments remained mixed in recent weeks. Relatively little new construction together with improved leasing activity resulted in a decline in office vacancy rates, and several areas reported a pickup in home sales, particularly to first time homebuyers. The August survey of Buffalo purchasing managers showed more firms reporting higher output and a substantial drop in those reporting lower output. District department store sales results for July and August were mixed, however. Moreover, unemployment rates in New York and New Jersey rose in August after declining in July. Senior loan officers at small and mid-sized banks reported reduced loan demand.
Due to tight monitoring and, in some cases, to better-than-expected sales, inventories are generally at quite satisfactory levels though one chain reported them above plan. Contacts remain cautious about the outlook for consumer spending, especially those who experienced disappointing back-to-school results.
Relatively little new construction of office buildings and a continuing improvement in office leasing activity have caused vacancy rates to decline in several parts of the District. The declines have been modest, however, and rates remain high in many areas. Leasing in midtown Manhattan during July was the strongest this year and the primary vacancy rate edged down for the second consecutive month. In downtown Manhattan the July decline in the primary vacancy rate was the third in the last four months. The planned merger between Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover is expected to result in a sizable addition of excess space in both downtown and midtown Manhattan.
The August survey of Buffalo purchasing managers showed an increase in firms with greater output and a substantial drop-from 41 percent in July to 18 percent in August-in those with smaller output. The percentage with the same or increased new orders also rose slightly. The July survey of purchasing managers in Rochester showed a sizable rise in the percentage anticipating improved business conditions over the next three months.
Most loan officers reported that their interest rates have remained stable and their credit standards unchanged over the last three months. However, a few respondents are conducting more rigorous background and employment verifications of potential borrowers. The credit quality of borrowers at the majority of surveyed banks has not changed in recent months.
