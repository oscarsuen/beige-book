Commercial real estate activity generally remained subdued in August, although the pickup in District manufacturing activity may be beginning to boost the demand for industrial space. A brokerage firm reported that rental rates for downtown Chicago office space continued to decline in the second quarter, with rising vacancy rates joined by negative net absorption. A large District cement producer tied to commercial construction reported continued year-over-year shipments declines, with little near-term improvement expected for shipments in the Chicago metropolitan area. A group of small commercial lighting companies anticipate a 3 to 5 year depression in sales for nonresidential building in the Chicago market. The office market in metropolitan Detroit remained soft in recent months, according to a brokerage firm, with vacancy rates continuing to rise.
Few District banks reported new tightening in standards for new commercial real estate loans in recent months, but financing generally remained difficult to obtain, with strict preleasing and borrower equity requirements in place. Lending terms have become increasingly costly, particularly for loan extensions. One District retail store chain recently completed a large equity offering designed to allow the retailer to internally finance its store expansion program. Previously, expansion had been constrained by the inability of real estate developers to obtain construction financing from banks.
Most banks contacted reported weak asset growth since the end of May. Each bank that reported weak asset growth cited softer loan demand, although other factors (including planned reduction in lending and securitization) were also cited. At the same time, most banks reported little change in standards for commercial and industrial leading in recent months, after more frequent indications of tighter standards being adopted earlier in the year. Weaker loan demand was generally concentrated among larger corporate customers, with banks noting several reasons, including lower financing requirements for inventory and capital investment, as well as alternative nonbank and/or capital market financing sources. Some reports of increased loan demand from medium-sized and smaller firms arose, with one bank reporting increased capital spending by smaller businesses.
