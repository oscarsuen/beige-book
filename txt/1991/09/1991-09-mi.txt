The Ninth District continues to feel the effects of the national recession. Labor market conditions have improved slightly, though employment growth has been weak. Retail sales have showed only moderate growth, and automotive sales continue to be slow. Conditions in the manufacturing and resource-related industries very mixed. Tourism was the major bright spot.
District new car sales continue to be weak, with one major domestic auto company reporting car sales declines of 15 percent in August and 22 percent for the year to date, relative to a year ago. Used car prices remain high.
Housing sales remain somewhat weak in the District. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area existing home sales were up 4.1 percent in July relative to a year ago, after falling in June. The June drop was attributed to a change in the terms of FHA-insured loans. The price increase of the median-priced home in the Twin Cities area rose 2.1 percent in the second quarter over a year ago, continuing the trend of the 1980's in which existing home prices in Minnesota have failed to keep pace with inflation.
Tourism activity has been excellent in all parts of the District. The number of crossings over the Mackinac Bridge onto the Upper Peninsula was up 3.3 percent for the first eight months of this year and 6.9 percent in August, relative to a year ago. Crossings over the International Bridge between the Upper Peninsula and Canada were also up 3.8 percent in August relative to their year-ago level. There has been a substantial increase in tourism at Mount Rushmore due in part to its recent fiftieth anniversary celebration.
The Minnesota index of economic activity rose to an all-time high in June, up 1.2 percent from May and 1.5 percent from its year-ago level. However, new business incorporations were down sharply in August, only slightly higher than their year-ago level, while average weekly hours in July were slightly below their year-ago level, and manufacturing employment was down 1.3 percent over the same period.
