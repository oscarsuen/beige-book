Looking ahead, Third District manufacturers are generally optimistic. Most of those contacted for this report expect orders and shipments to rise over the next two quarters, and many anticipate an increase in order backlogs. On balance, area manufacturers plan so hold inventories at current levels over the period. While most firms are planning to maintain steady employment through the winter, approximately one-fourth intend to hire more workers. Overall, capital spending plans at area plants call for only a slight increase in outlays over the next six months.
Third District retailers generally share a very cautious outlook. Most do not look for significant growth in sales this fall. Some noted that competitive pressures appear to be building as expectations for an early recovery fade; they point to deep markdowns and extended sales at some stores. In general, merchants do not expect solid improvement until Christmas shopping begins, and they hope to better the weak performance of last year. Nonetheless, some store officials indicated that they have not ordered aggressively for the holiday sales period.
Most of the bankers interviewed in early September expect loan volume outstanding to remain steady in the short-term. Some indicated that seasonal slowness may be obscuring signs of a pickup in commercial lending; nevertheless, most believe that a rebound in financing activity, for both businesses and consumers, will not occur until potential borrowers become confident that economic conditions will improve soon.
