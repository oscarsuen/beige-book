Durable goods have shown little improvement, with home furnishings especially weak. General department store traffic declined modestly from this spring and early summer. Upscale department stores report lower back-to-school sales from one year ago. However, sales at stores emphasizing discount pricing expanded, as consumers continued to substitute away from more expensive selections. Retailers are expecting little, if any, increase in holiday sales from last year.
New car sales weakened in August after moderate improvements over the summer. However, used car sales continued to strengthen; contacts attributed this to consumer cost-consciousness and credit constraints. Dealers have been conservative in ordering 1992 models. To counter announced price increases and expected consumer reluctance, rebate programs are reportedly under development.
Tourism in the region improved moderately during August compared with year-ago levels. Modest increases in convention bookings and visitors were reported in Atlanta, New Orleans, and Orlando. Based on advance bookings, convention attendance should continue to improve through the fail.
Other manufacturers expect little improvement until next year. Automobile and building materials shipments continue to slump. Weak commercial construction continues to adversely impact the region's structural metal production. Sluggish construction and auto activity is expected to restrain demand for related chemical production through early next year. New layoffs continue to be reported at electronic equipment producers affected by declining defense contracts.
New home inventories are declining, but builders report that modest demand and tight credit standards continue to limit speculative development. Contacts expect no improvement in nonresidential construction during the remainder of this year.
Generally, labor availability is not a problem. Our contacts anticipate no acceleration of wage pressures over the next several months. Budgeted wage gains are equal to or slightly below those seen last year at this time. The major exception continues to be health services. According to one contact, new medical technology requires more highly skilled labor and a relative scarcity of skilled technicians continues to exert pressure on wages in that sector. Escalation of benefits costs continues to trouble employers, who are implementing increasingly aggressive policies to curtail these costs.
