Economic activity in the First District has not improved noticeably. Most retailers report fairly flat sales in July and August compared to a year ago, but some experienced greater weakness or a deteriorating trend during this period. Although a majority of First District manufacturers surveyed express disappointment that sales and orders continue below year-ago levels, one-third see a glimmer of hope in incoming business. Nevertheless, most contacts expect no significant upturn in economic activity until the first or second quarter of 1992.
Several contacts indicate a concern about future earnings, given their expectations that continuing job losses will deter consumer spending. At best, they expect modest increases in sales in 1992. Contacts generally believe that their own success in paring down inventories will reduce the pressure to lower selling prices. However, they anticipate heightened competition as a result of discounting by weaker competitors and new market entrants. They note that it will be hard to reduce expenses further because they have already cut staffing from last year's levels, and because capital budgets are already minimal. Other expenses -- such as taxes, workers' compensation, insurance, and rents -- are beyond their control.
At most manufacturers contacted, the workforce is below year-ago levels, by 2 to 15 percent. Some firms have also reduced hours worked. One-third plan further cuts in employment, generally through attrition.
Over half of the respondents have reduced 1991 capital spending below 1990 levels and below plan. Several report that spending is now less than depreciation. Only two firms are expanding capacity for specific products.
Input prices are generally described as stable, rather than declining as they were previously. All of the manufacturers surveyed report that their own sales prices are flat or falling. Several firms complain of a squeeze on their profit margins.
Although a few contacts report tentative upticks, most see no clear indication that the recession has ended. Indeed, a majority expect the "tough sledding" to continue through the first or second quarter of 1992. Because they cannot see a potential source of significant growth, they expect the recovery to be very slow.
The consensus among real estate contacts is that competition among banks for residential mortgages has made rates very attractive. By contrast, sharp declines in residential rents have made credit for investments in condominiums and other multifamily residential property difficult to obtain.
