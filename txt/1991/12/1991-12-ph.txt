According to most indications, economic activity in the Third District was easing in early November, although there were some positive developments. Manufacturers reported a dip in business and continuing reductions in employment. Retailers noted an upturn in sales, but they said extensive discounting was necessary to prompt the improvement. Bankers said the downward trend in overall loan volume was continuing although they reported a recent increase in residential mortgage lending for both home purchases and refinancings.
Recent developments have not altered the outlook among most contacts in the Third District business community. Manufacturers are still optimistic that business will improve over the next six months. Retailers forecast only slim year-over-year gains in the dollar value of sales for the Christmas shopping season. Several commercial bankers said they believe commercial and industrial lending may pick up by the middle of next year. This represents a more optimistic view for this lending category than the forecasts bankers made earlier this fall. For consumer lending, bankers expect some modest gains as the economy recovers; but they plan to maintain limits on commercial real estate lending.
Despite the dip in activity in November, most manufacturers in the Third District are optimistic that business will pick up over the next six months. A majority of those polled for this report forecast increases in shipments and orders by next spring. While most intend to hold the line on employment over the period, more than one-fourth plan to add to their work forces.
Most of the store executives contacted for this report were holding to their earlier forecasts for the Christmas shopping season despite the recent upturn in sales. These forecasts call for gains in the range of 3 to 5 percent over last year in dollar sales. With most merchants concerned that extensive discounting will have to be maintained through the end of the year, few expect operating profits to improve significantly.
Several bankers said that discussions with their business customers led them to believe that commercial and industrial lending will increase near the end of the second quarter of next year as area businesses step up capital spending. For other credit categories, bankers generally see slow growth in consumer lending next year as confidence in a recovery gradually increases, but they expect to maintain limits on commercial real estate lending.
