None of the auto dealers contacted reported improvement in sales from previous months' or year-ago levels even with the arrival of new 1992 models. Most saw flat year-over-year sales.
More positively, a producer of printed materials for food packaging has seen strength in new orders and production over year-ago levels and is currently planning a major capital expansion project. Several food processors also report increased new orders and shipments. Another producer of paper products and boxes expects currently slowing orders to stabilize in the first quarter of next year. Most contacts continue to carry lean inventories, and have no plans for additional inventory accumulation.
On the other hand, one banker said that his institution may have tightened credit standards too much and was losing market share as a result. Auto dealers and construction contractors continue to report that credit is difficult to obtain.
The commercial real estate market has shown little change in this reporting period. Commercial office space remains overbuilt in many cities, with effective rental rates depressed, and little or no improvement in absorption. Corporate consolidations and mergers continue to put additional supply on the market and our contacts are generally unsure whether it has hit bottom.
