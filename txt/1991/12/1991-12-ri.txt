Almost half of the retailers surveyed believed that the recession had not yet bottomed out in their areas; however, they remained optimistic about retail activity for the next six months. Respondents expected sales, capital expenditures and shopper traffic to rise, employment to be stable, and inventories to be unchanged. Most retailers anticipated that wholesale and retail prices would increase over the period.
In their responses to our special telephone survey, District retailers expressed less optimism about sales in the weeks immediately ahead. Most said they would be pleased of this year's Christmas sales merely matched last year's. Several retailers reported that they had started their seasonal sales promotions about two weeks earlier than usual, and a number indicated that they might offer discounts for the first time. Generally, retailers who planned to offer discounts were counting on higher sales volumes to offset lower profit margins. They indicated that they were trying to limit their inventories while still offering a wide selection of merchandise.
Looking ahead, however, manufacturers remained optimistic about general business conditions and about their prospects for the next six months. Almost half foresaw increases in shipments and new orders, and few expected decreases. A majority of respondents also anticipated increases in most other production indicators except inventories.
