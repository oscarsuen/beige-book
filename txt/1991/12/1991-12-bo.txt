Economic activity has not revived in the First District, but results are more varied than in recent months. A majority of retail contacts describe sales as level or rising slightly, but some report continued deterioration. Retailers foresee consumer skittishness and bargain-hunting combining to make the Christmas season very competitive. Manufacturing contacts also report mixed signals. At least half see recurring weakness in new orders and further cuts in employment. Yet, several describe new initiatives and plan increased capital spending. They expect no upturn in economic activity until mid-1992.
Several retailers note that stimulating consumer demand now requires discounts. The cautious buying pace is attributed to concerns about employment stability as well as to consumers' expectations that anxious retailers will cut prices further. This downward pressure on prices has meant that margins remain thin despite the minor uptick in sales. Thus, profits are unchanged, and retailers complain that they will increase only with further cost reductions.
Most retailers see few remaining opportunities for cost cutting. In all but one case, capital budgets are slim to nonexistent. With few exceptions, wages are not increasing. Most retailers will conduct typical seasonal hiring, although one plans further staff reductions. All expect an extremely competitive Christmas.
Most contacts report that employment is below year-ago levels; in a few cases it has been stable since summer. Several firms have used part-time schedules, furloughs, salary cuts, and delayed pay increases to reduce labor costs. Over half of those surveyed expect further employment reductions--in two cases in response to unwelcome increases in inventories. Two firms plan modest hiring.
At half of the manufacturing firms surveyed, capital spending is currently below budget, in some cases by as much as 30 to 50 percent. Next year, however, half expect to increase investment from its 1991 level. Some of the plans involve new or replacement facilities and require substantial increases in spending. A few firms are introducing new producing others are trying new marketing efforts.
First District manufacturing contacts have budgeted 1992 sales growth at the current or a slightly improved pace. They expect some pickup in economic activity around mid-year, but, over the medium term, foresee a long, slow haul.
