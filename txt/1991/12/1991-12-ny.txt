Reports on District developments remained mixed. October sales results at department stores were fairly evenly divided between those with sales above and below year-ago levels. District unemployment rates rose in October reversing September declines. The October purchasing managers' surveys indicated that business conditions stabilized in Rochester while deteriorating somewhat in Buffalo. Although residential construction continues sluggish, there has been some increased demand for existing homes and office space in several areas. Senior loan officers at small and midsized banks said their willingness to lend was unchanged from three months earlier.
Inventories are reported to be in good shape and intentionally below year-earlier levels in some cases. District retailers do not anticipate large year-to-year gains for the rest of the fourth quarter in light of the sluggish economy and surveys showing continued reluctance to spend on the part of consumers.
Office leasing activity improved in parts of the District but vacancy rates moved in varying directions. Vacancy rates moved up in midtown Manhattan and Westchester County, largely as a result of corporate relocations and restructuring, while northern New Jersey's rate increased due to the completion of several new office buildings. By contrast, Fairfield County, Connecticut recently experienced a decline of almost a percentage point in its vacancy rate as a result of strong leasing activity and rates in downtown Manhattan and on Long Island showed virtually no change. Overall, office vacancy rates remain at high levels in much of the District.
The Rochester and Buffalo surveys of purchasing managers showed differing results in October. General business conditions stabilized in Rochester where surveyed firms reported business conditions similar to those in September. The 32 percent of firms reporting an improvement was double the number reporting a worsening. In Buffalo, however, some deterioration occurred as the percentages with lower production and fewer new orders more than doubled. Nonetheless, by far the majority of firms in both areas reported stable to improved conditions.
Nearly all loan officers are now charging lower loan rates than they were three months ago, reflecting decreases in the prime rate. With the decline in interest rates has come an increase in mortgage refinancing. Credit standards at all banks surveyed have not changed over the past three months. Although delinquency rates in general have increased over recent months, delinquencies on commercial and industrial loans and on nonresidential mortgages have remained stable. Slightly less than half of surveyed officers reported a rise in consumer loan delinquencies.
