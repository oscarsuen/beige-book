New car sales remained depressed. A District supplier of financial services to car dealers reported that business at most dealerships has continually slowed in recent months. Floor traffic weakened further and was joined by a new softening in the interest level of potential buyers. Car sales in the Midwest have been hit almost as hard as the national average, according to this contact. One of the largest auto dealers in the District reported that sales have been running at half the rate experienced during the summer and early fall, and stated that his experience was repeated for most dealerships in his market area. Another dealer reported that leasing, as well as sales have softened in recent weeks, noting that "used car sales are keeping us afloat." A dealer of a relatively strong selling model indicated that new business has been softer than projected.
Purchasing manager surveys have been indicating continued expansion by a slimming majority of District manufacturers in the past two months. The overall index produced by the Chicago survey dropped from a seasonally adjusted 56.2 percent in October to 52.7 percent in November. The picture of slowing but continued growth was generally echoed in recent results for Detroit, Indianapolis, and Southwest Michigan, while the October results for Milwaukee showed conditions improving. Reports from individual manufacturers were mixed. A steel manufacturer reported that industry shipments are now expected to decline from the third quarter to the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis. A manufacturer of electronic connectors stated that the firm continues to cut costs, because the U.S. market remains sluggish. A brighter picture was offered by a large manufacturer of industrial machinery, who reported that domestic orders have begun to show some improvement on a month-to-month basis, after consistently reporting sluggish conditions during the summer and early fall. Several contacts report that exports and sales by foreign subsidiaries continued to outperform domestic sales.
Livestock prices have weakened considerably this fall due to evidence of an upturn in red meat production. The expansion now underway among hog farmers in District states and nationwide suggests that per capita pork production in 1991 will be up 7 percent and the largest since 1981. On a more positive note for farm earnings, the distressed conditions among dairy farmers over the past year have eased somewhat as production has leveled-off and milk prices have moved back up above the retreating levels of a year ago.
