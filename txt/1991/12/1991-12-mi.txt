Labor market conditions in the District were mixed, with the western states showing signs of strength, while the rest of the District continued to be depressed. Retail sales in areas which haven't benefited from the continuing influx of Canadian shoppers stayed stagnant, while new car sales remained in the doldrums. Tourism has generally been excellent this year and looks promising for the winter as well. Crop yields in the District, with the exception of Minnesota, have been generally good, though farm prices have been mixed.
New car sales in the District continue to be weak, with local dealers reporting substantial declines. Even floor traffic on dealer showrooms remains slow. Truck sales have not fallen off as much as car sales, and have enjoyed a recent surge, although year-to-date sales figures are still below that of one year ago. Used car sales remain strong.
Housing sales have been mixed in the District. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, housing sales dropped 13.4 percent in September relative to a year ago, after rising in August, while median single-family home prices, "failed to keep pace with inflation." However, there are some recent indications of an improvement.
Tourist activity has generally been excellent in the District. Yellowstone National Park had its best tourism year ever. Bridge crossings onto the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have been up substantially this year, with crossings over the Mackinac bridge in October 4.7 percent above their year-ago level. Late fall traffic to view the autumn colors on Minnesota's North Shore is down slightly from a year ago, due to weather conditions in October.
Conditions were mixed in the District's manufacturing industries, with a number of firms reporting layoffs. In Minnesota, average weekly hours at 40.4 in October were essentially unchanged from a year ago, and down only slightly relative to 40.9 in September.
