Auto sales declined in most district states over the last month, but most dealers expect sales to improve slightly in the next few months. While financing is available for floorplanning, many potential buyers are finding it difficult to obtain loans. Dealers are still striving to trim their already low inventories.
Housing Activity and FinanceHousing starts across the district were up slightly from the previous month and significantly higher than a year ago. Builders expect moderate growth in housing starts through early 1992. While new home sales were generally flat last month, sales were up significantly from a year ago. Prices for new homes are slightly higher. Builders report no problems acquiring materials and generally expect none through early 1992.
Most savings and loan respondents report net deposit outflows last month. Deposits are expected to remain flat or to decrease in the period ahead, especially if rates on savings deposits continue to decline. Most mortgage demand is for refinancing. Rates are expected to continue to decline in the coming months.
District bankers reduced their prime lending rates last month, but most expect to leave these rates unchanged in the near future. About half of the respondents also lowered their consumer lending rates in the last month, and several anticipate further cuts of consumer rates in the near future. Respondents report no changes in their other loan terms.
A majority of the respondents experienced deposit inflows last month. The growth in deposits was primarily in demand deposits, NOW accounts, and savings deposits. Large certificates of deposit declined slightly, and MMDAs were unchanged.
District feedlot operators are feeding about the same number of cattle as a year ago. The backlog of heavy cattle that pushed down cattle prices last summer has gone to slaughter, enabling a partial recovery in cattle prices and cattle feeding profits.
Fall credit reviews for district farm borrowers showed little change in the number of problem loans since last year. Livestock profits were strong during the first half of the year and bolstered meager crop profits on diversified farms. Livestock prices fell in the second half of the year, however, and are expected to remain weak in 1992. Thus, farm bankers expect the number of problem farm loans to increase during the coming year, but the extent of the increase remains uncertain.
