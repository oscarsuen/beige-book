Sales expectations for the new year are mixed, and contacts universally cited the Middle East situation as a yet-to-be resolved uncertainty. Most contacts related a belief that the consumer has been postponing discretionary purchases. However, opinions were mixed about the degree to which consumer confidence will return, should a peaceful resolution to the Middle East conflict be reached. Several business analysts in the District stated that the perception of difficulty in the banking industry has also impacted consumer confidence. Retail contacts generally indicated that orders to manufacturers are running about even with those placed at this time last year. Increased financial difficulties and inventory building in several sectors, however, may constrain total order activity in the early part of the year.
