Developments in the Second District economy since the last report remain soft to mixed. Retail contacts reported disappointing sales results on balance despite some improvement just before and after Christmas. The underlying demand for new homes remains weak, and office vacancy rates in Manhattan rose somewhat further from already high levels. More positively, both the Buffalo and Rochester surveys of purchasing managers reported an increase in firms with improved business conditions in November, though more recent news from upstate New York suggests some slackening. Nearly all small and medium-size banks surveyed reduced their prime rate recently.
Items which sold well included some women's and children's apparel, men's shirts and costume jewelry as well as certain toys. Furniture and rugs remained weak, however, and sales of cold weather items such as outerwear and comforters were also slow. Due in large part to a pickup in sales during the last two weeks of December, inventories are generally at or slightly below targeted levels.
Office vacancy rates in both midtown and downtown Manhattan moved higher in recent weeks. In midtown, where an additional 2 million square feet of space is scheduled for completion in 1991, the higher rate resulted from slow leasing activity over the past few months. Although leasing activity has been more brisk in downtown Manhattan, blocks of excess space continue to he added to the market in the wake of consolidations and cutbacks in the financial services sector. Elsewhere in the District, the recent annual survey of Buffalo's downtown office space found the vacancy rate there had jumped to the highest level in more than five years, in part due to restructuring in the financial services sector.
The unemployment rate rose in New Jersey during the last quarter of 1990 but showed little change in New York State. In December, New Jersey' s rate stood at 5.9 percent, up from 5.2 percent in September while New York's December rate of 5. 5 percent was unchanged from September. Although New York's unemployment rate has remained stable, some observers are concerned because the number of employed persons has declined. Both New York City and State anticipate substantial layoffs more because of their budget gaps, and several corporations have announced impending cutbacks as further restructurings occur. One possible bright spot: the Navy is reportedly considering modifying an old Grumman jet fighter built on Long Island now that the Pentagon has canceled further work on the A-12 attack plane.
Most of the bankers surveyed indicated reduced willingness to make business and real estate-related loans. Respondents were evenly divided on the desirability of making consumer loans between "willing", "less willing", and "not willing". Most banks reported some strength in demand for either consumer or commercial real estate loans, but two noted weak demand in all sectors. Half expected loan demand to increase over the next three months, and half expected loan demand to weaken or stay uncharged. Factors contributing to reluctance to lend over the next few months included a national recession and a worsening of local unemployment and business failures.
