Most manufacturers believed that the business climate declined nationally and locally in late December and early January. They expected little improvement over the next six months, and only a third foresaw increased profits for their businesses in 1991.
Our telephone survey of home builders indicated that housing starts slowed more than usual in December. A majority blamed lower home sales for the slowdown. Builders indicated that many homeowners were remodeling and adding to their existing homes rather than building new ones. Few builders expected conditions to improve over the next three months.
Lenders indicated that the prime rate and other interest rates would have to drop at least one percentage point further to boost loan demand. They noted that much of December's borrower traffic consisted of loan inquiries and business loan refinancings rather than new loan applications.
Other District contacts suggested that consumers may be suffering from financial stress. These contacts cited increases in auto repossessions and home foreclosures. Also, according to surveys conducted by several District newspapers, many pawnshops indicated that their loan activity was increasing.
Serious revenue shortfalls were reported in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and the District of Columbia. In these jurisdictions, most major categories of tax receipts either were declining or growing only sluggish South Carolina noted a modest shortfall while West Virginia's revenues were still considered adequate. Both of these states, however, expected lower revenues in the months ahead. Respondents said lower-than-expected revenues were only part of the problem. They also cited overly ambitious spending plans, federal and judicial spending mandates and rising health insurance costs.
State budget analysts were not encouraged by the outlook. A Maryland official expected improvement soon; most others were hesitant to forecast a turnaround in the near-term future.
Our contacts suggested that the financial condition of District farmers remained strong, but some expressed concern that higher production costs may squeeze profit margins in the year ahead.
