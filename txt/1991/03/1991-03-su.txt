Economic activity remained soft in much of the nation but there were some indications that the decline may be slowing. The pattern of retail sales varied among districts with the majority reporting either sluggishness or results below planned levels. Retail inventories appear to be at satisfactory levels, except for some excess auto stocks. Manufacturing was sluggish in most of the country though several districts noted either a slight improvement or an easing of the downward trend. While construction activity continued weak, realtors and homebuilders reported an increase in buyer interest and, in some areas, purchases in recent weeks. The pickup was attributed to lower mortgage interest rates and more attractive home prices. Loan demand remained soft although mortgage refinancings have increased. Farm income prospects and mining output were mixed.
Retailers in most districts were hopeful that sales would improve with the cessation of hostilities in the Gulf but most did not anticipate strong gains until the economy rebounds and consumer confidence returns.
Lower oil prices and uncertainty about the future have caused drilling activity in Kansas City to subside though the rig count is still about 3 percent above a year ago. Energy sector activity remained strong in Dallas where oil companies expect demand for their services to increase as Kuwait rebuilds its oil fields. Oil production in the Atlanta district was stable. San Francisco and St. Louis report that the wood products industry has weakened in response to slow overall economic activity. Mining industry conditions have been fairly good in Minneapolis with 1990 iron ore production up 5 percent, but coal production in St. Louis has declined.
