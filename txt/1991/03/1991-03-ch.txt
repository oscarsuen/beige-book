Increasingly frequent downward revisions to announced auto production schedules have hurt inventory planning for dealers as well as parts suppliers. Car production increased during the month of January in both 1990 and 1991. However, production in early to mid-February 1991 turned downward again, in contrast to continued improvement over the same period last year. One industry analyst reported that current schedules still call for an increased production rate (seasonally adjusted) in the second quarter over the first quarter, in anticipation of a sales rebound. However, a large dealer expressed concern that the recent acceleration of fleet sales will provide an overhang of "nearly-new" used cars, dampening a production turnaround in the event sales rebound soon.
Price erosion contributed to poor steel industry profits in 1990 and may continue to hold down profits this year. One senior executive expressed optimism that the industry would benefit from price increases, which officially became effective in early 1991. However, part of the proposed increase has already been rolled back. Some industry analysts are projecting continued price erosion in 1991, citing increased competition to meet slowing domestic demand.
Several contacts noted that interest rate declines are not a key factor in today's commercial market, as institutional investors remain reluctant to provide capital for new projects. One large retailer stated that the firm's new store expansion program was being held back, not for strategic reasons or internal cash flow problems, but by the inability of shopping mall developers to obtain financing for new projects. A structural steel fabricator stated that architectural firms continue to cut back on employment, a sign that a turnaround in sales of construction materials is not in sight. Industrial properties remain the strongest in the commercial market, however, and have recently been viewed more favorably by investors, according to one commercial realtor.
