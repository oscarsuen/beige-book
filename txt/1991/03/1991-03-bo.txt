Economic activity in the First District shows signs of stabilizing, albeit at a low level. The retailers contacted report mixed sales results - about half experienced increases while others' sales declined, some by as much as double-digit percentages. According to the consensus, sales conditions will be fairly stable for the rest of 1991, forcing retailers to control costs in order to achieve adequate profitability. First District manufacturers generally describe current business conditions as weak, but half report a slight improvement in recent weeks. And most expect a modest recovery toward mid-year, according to press reports, residential real estate activity has picked up in response to lower interest rates and asking prices.
The consensus among our retail contacts is that sales conditions will be largely unchanged during the remainder of 1991. To remain sufficiently profitable, retailers will be forced to keep very tight controls on costs. Some are still continuing to reduce inventories. All are attempting to reduce labor costs through measures such as layoffs, attrition, reduction of hours, or wage freezes. (A couple note that increases in workers' compensation and unemployment insurance make it difficult to hold the line on labor costs.) Retailers' capital spending plans are modest.
At half of the manufacturers contacted, inventories are described as somewhat too high. One-third also expect to reduce employment in the next few months. Three-quarters of the firms have already brought employment below 1990 levels, with the declines ranging from slight to as much as 12 percent.
Most contacts report that materials prices are stable or declining. Three have succeeded in negotiating price reductions for selected inputs. Oil-related prices peaked in the fourth quarter. The only price increase mentioned was for specialty steel imported from Japan. A majority of respondents have raised their selling prices on selected products, with the greatest increase amounting to 6 percent. A minority are giving discounts.
Half the manufacturing firms expect capital expenditures to be unchanged from last year's level. A few plan increases of 10 to 20 percent; only one anticipates a decline. Most budgeted spending is for state-of-the-art equipment. Only two firms plan to expand capacity.
Most contacts expect prospects for the economy and for their firms to improve toward mid-year; however, they anticipate a relatively modest recovery. Positive developments cited include declining interest rates, the war's brevity and the need to rebuild Kuwait. Negative factors include "continuing financial fragility" and declines in military spending. Half expressed optimism concerning company sales or profits in 1991. Others express considerable uncertainty: however, they expect the outlook to clarify shortly, since the next four weeks should tell the tale concerning consumer confidence.
