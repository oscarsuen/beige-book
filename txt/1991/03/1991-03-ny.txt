Recent reports on District developments have been soft to mixed. Sales results at department stores have continued below targeted levels and District unemployment rates rose substantially in January to levels above the national average. More positively, homebuilders noted a recent upturn in buyer interest though the market remains soft, and office leasing activity stepped up. The majority of officers surveyed at small and medium-size banks reported that loan demand is generally weak.
Most retailers reported over-the-year sales gains in January ranging from 0.5 percent to 3.5 percent though one chain had a year-to-year decline. Big ticket items such as furniture, rugs and other home furnishings continued to be hard hit as they have for several months. Fall and winter apparel moved well at most stores after postholiday markdowns to make room for new spring merchandise. As a result, inventories were described as on target and, in one case, below planned levels. Retailers are generally cautious about the near-term outlook in view of the recession and consumer concern about the likelihood of further layoffs.
While District office leasing activity has recently stepped up, little or no improvement in office vacancy rates has resulted because of the continued marketing of new or no longer needed space. In fact, in mid-Manhattan, where new office towers are still rising, the vacancy rate rose by almost a percentage point between November and January and is now about three percentage points above January 1990. Vacancy rates on District retail space have also been increasing.
Both the Buffalo and Rochester surveys of purchasing managers reported an increase in the percentage of firms with improved business conditions in January following a large decline during December. Two-thirds of the respondents in Rochester anticipate stable business conditions over the next three months.
