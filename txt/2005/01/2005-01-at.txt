Sixth District business contacts reported that the pace of economic activity   increased during late November and December. Most retailers conveyed that holiday   sales were up modestly from year-ago levels, while auto sales rebounded somewhat.   Travel and tourism contacts noted healthy seasonal activity, with the strongest   results coming from Florida. Reports from manufacturers were mostly positive   and capacity utilization continued to increase. According to contacts, housing   markets in many parts of the District continued at high levels, while commercial   markets noted small improvements. The demand for labor continued to increase,   and reports noted a shortage of skilled workers in some industries. Contacts   reported that prices were largely in check, although increases for building   supplies and health insurance were exceptions.
District car dealers were encouraged by improved sales at year-end. This improvement   was largely attributed to extensive promotional programs. Sales of District-assembled   models were mixed, with transplanted foreign brands outperforming domestic brands.
Rising building supply and healthcare costs continued to be widely reported.   According to most reports, price increases for building materials were being   passed along to homebuyers. Several business contacts noted that a larger share   of the increase in health insurance costs was being passed along to employees   than a year ago. Fuel surcharges continued to be used by transportation firms.
