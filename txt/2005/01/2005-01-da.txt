Eleventh District economic activity continued to expand at a moderate pace   from mid-November to early January. While still mixed, manufacturing activity   strengthened some, particularly for chemicals and energy-related products. Service   sector activity was still strong, but there was some softening in demand for   temporary workers. Retail sales were mixed, while construction and real estate   activity picked up slightly. Energy activity continued to strengthen. Overall   lending and deposit activity continued to grow, and credit quality remains stable.   Agricultural conditions have been favorable.
Manufacturers continued to be concerned about input cost pressures. Several   industries said high energy prices have pushed selling prices up more than is   typical for this time of year. Declines in the value of the dollar have increased   the cost of some inputs, such as fabricated metals. Stiff competition is limiting   the ability to pass along cost increases. Rising prices for coke, coal, steel   and aluminum have led to slight increases in selling prices for some primary   metals. Higher input costs for paper products have pushed up selling prices   for toilet paper, tissues and paper towels, but stiff competition is putting   downward pressure on prices of corrugated boxes. China's demand for aluminum   has raised selling prices here, according to contacts. Rising cost pressures   are also a concern for contacts in the service sector. Some firms are able to   pass these cost increases onto their customers, but in other industries, contacts   say stiff competition limits their ability to raise selling prices.
Sales growth increased slightly for semiconductor manufacturers. Producers   noted continued gains in productivity and little overall job growth. Inventories   were reported to be in good shape. Demand for consumer communications equipment   slowed slightly at the end of the year after very strong growth in the first   three quarters of 2004. Producers noted that demand for products, such as cell   phones and personal communication devices, was strongest from markets outside   the United States, such as from Asia and Europe. Demand picked up slightly for   industrial communications equipment, such as switches and power sources, and   growth is now about the same as a year ago. These firms say demand from businesses   has improved recently but consumer activity has been unchanged over the past   year. Further layoffs are anticipated as a result of investments in productivity-enhancing   capital equipment.
Demand for primary and fabricated metals was unchanged from mid-November to   early January. Sales of primary metals continued to be slower than in the third   quarter--for some metals substantially slower. Contacts continued to cite lower   levels of consumer confidence and foreign trade competition as possible reasons   for slower activity, expressing concerns that China may become a net exporter   of steel. While overall employment has been unchanged, employees are working   shorter hours.
Chemical producers continued to report strong increases in activity. Domestic   and international demand has been strong for chlorine, caustic soda, ethylene   and olefin products. Contacts say that record exports were stimulated by gains   in the price of oil relative to natural gas, as well as a drop in the value   of the dollar. Demand for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) also remained strong, although   rising ethylene prices have squeezed margins. A major new PVC and chlor-alkali   complex was announced on the Gulf Coast, the first major expansion announcement   since the late 1990s. Gulf Coast refiners have finally returned to high levels   of operation following hurricane-related downtime.
Railroads reported strong demand and rising prices. The trucking industry   reported steady demand. Contacts say profits are being squeezed by high fuel   prices and medical insurance costs because intense competition limits their   ability to pass on cost increases to selling prices. Demand for air travel was   up over a year ago, and airline industry contacts said planes have been flying   fuller. Still, excess capacity is putting downward pressure on prices, keeping   airlines focused on cutting costs to improve their balance sheet positions.   Further layoffs are expected at some carriers.
