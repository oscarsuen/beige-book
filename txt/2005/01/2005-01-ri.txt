The Fifth District economy expanded at a quicker pace than in our last report,   led by firmer conditions in manufacturing and an increase in retail activity   in late December. District retailers generally reported that sales growth picked   up the pace after mid December and was particularly strong in the final week   of the month. Services providers reported moderate growth in both revenues and   employment, and major services sectors such as real estate and tourism remained   strong. Despite continued contraction in textiles, overall District manufacturing   output was little changed in December after having dipped in November. Bank   lending was also generally steady in the period since our last report. There   were fewer reports of spiraling raw materials prices in the manufacturing sector   and prices of manufactured goods rose only modestly. In agriculture, small grains   and livestock were in good condition in most areas of the District.
Commercial real estate agents reported that commercial leasing activity strengthened   over the final six weeks of 2004. "We ended the year on a very strong note and   are quite optimistic we can maintain that momentum well into 2005," noted a   contact in Charlotte, N.C. Office leasing was the driving force behind the recent   surge in activity as retail and industrial leasing were generally flat. An agent   in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area reported that the uptick in office   leasing was due primarily to the expansion of "large companies into large spaces."   There were scattered reports of increased office construction across the District,   while the pace of retail construction was reported to be moderating. Rents and   vacancy rates in the commercial sector were little changed.
