Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts indicated that economic activity     continued to expand from late November through early January. Eleven districts     characterized activity as expanding with Atlanta, New York, and Richmond noting     that the pace of activity had quickened since their last reports. The Cleveland     District was less upbeat, characterizing economic activity in that district     as mixed.
Consumer spending was generally higher since the last Beige Book and a number       of districts reported that retail sales during the holidays were above year-ago       levels. While the pace of spending was sluggish in a number of districts at       the beginning of the period, it picked up appreciably by late December. Adding       to the strength in household spending was an increase in tourism in several       districts. Most districts reported that manufacturing activity firmed and many       districts said that businesses planned to increase capital spending in 2005.       Although several reports noted some slowing in residential real estate and construction       activity, real estate markets remained generally strong. In the financial sector,       lending activity was mixed, as modestly higher commercial and industrial lending       was tempered by slower residential mortgage lending. Several districts noted       that agricultural conditions were favorable and that activity in the energy       sector remained strong. Labor markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage       pressures generally remained modest. Several districts reported higher prices       for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or       only slightly higher overall price levels.
Automobile sales were mixed. Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, and Kansas City   noted higher sales, but St. Louis and Dallas said new car sales slowed. Atlanta,   Philadelphia, and San Francisco noted that sales of foreign cars outperformed   domestic makes. Dealers in the Chicago, Dallas, and Philadelphia districts reported   that automobile dealers' inventories remained above desired levels.
Tourist activity strengthened in several districts. Boston said that increased   business travel, corporate spending, citywide conventions and increased international   travel boosted hotel occupancy rates. Occupancy rates were also up in the San   Francisco district, and the number of Japanese visitors to Hawaii has returned   to pre-September 11 levels. New York noted that tourist activity was higher   both upstate and in New York City where Broadway theaters set a box-office record   during the last week of the year. In addition, the Atlanta report indicated   that tourism was strong and that central Florida theme parks were filled to   capacity. Kansas City indicated that some ski resorts in the district reported   near-record levels of visitors. Richmond reported that because of unseasonably   mild weather, hotels were booked to capacity in coastal areas and that some   were turning tourists away during the week after Christmas.
But some manufacturing sectors weakened. Richmond reported that textiles and   apparel shipments continued to decline. Atlanta reported layoffs at a computer   circuit board plant, and Dallas noted slowing demand in consumer communications   equipment. Philadelphia indicated that demand softened for lumber and wood products,   paper products, and plastics, and Cleveland reported that sales at automobile   industry suppliers slowed at year-end. St. Louis said that firms in the fabricated   metal product, wood product, chemical, and apparel industries announced plant   closings and layoffs.
Looking ahead, manufacturers expected conditions to remain positive in coming   months. Most districts reported that manufacturers intend to increase their   capital spending in 2005. Firms in the Chicago district upped their planned   capital expenditures for next year; most have already begun to place orders   to accomplish those spending goals. Minneapolis indicated that expectations   of higher sales by businesses led to plans to increase capital spending in 2005.   Kansas City noted greater capital spending in 2005 to replace outdated equipment.   Richmond reported that manufacturers planned to increase capital spending despite   their skepticism about the sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery.
Commercial real estate conditions strengthened in most districts in December   and early January. Real estate agents in the Dallas, New York, Richmond, San   Francisco, and St. Louis districts reported that leasing activity increased--particularly   for office space. Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington, D.C., and   New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets. Contacts   in New York said the recent uptick in activity sent the Class A office vacancy   rate to a two-and-a-half-year low and may be a signal of increased hiring in   that area. In other districts, vacancies were mixed--rates dipped in San   Francisco, St. Louis, and most of the Kansas City District, but were generally   unchanged in other areas. Adding to the positive tone, commercial construction   activity was higher since the last Beige Book report--contacts in Atlanta,   Chicago, Minnesota, Richmond, and St. Louis reported new industrial or office   construction activity, while retail construction maintained a generally steady   pace.
Several districts reported that credit conditions were steady, though Dallas   added that competition between banks in that district could threaten credit   quality in the months ahead. In addition, Chicago and San Francisco reported   that banks' profit margins on loans were thin.
Agricultural prices were generally higher. The Chicago district reported that   net farm income jumped last year as a result of profitable livestock operations   and record corn and soybean harvests, much of which was forward-contracted at   unusually high prices. In addition, Minneapolis reported milk prices were higher.
Activity in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from   the Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts. Minneapolis   indicated increased mining activity, noting that the delivery of some mining   machinery required two-year waits. Kansas City reported that oil and gas drilling   rig counts remained well above year-ago levels, and noted constraints on drilling   due to labor and equipment shortages. Dallas added that the level of land drilling   was mostly unchanged but that offshore activity had picked up.
Manufacturing employment rose in Kansas City, New York, Richmond and St. Louis,   while factory owners in Philadelphia anticipated adding workers in coming months.   Planned factory hiring in Cleveland was mixed by product type--producers of   nondurable goods predicted little change in future hiring, but makers of durable   goods anticipated adding to their payrolls in the months ahead. Services sector   respondents in Dallas, Richmond, and St. Louis reported broad-based strengthening   in services sector employment, and contacts in New York and Philadelphia noted   a particularly strong pickup in securities industry hiring.
Information on employment staffing services firms was mostly positive, but   varied by district. Contacts in Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis   reported a moderate to brisk rise in demand, but Richmond noted generally flat   activity and Dallas reported a softening in demand for temporary workers. Chicago   also experienced a modest decline, but attributed it to a normal seasonal lull.
The reports from Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated that   wage increases generally continued to be modest. However, Cleveland noted that   in response to the strong pickup in shipping demand, trucking firms have been   attempting to expand their workforce by raising their wage rates and offering   nonpecuniary incentives. Kansas City also noted higher wages for skilled factory   workers in short supply, while Richmond noted that wage increases picked up   in the services sector.
In manufacturing, input prices rose modestly in most districts, but Boston   and Minneapolis reported that some input prices rose sharply. Manufacturers   of nondurable goods in the Cleveland district noted that prices for raw materials   continued to rise, while prices for durable goods inputs were steady. Prices   charged by manufacturers increased modestly in Kansas City, New York, and Richmond,   and remained in check in Atlanta and Chicago. Increases in the costs of building   materials were mixed by district. Modest to sharp price hikes were widely reported   in Atlanta, Kansas City, and Minneapolis, but material prices were flat in Cleveland   and New York, and eased somewhat in San Francisco.
Overall, price inflation remained relatively steady in recent weeks. Reports   from Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco   reported that price increases remained largely in check. Contacts in Dallas   noted that many firms were unable to pass rising costs along to the customer   due to stiff competition, and Chicago noted that competition in the retail sector   is expected to limit price increases.
