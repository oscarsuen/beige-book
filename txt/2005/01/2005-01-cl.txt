For the final six weeks of 2004, economic conditions were mixed across major   sectors of the Fourth District. Retailers' reports varied by retail segment,   while activity among the District's durable and nondurable goods facilities   was steady. Though residential and nonresidential construction continued to   slow somewhat, the slowdown was probably partially due to seasonal variation.   And while borrowing from banks in the District remained steady, demand for shipping   services was "surprisingly strong." In general, input cost increases   were modest and retail price pressures remained limited. Finally, staffing services   companies reported an increase in demand for workers from manufacturing firms.
Nondurable goods makers generally reported that production levels were flat   for the last six weeks of 2004. Some firms also reported a rebound in production   in January, but noted that this may be from seasonal fluctuations in demand.   Production levels were reported to be the same as or less than at this time   last year. Regarding expectations, several chemicals producers expect the economic   environment to improve in the near term; however, paper producers were less   sanguine in their assessment of the outlook. Most firms indicated that they   had little intention to hire in the coming months, or to add to their capital   stock.
Input costs continued to increase in recent weeks for nearly all nondurable   goods makers, and they are also higher on a year-over-year basis. By contrast,   durable goods producers generally reported that their input costs were flat   throughout the recent period, though their costs also remained above year-ago   levels. Finally, many durable goods producers reported rising wages and indicated   continued concerns about increasing health care costs.
Sales at District department stores were generally weak, while sales at specialty   apparel shops were more mixed. A few firms noted strong sales in early January,   though these firms indicated that they were sharply discounting some of their   merchandise. In particular, apparel retailers reported aggressive promotional   activity in the wake of sluggish sales. Discounters reported sales growth that   was consistent with their expectations. And grocers reported strong sales during   the holiday season, while restaurateurs reported weaker conditions. While personal   care products generally sold well, furniture and other home products sold poorly.
Sales at auto dealerships improved in December after a weak November. New   automobile sales strengthened throughout the month of December, as dealerships   employed discounts and incentives in an attempt to move merchandise. Nevertheless,   dealerships generally reported that their inventories of new cars remained above   acceptable levels. Used car sales were generally flat for the last six weeks   of 2004.
Accounting for the usual seasonal slowing in activity, nonresidential construction   was largely flat throughout the last six weeks of 2004, though customer inquiries   improved modestly during December. On a year-over-year basis, building activity   saw a slight increase. Regarding specific sectors, education-related construction   remained robust at year-end, and several contractors also indicated increasing   demand from firms in the manufacturing sector. Input prices for nonresidential   builders have been flat for several months. Few firms expected to add to their   workforces in the coming months, and most contacts think that activity in 2005   will be at least as strong as in 2004.
