The Ninth District economy showed continuing signs of growth from late November   through mid-January, especially in consumer spending, manufacturing, energy,   and mining. Agriculture was mixed, construction was steady, and tourism was   down. Employment grew slightly and wage increases were moderate. Price increases   appeared for a number of products including pork, fertilizer, and some manufacturing   and construction materials.
District mall managers noted a solid holiday sales season and between a 10   percent and 45 percent increase in gift card sales over a year ago. December   sales at a North Dakota mall were up about 7 percent in December from last year.   In Montana a mall manager reported a 6 percent gain in traffic for December   compared with a year ago. A manager at a Minneapolis area mall reported traffic   was strong, while merchandise returns were relatively soft between Christmas   and New Year's; total December sales were up slightly from a year ago.
Winter tourism activity was slow due to a lack of snowfall in several parts   of the district. A tourism official in the Black Hills area of South Dakota   reported that snowmobiling and cross-country skiing were down significantly   due to a lack of snow. Two downhill ski resorts in central Minnesota reported   November and December activity down slightly from a year ago. However, snowmobiling   activity during the holidays was up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and far   northern Wisconsin thanks to "lake effect" snow from Lake Superior. In addition,   over 125,000 fans attended games at the Junior World Hockey Championship held   in Grand Forks, N.D., and Thief River Falls, Minn., during late December and   early January.
Real estate sales were mixed. The market for industrial space improved dramatically   in 2004, according to a commercial real estate firm. A large user absorbed 212,000   square feet of office space in downtown Minneapolis, although downtown St. Paul   had a 25 percent vacancy rate, compared with 19.4 percent a year earlier. The   number of homes sold in Minneapolis-St. Paul in November was about 16 percent   higher than a year earlier, with particularly strong demand for condominiums.
In contrast, a Minnesota freezer manufacturer cut about 230 jobs in December,   and a software company recently announced plans to lay off 75 employees. A paper   mill in northern Minnesota intends to eliminate about 60 positions, and a mail-sorting   operation will shut down in central Minnesota, laying off 24 employees.
Wage increases were moderate. A Minnesota state economist predicted that increases   in real wages per job in the state will grow 2 percent in 2005.
Significant price increases were noted in pork, fertilizer, and several manufacturing   and construction materials. Pork prices in November were up 20 percent from   last year, while recent fertilizer prices were up 30 percent. Prices for steel,   plastics, and copper were significantly higher than a year ago. While recent   natural gas prices were above year-ago levels, prices decreased from the beginning   of November to late December.
