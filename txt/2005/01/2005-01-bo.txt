Business contacts in the First District continue to be fairly upbeat. Retailers   enjoyed higher sales in the year-end quarter than a year earlier, for the most   part, and tourism strengthened measurably. Manufacturers in many sectors report   growing fourth quarter revenues year-over-year. Residential real estate markets   remain strong. Insurers say demand is increasing at a slow to moderate pace.   Across all sectors, contacts are positive about prospects for continued expansion   in 2005.
Contacts report mostly steady vendor and selling prices, with the exception   of decreases in flat-panel television prices and increases for home appliances   and lumber-based products. Inventory levels are mixed, and employment levels   are said to be mostly steady, as seasonal hiring was minimal in November and   December. About half of the respondents note increased capital spending plans   in 2005, while the remainder report no changes or decreases.
According to contacts, travel and tourism in the Boston area continued to   improve in the fourth quarter, ending above year-ago levels. Increased business   travel, corporate spending, and city-wide conventions all contributed to the   pick-up. In addition, international travel reportedly increased 11 percent.   As a result of this growth in activity, hotel occupancy and rates are up, and   the revenue per available room increased by double digits. In December, client   and corporate holiday parties boosted revenues for restaurants and special event   businesses, exceeding last year's levels.
Most of the contacted retailers anticipate further improvements in 2005. Though   contacts expect only moderate gains, unlike earlier reports, they expressed   little concern about external factors, such as fuel prices, consumer confidence,   and the war in Iraq.
Demand for ground transportation equipment is surging, and one large company   notes that its trucking firm customers are having a hard time finding drivers.   Biopharmaceutical businesses say that industry revenues continue to grow at   a double-digit rate, but their own sales tend to be bumpy because they are driven   by patterns for individual drugs. On the other hand, manufacturers of some consumer   products report that demand has been muted.
A number of manufacturers mention that they are paying substantially more   for metals, petroleum-based chemicals, and energy than they did one year earlier.   In addition, some express heightened concern about the possibility of further   cost hikes for transportation and distribution, as well as foreign inputs. Respondents   tend to agree that cost increases from 2004 are likely to result in further   attempts to raise prices in 2005, but they have differing views on customer   receptivity and they are giving considerable thought to appropriate strategies.   For example, one manufacturer met unexpected resistance to its attempt to raise   selling prices on one category of products in late 2004 but is nonetheless considering   raising prices for another category in 2005. Another is intent on trying to   pass through cost increases "before the window closes." However, a   couple of other firms have decided to hold off on increasing prices until their   newer technology products gain a foothold in the marketplace. Prices for innovative   drugs are on the rise, reflecting producer market power.
Most manufacturers are making only minor adjustments in their U.S. headcounts.   Their continued drive for cost containment is putting downward pressure on employment,   but some need new employees to generate added sales. Pay increases for 2005   are expected to be in the range of 2.5 percent to 4 percent, but firms are more   likely to express concern about escalation in non-wage costs such as medical   insurance and workers' compensation insurance. Most respondents intend   to keep capital spending roughly unchanged from the amounts spent in 2004.
Despite the usual seasonal slowdown, residential real estate markets throughout   New England remain strong. Contacts report high levels of activity in most parts   of the region, diminished somewhat by lack of inventory. Shortages of lower-end   homes are especially noticeable. Indeed, houses in lower price ranges continue   to sell quickly, while those with higher prices stay on the market longer than   in the past. However, the longer time on the market is not substantial enough   to cause price declines and the overall level of inventory has not changed markedly,   according to most contacts.
In most areas, the number of sales in the last quarter of 2004 was similar   to the last quarter of 2003, while sale prices increased. In Massachusetts,   the number of sales in November was record-high, especially for condominiums,   with November sales 27 percent higher than a year earlier. At the same time,   the median sale price increased by double digits compared to November 2003.   Vermont recorded similar price gains, while contacts in other states cite more   modest price increases. Most contacts anticipate that the markets will remain   stable in the next few months as long as interest rates stay low.
