The Twelfth District economy continued to expand at a solid pace in late November   and December. Contacts reported little or no pickup in the pace of overall price   increases. The pace of cost increases for selected inputs eased, albeit from   high levels. Several contacts noted that some of the higher input costs were   passed on to consumers, though efficiency gains helped hold down overall production   costs. Wages and salary pressures remained modest but up slightly overall. Strong   export growth contributed to improving demand conditions in most sectors. Holiday   retail sales, on balance, were up compared with last year, with retailers stepping   up discounting in late December. Manufacturers, agricultural producers, and   transportation and other service providers generally reported strong demand.   Activity in District residential real estate markets remained robust, though   it moderated in some areas. District banks reported overall solid loan demand   and good credit quality.
Contacts noted little change in labor market conditions. Reports indicated   little or no difficulty filling positions, with the exception of certain high-skilled   jobs in selected industries. Wages and salary pressures remained modest but   up slightly overall; most District businesses reported that increases in benefits   costs continued to push up total compensation bills.
Sales of autos generally were solid during the survey period; foreign makes   reportedly sold considerably better than domestic brands, despite the dollar's   recent declines relative to other currencies. Final sale prices and profit margins   remained restrained as a result of intense competition, particularly among domestic   automakers.
District service providers reported a further strengthening in demand in recent   weeks. For example, demand for health-care and transportation services was solid,   and service providers operated at high utilization rates. District travel and   tourism activity was healthy in most areas, with increases in both domestic   and international traffic. In particular, the number of Japanese visitors to   Hawaii have returned to pre-September 11 levels, boosting activity there. Hotel   occupancy and average daily room rates continued to improve in many markets.
