Contacts in the Third District business community expect economic activity   in the region to continue on an upward trend through the winter, and some contacts   anticipate a slight quickening in the growth rate as the year progresses. Manufacturers   expect increases in shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers   expect modest growth in sales during the year, but auto dealers expect sales   to weaken. Bankers believe overall lending will continue to rise, although they   do not anticipate much growth in residential mortgage loan volume.

The region's manufacturers generally expect further gains in business   activity. Just over half of the firms surveyed in December expect their shipments   and orders to increase during the next six months, and around one in ten expect   decreases. On balance, area manufacturing firms are scheduling increases in   capital spending and planning to add employees. Although current conditions   vary among the region's major manufacturing sectors, the outlook for the   first half of the year is positive in almost all of them.
Third District manufacturers continued to report rising prices, with about   the same percentage of firms noting increases during December as in November.   During the next six months almost two-thirds of manufacturers expect increases   in input prices, and about one-half expect increases in the prices of their   own goods.
Auto dealers in the region reported roughly steady sales in December, on balance,   although results varied by dealership. In general, dealers selling domestic   makes saw some slowing in sales, and dealers selling imports saw increases.   Although manufacturers have maintained promotions on 2004 models and extended   them to 2005 models, many dealers' inventories remained above desired   levels. Dealers expect sales this year to be off at least a few percent from   last year.
Investment companies and stockbrokers in the region have been receiving strong   cash inflows, and most of the money has been directed toward equities. In response   to the greater volume of business, some securities firms are adding employees   and increasing their information technology capacity. Investment company executives   expect business to continue to expand this year, but they do not expect stronger   growth in 2005 than in 2004.
Employment agencies in the region reported moderate increases in demand for   workers in the past few months, and they expect the pace of hiring to be steady   through the winter. Companies in manufacturing, trade, and the financial sectors   have relatively stronger hiring plans than do employers in other sectors.
