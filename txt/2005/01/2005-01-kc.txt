The Tenth District economy expanded solidly in the period from late November   to early January. Holiday retail sales were favorable, factory activity strengthened,   and labor markets improved further. The energy and agriculture sectors also   remained strong. Housing activity slowed slightly but was still high by historical   standards, while commercial real estate markets generally remained weak. Wage   and retail price pressures were still modest, but some price pressures persisted   in manufacturing.
