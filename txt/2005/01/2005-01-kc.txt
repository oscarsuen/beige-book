The Tenth District economy expanded solidly in the period from late November   to early January. Holiday retail sales were favorable, factory activity strengthened,   and labor markets improved further. The energy and agriculture sectors also   remained strong. Housing activity slowed slightly but was still high by historical   standards, while commercial real estate markets generally remained weak. Wage   and retail price pressures were still modest, but some price pressures persisted   in manufacturing.
Agricultural conditions generally remained strong. The winter wheat   crop was reported to be in good condition across the district. In addition,   preliminary assessments of farm incomes for 2004 indicate they will be up slightly   from the record highs of 2003. Despite the higher incomes, few contacts expect   large increases in capital investment this year because many producers made   such investments last year. In addition, some producers in western parts of   the district are worried that a possible lack of spring moisture could worsen   already dry pasture conditions.
