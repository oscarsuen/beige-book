Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that business activity continued to expand from mid-April through May.  Most Districts--including New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minnesota, Kansas City, and San Francisco--characterized the pace of expansion as moderate, solid, or well-sustained.  However, Philadelphia noted that the pace of growth had eased in May while Boston and Cleveland observed some unevenness across sectors.
Retail activity was mixed.  Several Districts reported disappointing May retail sales results and cited unseasonable weather as the principal reason.  A few reports mentioned that high gasoline prices were having a negative impact on sales.  Almost all reports on other service industries were quite positive.  Residential real estate markets remained strong in most Districts, and several Districts reported improving commercial real estate conditions.  Most Districts reported that manufacturing activity continued to expand overall, although some reports described varying conditions across industries.
Labor markets improved in most Districts.  Overall price pressures were moderate, but several reports noted concern over high fuel, transportation, and building materials costs.
Automobile sales were reported as mixed by Atlanta, Kansas City, Chicago, and Dallas, sluggish in Cleveland, and down in the Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and St. Louis Districts.  Meanwhile vehicle inventories were above desired levels according to Chicago, Philadelphia, and Dallas.  Dealers in the Philadelphia area boosted leasing promotions to lower some excess inventories.  Atlanta and San Francisco noted that high gasoline prices were having a negative impact on sales of SUVs and light trucks.
Reports from the tourism and hospitality industry remained positive.  Tourism remained exceptionally strong in New York City.  Manhattan's hotel occupancy rate was more than 2 percentage points higher in April than a year ago and average room rates were up 17 percent.  Richmond said that hotel bookings at coastal hotels for the Memorial Day weekend were somewhat stronger than a year earlier and that rapidly rising demand for hotel rooms in the nation's capital drove room rates sharply higher in recent months.  Atlanta also noted that hotel and resort occupancies were at high levels.  St. Louis reported strong sales and employment gains in the hospitality services industry, and San Francisco reported that the travel and tourism sector continued to surge.  Spring tourism was flat because of cool weather according to Minneapolis, but tourism officials remained optimistic about the summer season.
Several Districts reported improvements in commercial real estate markets.  New York and Dallas saw signs of strengthening activity, with office vacancy rates retreating in several local markets.  Leasing activity has been fairly strong, according to Philadelphia, and Richmond noted that rents firmed and new construction has increased.  Atlanta saw solid improvements as firms moved forward with expansion plans; development also increased at a steady pace in Cleveland and Chicago and continued to improve in San Francisco.  Modest improvements were noted by Kansas City and Minneapolis.  However, St. Louis reported that commercial markets were mixed, and Boston noted that local markets continued to struggle.
Reports from most Districts indicated that price increases at the retail level remained modest overall.  San Francisco noted that price inflation for final goods and services edged up, largely because of the pass-through of earlier increases in energy costs.  Several Districts noted increases in transportation and healthcare costs.  Prices were up for construction-related materials, such as lumber, cement, brick, tile, and glass in many Districts.  Some Districts noted that manufacturers were unable to pass along rising costs of raw materials because of the presence of long-term contracts and competitive pressures from foreign producers.  However, Cleveland reported that firms have had some success in passing input cost increases along to their customers.
Activity in the energy industry has remained strong especially for oil field services.  Dallas reported strong drilling activity, long backlogs, and a dearth of skilled workers.  San Francisco and Minneapolis reported that producers were operating at or near full capacity.  Kansas City noted that drilling firms expected moderate expansion of drilling activity in the months ahead.
