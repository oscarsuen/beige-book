Most Sixth District business contacts reported that the pace of economic activity was solid in April and May.  Residential housing sales and construction remained strong, while conditions in commercial real estate markets continued to improve.  Reports from the tourism and hospitality industry remained upbeat, with hotel/resort occupancies at high levels.  However, retail and auto sales were more mixed than a year earlier.  Several manufacturing sector contacts reported strong demand, but many also noted that high energy prices were affecting profit margins.  Banking contacts reported that loan demand remained strong throughout the District and credit quality was good.  Labor markets tightened in some areas for construction workers, while temporary hiring remained robust.  Contacts continued to note price increases in building materials and energy, and several reports noted service-related price increases in transportation and healthcare.
District auto sales were also mixed in April and May.  Most contacts noted that demand for foreign brands remained strong, while domestic models lagged.  A domestic industry contact blamed the disappointing performance of U.S. brands on sluggish sales of large trucks and some SUV models, which may be linked to reports that fuel efficiency was becoming a more important factor for most buyers.
District transportation contacts generally continued to report good freight demand, although one contact noted a deceleration in activity after a strong first quarter.  Airborne shipments in March and April were weaker than last year in Miami and Atlanta airports.
Contacts reported that prices of construction materials continued to rise with a new round of increases for some building products expected in July.  Reports from across all business lines reported that profits were being squeezed by high energy costs, especially in the manufacturing and transportation sectors.  Healthcare and hotel prices were also reported to have risen recently.
