District labor markets tightened somewhat during the survey period, especially for skilled occupations such as nursing, construction trades, and various jobs in financial services.  Contacts from the financial sector reported a recent reemergence of incentive compensation, including signing bonuses to attract qualified workers.  Employer costs for health insurance benefits continued to rise, exerting a restraining influence on wage increases for some businesses but reportedly being passed on to final prices in others.  General labor market tightening and shortages for some skilled occupations led to increased upward pressure on wages and salaries.  However, wage pressures reportedly have subsided somewhat in the manufacturing sector, and reports from various industries suggested that the pace of wage growth more generally remained in the moderate range of 2 to 4 percent.
Service providers continued to see robust demand growth.  Demand for media and high-tech services strengthened, while demand growth remained vigorous for providers of food, transportation, and health-care services.  The District's travel and tourism sector continued to surge; the number of domestic and international visitors rose further at key destinations such as Hawaii, increasing hotel occupancy rates and average daily room rates from already high levels.
