Respondents reported some tightening in District labor markets in recent weeks, especially for high-skilled workers, though most indicated they were able to fill job openings.  The increased demand for skilled workers, along with continued increases in health benefit costs for all workers, led to a slight pickup in labor compensation.
District service providers continued to report strong growth in March and early April.  Demand was especially robust for health-care, transportation, and food services.  Activity in the District's travel and tourism sector remained vigorous, pushing up hotel occupancy and average daily room rates in most areas.  For instance, continued strong year-over-year growth in the number of domestic and international visitors to Hawaii fueled robust conditions in the tourism sector there.
