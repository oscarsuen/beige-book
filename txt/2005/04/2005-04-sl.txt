The District's service sector continues to expand in most areas.  Firms in the freight transportation, airport operations, traveler accommodation, warehousing, gambling, marketing, telecommunications, water supply, waste management, recreation, and educational services industries reported new facility openings, renovations, and expansions.  District retailers generally reported strong sales in February and March compared with the same months in 2004, although several contacts expressed concern about rising fuel prices.  Strong-selling products included discount and grocery items, clothing, furniture, and hardware.  District auto dealers reported that sales were flat or slightly up compared with last year.  Import, tractor, and used car dealers reported positive sales growth, while most contacts reported a continued decline in the demand for sport utility vehicles.
Commercial real estate markets in the District are still strengthening.

The overall commercial vacancy rate for the Jefferson-Bullitt County market in Kentucky was 19.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004, down from 19.5 percent in the third quarter.  The St. Louis and Memphis industrial markets are showing signs of improvement.  Contacts in Memphis, Little Rock, and Louisville reported that commercial construction is very active.  In northeast Mississippi, January and February square footage in commercial development increased 252 percent compared with the same months in 2004.
