District business conditions generally improved across a broad base of industries   in the six-week period through the middle of July, after a period of uneven   growth throughout the spring. Outside of a few categories, most manufacturers   reported that production remained steady or rose in recent weeks. And reports   from retailers suggested notable improvements in the sector, paced by strong   gains at automobile dealerships. As in recent reports, commercial builders continued   to see steady improvements in business conditions, while residential builders   reported a more mixed economic environment. At the District's banks, loan   demand was steady to slightly increasing. And demand for trucking and shipping   services continued to be strong, after slowing slightly through the early spring.
Growth in most materials prices moderated through the middle of July, though   prices of petroleum-based products and concrete increased more sharply since   May. Despite steady improvements in the economic environment in recent months,   hiring continued to be modest in most industries. Nevertheless, staffing-services   companies reported an increase in the number of job openings, especially for   workers with specific skills, such as accountancy and information technology.   Contacts at staffing-services firms also noted that these workers were in shorter   supply than in the recent past.
Activity at the District's steel facilities, however, has not been as   strong. Contacts cited weaker demand from firms in commercial construction and   in automobile and appliance production as part of the explanation for recent   declines. These developments have led to larger-than-desired inventories and,   along with an increase in imported steel, have pushed prices down for some steel   products on the order of 40% from fourth-quarter 2004 levels. Regarding another   important District industry, production at automobile assembly plants continued   to be above year-ago levels in June, despite some domestic auto producers'   recent production cuts.
Among nondurable good producers, production was generally characterized as   steady or rising, both relative to earlier in the year and to this time last   year. According to most contacts, the current pace of new orders suggests steady   gains in production through the rest of 2005. While most manufacturers reported that their input costs were flat or falling   for the six weeks through the middle of July, costs generally continued to be   above year-ago levels, and firms with petroleum-based products as important   inputs reported that their input costs rose in recent weeks. Several contacts   from durable goods firms reported that their companies were able to successfully   increase prices in June and early July. Hiring continued to be limited among   most manufacturers, and while durable goods producers generally did not anticipate   any significant changes to their capital spending through the end of 2005, several   nondurable goods contacts noted that they planned to upgrade equipment, in some   cases to improve the energy efficiency of their capital stock.
Automobile sales were strong across the District in June and through the early   part of July. Contacts reported that the recent employee-discount pricing policy   introduced by General Motors (GM) led to dramatic year-over-year sales gains.   Interestingly, respondents reported that the promotion not only benefited GM,   but also other automakers by drawing would-be buyers to dealerships. Other automakers   have since moved to mimic GM's employee-discount pricing policy, which   has been extended through the end of July.
Nonresidential builders continued to report more growth than their counterparts   in residential construction, with contractors typically seeing increases in   year-over-year sales. As with residential builders, materials costs were generally   seen as stable, though isolated increases were reported for concrete and petroleum   products. Builders noted that these cost increases were difficult to pass through   to prices, which have remained relatively stable. With respect to specific sectors,   contacts reported an increase in demand from firms in the manufacturing sector.   Finally, builders generally noted that their orders backlogs had increased,   which was typically taken as a positive sign for the future.
