The First District economy continues to expand, with the exception of New England-based   retailers. Contacted retailers say sales are flat or down compared with a year   ago. By contrast, most responding manufacturers are enjoying   year-over-year   revenue growth, as are advertising and consulting firms in the region. Both   retailers and manufacturers report cost increases that they are unable to pass   along fully to their customers. New England's residential real estate markets   are still going strong, although the pace of activity and rate of increase in   home prices in Massachusetts are moving toward normal from "hot," and region-wide   inventories of homes for sale are rising somewhat toward more normal levels.
Inventory levels remain flat or have decreased according to most respondents.   One exception is the apparel retailer who has increased inventories in order   to shift to more-salable merchandise. Several retail contacts note cost increases   for utilities, steel-based items, and paper; they remain hesitant to pass these   increases on to customers. Employment levels are mostly steady, with increases   occurring only in connection with the opening of new stores. Respondents also   report increased capital spending associated with these new store openings,   as well as for improvements in distribution and technology.
Most contacted retailers are less optimistic than in previous months, and   remain cautious in their outlook. Many hope that sales will at least remain   flat compared with a year ago. Respondents also express uncertainty and caution   about consumer demand, rising healthcare costs, and geopolitical instability.
Prices for some materials and services continue to increase. Respondents cite   cost pressures from freight and transport, energy, and petrochemicals and other   synthetic products in particular. In general, manufacturers cannot fully pass   along these higher costs to their customers. Some have managed to offset margin   pressures by introducing greater efficiencies in purchasing and production.
Companies are mostly keeping their domestic headcounts steady. A few are laying-off   employees or shortening the factory workweek. Hiring generally is restricted   to sales and marketing and high-end technical positions. Labor markets typically   are tight for these types of positions, but contacts do not complain of hiring   delays except for positions requiring government security clearance. Wage and   salary increases are mostly in the range of 3 to 3.5 percent. Most companies   are increasing their capital spending, but they describe their added investments   as modest or careful.
Respondents tend to characterize the revenue outlook in terms such as "satisfactory,"   "decent," or "on plan." Companies in information-related businesses stress that   they expect to grow more slowly than in the 1990s. Manufacturers say they intend   to remain focused on cost containment, especially given their limited ability   to pass on high oil prices and competition from producers in low-cost locations   such as China.
