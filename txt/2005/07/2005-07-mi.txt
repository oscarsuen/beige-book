Summer tourism picked up by early July. In South Dakota, tourism activity   started slowly in early June, but showed strength by early July, including strong   attendance at Mt. Rushmore on the Fourth of July, according to a tourism official.   Some resort owners and retailers in northwestern Wisconsin said they had the   best Fourth of July weekend yet.
