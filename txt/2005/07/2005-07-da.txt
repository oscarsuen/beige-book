Eleventh District economic activity strengthened from late May to early July,   driven by strong construction- and energy-related activity. Many contacts expressed   increased optimism about the economic outlook, noting surprise that activity   had strengthened more than they had expected. Manufacturing and service sector   activity was up. Retail sales increased. Contacts say real estate investment   is very strong. There has been a pickup in all types of construction and real   estate activity, leading to a very hot housing market and construction of speculative   office space in the Dallas area. The financial sector continued to report solid   loan growth and good credit quality. Hot, dry weather hurt agricultural conditions.
Most contacts expressed concerns about rising freight, fuel and utility costs.   Transportation firms said they are passing these costs on to customers as much   as possible, and even airlines have been able to raise fares. The ability of   manufacturers and retailers to push through price increases remained mixed,   however.
Strong demand pushed up prices for cement and most other construction-related   materials. Selling prices were lower for scrap steel, nickel, and aluminum.   Excess inventory led to price declines for a variety of basic chemical and plastics   products, but increased orders and unplanned outages were helping inventories   adjust and prices stabilize.
Respondents in high-tech manufacturing said sales and orders continued to   grow at healthy rates since the last survey. Industrial demand for semiconductors   has picked up in the past six weeks. Apparel producers say demand has been decreasing   due to import competition, which has resulted in another plant closure. Sales   of primary metals have cooled from very strong growth earlier this year, and   producers continued to report increased import competition. Inventories are   higher than desired for some metals but are being pared down.
Chemical producers continued to struggle through a patch of weak demand. Sales   to Asia have slowed. There was some improvement in orders in late June, which   contacts said was an early indication that demand was stabilizing. Refinery   capacity utilization averaged rates near 98 percent in the District, higher   than the U.S. average.
Demand for apartments rose over the past six weeks. Contacts noted an upturn   in market conditions with occupancies tightening in Dallas and Austin, and rents   rising modestly. Apartment construction continued to be at high levels in Dallas, Houston and   San Antonio, and developers remained optimistic that conditions will continue   to improve. Several high-end condo and town-home projects are slated to break   ground in Dallas, and contacts noted that most are at least 60 to 70 percent   pre-leased.
Office markets also continued to improve. Occupancy rates increased, although   they are still low in comparison with other parts of the country. Contacts say   rents are "firm" to "rising." There is limited office construction activity   in Houston and Austin, but speculative space is being developed in the Dallas   area. Industrial activity is also picking up, especially near the Port of Houston.   Hotel markets are "hot."
