The Fifth District economy expanded at a quicker pace in the weeks since our   last report as growth in the services sector edged up. District services businesses   reported moderately higher revenue growth in June and early July. Retail sales   gained momentum throughout the period, boosted by brisk automobile and light   truck sales in recent weeks. District manufacturing activity edged lower in   June but strengthened substantially in the first half of July. District real   estate agents continued to report robustness in housing markets and relatively   strong demand for office and retail space in the commercial sector. In the financial   sector, bank lending moved moderately higher as demand for residential mortgages   strengthened. When asked about prices, most of our business contacts responded   that price pressures remained generally mild. In agriculture, remnants of two   tropical storms brought substantial rainfall to the District in July, helping   to alleviate dry soil conditions and boost crop and pasture conditions.
Commercial real estate agents reported little change in Fifth District leasing   activity in June and early July. Demand for office and retail space remained   strong in most areas but the onset of summer vacations made closing deals a   little more difficult. "There is still a lot of business going on out   here; it just takes a little longer to get stuff done when summer rolls around,"   noted a contact in Columbia, S.C. Despite robust demand for lease space and   investment properties, agents said that price increases for both had begun to   moderate during the last six weeks, and most contacts said they expected only   modest increases in rents in the near future.
