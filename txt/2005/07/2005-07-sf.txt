The Twelfth District's solid economic expansion remained on track during the   survey period of early June through mid-July. Price inflation for final goods   and services moderated somewhat. Labor markets tightened further and an increasing   number of employers relied on incentive compensation to meet recruiting challenges.   District retailers and service providers reported sales gains, and growth in   manufacturing activity picked up following a slight lull during the previous   survey period. Demand rose further for District agricultural and resource-related   products. The pace of home sales and price appreciation remained rapid but slowed   slightly in some markets, while demand for commercial real estate continued   to improve. District banks reported strong loan demand and good credit quality.
Demand for labor increased, and District labor markets tightened further.   The most significant recruiting and retention challenges were reported for skilled   occupations in the financial, construction, information technology, and health-care   services sectors. Contacts in the agricultural, retail, services, and financial   sectors reported substantial reliance on temporary workers to meet demand. Although   wage growth generally remained in the modest range of 2 to 4 percent, contacts   in several areas reported rising use of incentive compensation, including signing   bonuses to attract qualified workers. Employer costs for health insurance benefits   remained on a relatively steep upward trajectory, causing total compensation   to rise more rapidly than wages and salaries. Looking ahead, about one-third   of respondents plan to increase their pace of hiring for permanent staff during   the second half of 2005 compared with the first half, and virtually none plan   to reduce their pace of hiring.
District service providers reported a substantial increase in demand on net.   Sales were robust for providers of food, transportation, and health-care services.   Contacts reported continued strong growth in tourist visits to key destination   states such as Hawaii, California, and Arizona, with further increases in hotel   occupancy rates and average daily room rates noted.
