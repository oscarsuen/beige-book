Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand at a moderate   pace during June and early July, though activity in Michigan lagged. Consumer   spending increased modestly during June, as did business spending and hiring.   Construction and real estate activity was quite brisk in much of the District.   The manufacturing sector continued to expand at a solid pace. Mortgage lending   kept pace with home sales, while commercial loan demand increased modestly.   Overall cost and price pressures remained moderate. The drought expanded and   has now affected all of the District' states, contributing to a rise in corn   and soybean prices.
