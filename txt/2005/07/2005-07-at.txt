Most Sixth District business contacts reported that the pace of economic activity   remained solid during June and early July. Disruptions from recent tropical   storms along the Gulf Coast are expected to have only a limited impact on overall   economic activity. Retail sales were up modestly from last year, and vehicle   sales benefited from new price discounts. Housing markets remained at robust   levels, although some slowing in activity was noted in several Florida markets.   Improvements continued in commercial real estate markets. Reports from manufacturers   were generally upbeat and most reports on tourism and business travel were quite   positive. Loan demand remained strong, especially in the housing segment, although   some lenders noted concern about the pace of condominium development in South   Florida. Contacts reported that labor markets improved, and shortages continued   in construction-related trades in several parts of the District. Price increases   were reported for industrial commodities, building products, energy-related   goods, and healthcare.
District vehicle sales improved in June. Several contacts cited a new round   of price discounts by domestic suppliers as boosting traffic and sales. Demand   for foreign brands remained strong.
Solid improvements continued to be noted in commercial real estate markets   across the District as expansion plans and new projects moved forward. Contacts   noted that office vacancy rates remain elevated on several markets but are generally   trending lower.
Most District transportation contacts reported good freight demand through   mid-year, although some noted a slower pace than earlier in the year. A shortage   of qualified drivers continues to be a concern for many trucking companies.
Prices for lumber and other building products as well as several industrial   commodities continued to drift higher, and most businesses have reportedly been   able to pass on some of these increases to their customers. Rising energy prices   and healthcare costs continued to be noted by most contacts.
