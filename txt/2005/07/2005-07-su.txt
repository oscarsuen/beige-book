Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity
continued to expand in June and early July. Richmond and Dallas reported that
the rate of economic growth increased, and Cleveland said economic growth was
stronger and more balanced than in the spring. New York was the only District
to report a slowing in the rate of economic growth. Among the other Districts,
Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco characterized the pace
of expansion as solid, while Chicago described the rate of economic growth as
moderate. Boston, Philadelphia, and St. Louis did not characterize the overall
pace of expansion, although Boston noted that locally-based retailers were not
sharing in the expansion.
Most Districts reported increases in retail sales, and vehicle sales in nearly
all Districts were boosted by a new round of price discounting. Demand for most
services, including tourism, continued to increase across the country, and most
Districts noted moderate to solid expansions in manufacturing activity. Commercial
real estate activity improved in most Districts. Residential real estate activity
remained strong overall but showed a few signs of cooling in some Districts.
Bankers reported solid or increasing loan demand.
Labor markets generally continued to improve, although hiring in several Districts
was mixed. Skilled worker shortages were reported in several Districts, but
nearly all Districts said wage pressures remained moderate. Overall price pressures
eased slightly or remained unchanged in most Districts, despite substantial
increases in energy costs.
Consumer Spending
Most Districts reported increases in retail sales, and reports on retailers'
expectations were generally positive. Dallas said sales growth had been stronger
than expected given high gasoline prices, and Atlanta noted that higher gasoline
prices did not appear to have cut into spending on other items; Cleveland and
Chicago said warmer weather may have boosted sales in their Districts. Minneapolis
and Kansas City reported solid year-over-year retail sales gains, and sales
also increased in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts. The
weakest report on retail sales came from the Boston District, where sales were
flat or down from a year ago and retailers were less optimistic than in previous
surveys. New York also reported a softening in sales in early July following
solid growth in June, while St. Louis said reports on retail sales were mixed
in June.
Nearly all Districts that reported on vehicle sales noted improvements, which
were generally attributed to a new round of price discounting by some automakers.
Cleveland reported dramatic gains, saying all types of dealerships benefited
from increased buyer traffic. San Francisco also said vehicle sales rose substantially
in response to the price cuts. Only St. Louis cited mixed reports on auto sales.
Sales of most types of vehicles were characterized as strong, although Philadelphia
and Kansas City reported some weakness in sales of large SUVs. Auto dealers
in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts were somewhat concerned about future
auto sales, but Kansas City said dealers expect strong sales to continue.
Services and Tourism
Demand for services continued to increase in June and early July. Boston reported
healthy growth in demand for advertising and management consulting, and Philadelphia
contacts noted increased activity in information services and business support
services. Richmond also reported increased demand for business-to-business services.
Demand for health care was reported to be flat in the Richmond District but
robust in the San Francisco District. Dallas and San Francisco noted an increase
in demand at transportation firms, while Cleveland and Chicago said that demand
for trucking was steady and that overall conditions for the industry remained
favorable. On the other hand, Atlanta reported some transportation firms have
seen activity fall slightly from the high levels experienced earlier in the
year.
Tourism continued to show strength throughout much of the country. New York
reported that hotel occupancy rates in Manhattan were near record levels and
that room rates were up substantially from a year earlier. In addition, Atlanta
said hotel occupancy rates in the Miami area were at record levels, and theme
park attendance was ahead of last year's pace. Chicago and Kansas City also
noted an increase in demand for hotel rooms since the previous survey. Tourism
activity over the Fourth of July was characterized as being particularly strong
in parts of the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts. San Francisco reported continued
strong growth in visits to key tourist destination states.
Manufacturing
Most Districts reported moderate to solid expansions in manufacturing activity,
and expectations for future factory activity were generally upbeat. New York
saw a rebound in manufacturing production in July, adding that manufacturers'
expectations had also risen. Chicago reported continued solid growth, and Atlanta
said that reports from District manufacturers were positive. Boston said sales
and orders remain on an upward trend. Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas
noted increases in activity as well. St. Louis and Kansas City reported moderate
expansions in factory activity, and San Francisco said demand for manufactured
goods rose slightly after slowing in the previous survey period. Cleveland said
durable goods production had been flat since the previous survey but nondurable
goods production was steady or rising. Richmond reported a softening in factory
activity in June but a solid increase in shipments and new orders in July. Despite
the overall expansion in manufacturing activity, as well as generally positive
reports on capital spending, factory hiring remained sluggish in most Districts
that reported on employment.
Activity in a wide variety of manufacturing industries was characterized as
strong. Boston and San Francisco reported strength in aircraft and high-tech
manufacturing, and Atlanta and Dallas said refineries were doing quite well.
Several Districts also noted strong activity for producers of construction materials--especially
cement--as well as for producers of industrial equipment and materials. While
most factory sectors were strong, some weakness was noted among producers of
metals and textiles.
Construction and Real Estate
Residential real estate activity remained robust overall but showed a few signs
of cooling in some Districts. Boston reported that residential real estate markets
were still strong. However, housing activity and home price appreciation in
Massachusetts moved from "hot" to "normal," and housing inventories in the District
as a whole became somewhat less tight. Housing activity was described as robust
in the New York District, but housing inflation slowed in New Jersey and the
condo market in Manhattan was less frenzied than in the spring. In the Richmond,
Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, housing activity remained strong but eased
in a few markets that had been especially hot--Washington, D.C., several Florida
markets, and parts of southern California. Dallas also described housing demand
as strong but noted that the supply of new homes was sufficient to keep housing
inflation from exceeding overall inflation. Housing activity was brisk in the
Chicago District and solid in the Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts, although
homebuilding edged down in the Kansas City District. The weakest report came
from the Cleveland District, where homebuilders have faced slightly softer conditions
since early spring and new home prices have been flat.
Commercial real estate activity improved in most Districts. Cleveland said
commercial builders were experiencing steady improvement and higher backlogs
of orders. In the Atlanta District, new construction projects moved forward,
and office vacancy rates trended downward but were still high. Contacts in the
Chicago District described commercial activity as busier than normal, although
activity was slower in Michigan. Commercial real estate activity was described
as strong in the Richmond District and as improving in the Minneapolis, Kansas
City, and San Francisco Districts. Dallas reported that speculative office construction
increased, apartment construction remained high, and hotel markets were hot.
Some of the increased real estate demand in the Dallas District was attributed
to outside investors attracted by the area's lower real estate prices.
Banking and Finance
In Districts reporting on banking conditions, loan demand increased or remained
solid. Overall lending increased in most Districts, with growth ranging from
slight in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts to solid in the Dallas District.
Atlanta and San Francisco both characterized loan demand as strong. In most
Districts, loan growth was attributed to increases in home mortgages, home equity
loans, or business loans. Credit quality was generally strong, although there
were some concerns about loans to auto suppliers and farmers in the Chicago
District and loans for Florida condominium developments in the Atlanta District.
Dallas indicated that competition for large commercial loans had intensified,
and Chicago said that competitive pressures had led to some easing of commercial
credit standards. Outside of the banking sector, cash inflows to investment
companies increased in the Philadelphia District, and venture capital rose for
the first time in five years in the Chicago District. New York and Richmond
also reported increased activity in the financial services sector as a whole.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Although conditions remained favorable in most agricultural Districts, dry weather
was a problem in some areas. Richmond reported that substantial rainfall brought
on by two tropical storms generally improved soil conditions in the District.
Atlanta reported only limited damage to crops from the storms and favorable
crop conditions overall, although citrus canker continues to be of some concern
in Florida. Kansas City and Minneapolis also said that crop conditions were
mostly favorable, and winter wheat yields were above year-ago levels in both
Districts. Some Kansas City contacts reported concern about higher energy prices
boosting irrigation costs. Drought conditions were reported in the Chicago,
St. Louis, and Dallas Districts, and Chicago noted these conditions had led
to an increase in corn and soybean prices. The lack of rain caused pasture conditions
to deteriorate substantially in the St. Louis and Dallas Districts. San Francisco
reported little or no impact on cattle prices from renewed fears about mad cow
disease, while Kansas City reported that the resumption of live cattle imports
from Canada was contributing to downward pressure on cattle prices.
Activity in the energy industry remained strong. Oil and gas activity increased
in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts and remained steady in the Minneapolis
and Kansas City Districts. Kansas City reported that drilling was constrained
due to a shortage of available rigs and regulatory factors, and some oil service
firms in the Dallas District were turning down available work due to limited
capacity. Dallas contacts also noted difficulty finding qualified engineers
and training crews. Atlanta reported a temporary shut-in of some oil and natural
gas supplies in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Dennis. Minneapolis respondents
said that mines are operating at full capacity, with exploration activity in
full swing across the District.
Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices
The demand for labor continued to increase in most Districts, although hiring
in several Districts was mixed. Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City,
Dallas, and San Francisco all noted an overall firming in labor markets. Boston
reported moderate increases in services employment and mostly steady employment
in retail and manufacturing. In the Richmond District, jobs increased moderately
at services firms but declined slightly at manufacturing firms. New York said
labor markets were a bit softer overall despite a pickup in hiring in financial
services. Several Districts reported increased demand for temporary workers,
while no Districts reported weaker demand for temps. Skilled workers were said
to be in shorter supply in several Districts, and truck drivers were reported
as scarce in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts.
Despite generally tighter labor markets, nearly all Districts said overall
wage pressures remained moderate. The only wage pressures cited by the Dallas
District were in the accounting and energy industries, and Chicago said the
only sizable wage gains were in some skilled professions experiencing labor
shortages. San Francisco also reported only modest overall wage growth but noted
an increasing use of incentive compensation by some employers to attract workers.
Rising health-care costs continued to be a concern for contacts in the Atlanta
and San Francisco Districts, but Chicago reported that one large health insurance
firm plans to implement the smallest premium increase in a decade.
Overall price pressures either eased slightly or remained unchanged in most
Districts, despite substantial increases in the costs of energy and some building
materials. Manufacturers in the New York District reported a marked deceleration
in input prices and expect substantially less upward price pressure in coming
months. Some moderation in input price increases was also noted in the Richmond,
Kansas City, and Cleveland Districts. Overall cost and price pressures were
described as mild in the Richmond District, moderate in the Chicago District,
and largely unchanged from the second quarter in the Philadelphia District.
Kansas City and Minneapolis noted some softening in the costs of steel. However,
many Districts reported substantial increases in the costs of energy, petroleum-based
products, and building materials such as concrete and plywood. Chicago, Cleveland,
and Dallas said that transportation firms were able to pass on much of their
increased fuel costs to customers. However, in a number of Districts, firms
outside the transportation sector were reported as having only limited success
passing on cost increases. Retail prices were reported as either flat or up
moderately from the previous survey.
