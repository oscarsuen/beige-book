Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity   continued to expand in June and early July. Richmond and Dallas reported that   the rate of economic growth increased, and Cleveland said economic growth was   stronger and more balanced than in the spring. New York was the only District   to report a slowing in the rate of economic growth. Among the other Districts,   Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco characterized the pace   of expansion as solid, while Chicago described the rate of economic growth as   moderate. Boston, Philadelphia, and St. Louis did not characterize the overall   pace of expansion, although Boston noted that locally-based retailers were not   sharing in the expansion.
Most Districts reported increases in retail sales, and vehicle sales in nearly   all Districts were boosted by a new round of price discounting. Demand for most   services, including tourism, continued to increase across the country, and most   Districts noted moderate to solid expansions in manufacturing activity. Commercial   real estate activity improved in most Districts. Residential real estate activity   remained strong overall but showed a few signs of cooling in some Districts.   Bankers reported solid or increasing loan demand.
Labor markets generally continued to improve, although hiring in several Districts   was mixed. Skilled worker shortages were reported in several Districts, but   nearly all Districts said wage pressures remained moderate. Overall price pressures   eased slightly or remained unchanged in most Districts, despite substantial   increases in energy costs.
Nearly all Districts that reported on vehicle sales noted improvements, which   were generally attributed to a new round of price discounting by some automakers.   Cleveland reported dramatic gains, saying all types of dealerships benefited   from increased buyer traffic. San Francisco also said vehicle sales rose substantially   in response to the price cuts. Only St. Louis cited mixed reports on auto sales.   Sales of most types of vehicles were characterized as strong, although Philadelphia   and Kansas City reported some weakness in sales of large SUVs. Auto dealers   in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts were somewhat concerned about future   auto sales, but Kansas City said dealers expect strong sales to continue.
Tourism continued to show strength throughout much of the country. New York   reported that hotel occupancy rates in Manhattan were near record levels and   that room rates were up substantially from a year earlier. In addition, Atlanta   said hotel occupancy rates in the Miami area were at record levels, and theme   park attendance was ahead of last year's pace. Chicago and Kansas City also   noted an increase in demand for hotel rooms since the previous survey. Tourism   activity over the Fourth of July was characterized as being particularly strong   in parts of the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts. San Francisco reported continued   strong growth in visits to key tourist destination states.
Activity in a wide variety of manufacturing industries was characterized as   strong. Boston and San Francisco reported strength in aircraft and high-tech   manufacturing, and Atlanta and Dallas said refineries were doing quite well.   Several Districts also noted strong activity for producers of construction materials--especially   cement--as well as for producers of industrial equipment and materials. While   most factory sectors were strong, some weakness was noted among producers of   metals and textiles.
Commercial real estate activity improved in most Districts. Cleveland said   commercial builders were experiencing steady improvement and higher backlogs   of orders. In the Atlanta District, new construction projects moved forward,   and office vacancy rates trended downward but were still high. Contacts in the   Chicago District described commercial activity as busier than normal, although   activity was slower in Michigan. Commercial real estate activity was described   as strong in the Richmond District and as improving in the Minneapolis, Kansas   City, and San Francisco Districts. Dallas reported that speculative office construction   increased, apartment construction remained high, and hotel markets were hot.   Some of the increased real estate demand in the Dallas District was attributed   to outside investors attracted by the area's lower real estate prices.
Activity in the energy industry remained strong. Oil and gas activity increased   in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts and remained steady in the Minneapolis   and Kansas City Districts. Kansas City reported that drilling was constrained   due to a shortage of available rigs and regulatory factors, and some oil service   firms in the Dallas District were turning down available work due to limited   capacity. Dallas contacts also noted difficulty finding qualified engineers   and training crews. Atlanta reported a temporary shut-in of some oil and natural   gas supplies in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Dennis. Minneapolis respondents   said that mines are operating at full capacity, with exploration activity in   full swing across the District.
Despite generally tighter labor markets, nearly all Districts said overall   wage pressures remained moderate. The only wage pressures cited by the Dallas   District were in the accounting and energy industries, and Chicago said the   only sizable wage gains were in some skilled professions experiencing labor   shortages. San Francisco also reported only modest overall wage growth but noted   an increasing use of incentive compensation by some employers to attract workers.   Rising health-care costs continued to be a concern for contacts in the Atlanta   and San Francisco Districts, but Chicago reported that one large health insurance   firm plans to implement the smallest premium increase in a decade.
Overall price pressures either eased slightly or remained unchanged in most   Districts, despite substantial increases in the costs of energy and some building   materials. Manufacturers in the New York District reported a marked deceleration   in input prices and expect substantially less upward price pressure in coming   months. Some moderation in input price increases was also noted in the Richmond,   Kansas City, and Cleveland Districts. Overall cost and price pressures were   described as mild in the Richmond District, moderate in the Chicago District,   and largely unchanged from the second quarter in the Philadelphia District.   Kansas City and Minneapolis noted some softening in the costs of steel. However,   many Districts reported substantial increases in the costs of energy, petroleum-based   products, and building materials such as concrete and plywood. Chicago, Cleveland,   and Dallas said that transportation firms were able to pass on much of their   increased fuel costs to customers. However, in a number of Districts, firms   outside the transportation sector were reported as having only limited success   passing on cost increases. Retail prices were reported as either flat or up   moderately from the previous survey.
