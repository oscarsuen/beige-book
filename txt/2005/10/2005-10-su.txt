Employment has been rising, and Federal Reserve Districts reported some tightening in labor markets.  Wage increases have been moderate, although a number of Districts noted increased upward pressure on wages and salaries in the service sectors and for some skilled occupations in several industries.  All Districts reported cost increases for energy, petroleum-based products, building materials, and shipping.  Several Districts indicated that input cost increases are being passed through to retail prices.
Auto sales fell in the Districts that received reports from auto dealers.  The drop came as manufacturers ended their discount programs.  Sales of light trucks and large sport utility vehicles were reported to have declined sharply.  However, within the generally slower sales environment, Atlanta and Dallas reported that sales of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars and hybrid vehicles were strong.
Reports on tourism and leisure travel were mixed.  New York, Chicago, and San Francisco reported ongoing gains in tourism business and high rates of hotel occupancy.  Richmond and Minneapolis reported slower tourism activity, although Minneapolis indicated an increase in business travel was boosting hotel occupancy.  Tourism in Kansas City was said to be largely unchanged after a period of strong expansion.  Tourism activity declined in Richmond, and fell in Atlanta as a result of hurricane damage in New Orleans and along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

Although levels of activity appeared to remain generally high, a number of Districts indicated that demand for housing was slowing in some regions.  Residential real estate activity continued to expand in Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas, and remained strong in San Francisco.  Richmond reported continued strength in housing construction, but indicated that demand was easing in some parts of the District.  Minneapolis reported that home sales had slowed in some areas but were strong in others.  Boston reported that homes were taking longer to sell, as did New York.  Cleveland reported little growth in residential construction.  Kansas City reported some easing in home sales and a growing inventory of houses for sale.  Chicago also reported higher inventories of unsold homes on the market.  Atlanta reported a strong increase in demand for housing in areas where evacuees from the coast were relocating, but indicated that demand for homes was moderating elsewhere in the District.
Atlanta reported significant problems resulting from dislocation of workers caused by the hurricanes.  Temporary help agencies have been active in recruiting workers for disaster relief and cleanup operations.  In locations outside the areas damaged by the hurricanes, employment centers have been established, and job fairs have been held to assist displaced workers find jobs.  However, employers in the Dallas District have looked to evacuees to bring needed skills to the District labor pool.
Most of the Districts reporting on wages said recent increases have been moderate, and Kansas City indicated that wage pressures have edged down.  However, Richmond noted that wages in the service sector have been increasing briskly, and San Francisco reported that wage pressures have risen noticeably for skilled workers in finance, construction, information technology, resource extraction, and health care.  Employers in the Philadelphia District said their benefit costs have been rising steeply.  San Francisco reported that employers there said their benefit costs have been rising faster than wages, but not as rapidly as in previous survey periods.
While a number of Districts noted increases in prices of final goods, others continued to report that those prices remain relatively stable.  Chicago cited price increases for pharmaceuticals and air travel.  In Richmond and Atlanta, retailers and other business firms reported passing their cost increases through into their selling prices, and in Philadelphia and Dallas, large numbers of business firms said they have raised, or plan to raise their prices.  However, San Francisco reported that prices of final goods have remained stable, and Boston and Chicago said that the ability of businesses in their Districts to raise prices downstream was limited.
