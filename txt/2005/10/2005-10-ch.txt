Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand at a moderate pace during August and September. Consumer spending continued to increase modestly, and business spending and hiring expanded at a gradual pace. Both residential and commercial construction and real estate activity strengthened. The manufacturing sector expanded again, though some firms in the District experienced minor supply chain disruptions related to Hurricane Katrina. Mortgage demand was flat to down, while commercial lending activity grew at a slower pace than earlier in the year. Cost and price pressures firmed on balance in August and September. Corn and soybean prices fell because yields were higher than expected and Hurricane Katrina disrupted the transportation of grain for export.
