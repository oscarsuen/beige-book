The District's business conditions continued to show gradual improvement, despite declines in some areas, for the six-week period through the end of September.  Manufacturing activity was stronger through the last several weeks for the District's durable goods producers.  And District retailers saw sales rebound somewhat in September.  In nonresidential construction, contractors again reported increases in activity, though sales seem to have peaked for many of the District's homebuilders.  Demand for trucking and shipping services remained strong in September.  And, on a year-over-year basis, loan demand at District banks was generally steady or slightly increasing.
Increases in firms' input costs intensified somewhat in September, especially for petroleum-based products, and partially as a consequence of the storms that struck the Gulf Coast.  However, outside of the construction sector, contacts saw storm-induced increases in costs as likely to be short-lived.  Hiring remained modest across most industries, with staffing services companies noting that employment conditions continued to improve throughout the District, but much more slowly than in the rest of the country.
Both durable and nondurable goods manufacturers mentioned increases in energy prices in recent weeks, only some of which were thought to be related to the hurricanes.  Thus far, the primary impact of the storms that struck the Gulf Coast on the District's manufacturers has largely been confined to changes in input costs.  In some cases, the temporary unavailability of certain inputs caused disruptions to firms' production facilities.  Nevertheless, most firms expect the impact of the recent hurricanes on their operations to be short-lived, and accordingly, few have changed their capital spending or hiring plans, which were already generally cautious.
Contacts were cautious in their assessments of the outlook, since most expected energy prices to remain high and to continue to undermine consumer confidence.  Accordingly, hiring plans among retailers remained modest.  Still, contacts generally thought that the storms in the Gulf had not yet noticeably affected their sales or operations.  With respect to prices, the District's department stores reported increases in mark-down activity, while other retailers reported that they were able to pass higher-priced merchandise along to consumers.
After strong sales in August, the District's automobile sales appeared to fall sharply in September when compared with a year ago, despite the continuation of several manufacturers' employee-discount pricing promotions.  Some dealerships speculated that consumers who had planned to purchase cars this year rushed to make their purchases earlier in the summer.
Commercial contractors in the District, unlike their counterparts involved in residential building, continued to see steady increases in activity in the six-week period through the end of September.  In addition, most firms indicated that their backlogs would keep them occupied through at least the end of 2005.  Commercial contractors also reported increases in input costs, citing many of the same increases in materials prices to which residential builders referred.  Regarding specific building segments, contacts cited industrial and institutional building as faring particularly well.  Despite recent improvements in business conditions, hiring among commercial builders continued to be limited.
