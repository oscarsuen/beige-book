The Twelfth District economy expanded further during the survey period of September through early October.  Increases in energy prices added to inflationary pressures in some industries, although overall price inflation remained modest.  District labor markets tightened further, with significant wage increases reported for selected high-skill occupational categories.  District retail sales weakened somewhat, but service providers saw continued strong demand.  Most manufacturers and producers of agricultural and resource-related products saw further growth in output and sales.  Activity in residential real estate markets remained robust but slowed slightly in some areas, and commercial real estate markets improved further.  District banks reported strong loan demand and good credit quality.
Respondents reported further tightening in District labor markets in recent weeks, especially for workers with specialized skills in the financial, construction, information technology, resource extraction, and health-care services sectors.  Wage pressures for these occupations were up noticeably, and one producer of natural gas in Idaho reported recent salary increases near 14 percent for selected occupations.  By contrast, salary increases remained much more modest outside of these sectors and occupations, in the range of 3 to 4 percent on an annual basis.  Employers' costs for employee benefits continued to rise more rapidly than wages, though less rapidly than in previous survey periods.
Activity in the services sector expanded significantly on net.  Demand grew further for providers of health-care, media, real estate, and transportation services, but contacts noted uneven demand for high-tech services.  District travel and tourist activity remained vigorous, notably in Hawaii, where domestic and international visits have been at record levels.  Hotel occupancies and room rates rose further in several markets, with demand stimulated in part by relocation of business conferences away from cities affected by the recent hurricanes.
