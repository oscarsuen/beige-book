The Eighth District's economy has expanded since our previous survey.  The services sector continued to grow.  Retail and auto sales increased in July and August over year-earlier levels.  Home sales continued to increase and commercial real estate markets gained strength.  Reports in manufacturing, however, were mixed.  Several contacts reported plans to expand operations and hire new workers, while some other contacts reported plans to close plants and lay off employees.  Commercial lending activity at a sample of District banks increased slightly in the past three months.
Car dealers reported that, on average, sales in July and August were up over year-earlier levels.  About 74 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported increases in sales, while another 17 percent reported no change.  Many contacts attributed increased sales to the price discounts on new cars; about 68 percent of the respondents reported declines in sales prices, while 26 percent reported no change.  About 45 percent of the car dealers noted that new car sales had increased relative to used car sales.  About 18 percent reported an increase in low-end vehicle sales relative to high-end vehicle sales; 14 percent reported the opposite; and about 68 percent reported no change.  Approximately 90 percent of the respondents reported no change in the acceptance rates of finance applications.  Just over one-half of the car dealers surveyed reported that their inventories were at desired levels, while 43 percent reported that their inventories were too low.  Nearly 48 percent of the car dealers surveyed expect increased sales over 2004 for the next two months.
The District's service sector continued to expand in most areas since our previous report.  Firms in the printing, health care, telecommunications, health benefits, and entertainment industries reported plans to open new facilities, expand operations, and hire new workers.  Several of these contacts cited proximity to the distribution infrastructure within the District as a major reason for their investment.  Some firms in the freight industry have added fuel surcharges to their delivery cost.  A large District retailer indicated that it has no plans to raise prices to pass on rising costs to consumers.
Commercial real estate markets in the District continue to gain strength.  The second-quarter industrial vacancy rate declined in Louisville, Memphis, and St. Louis.  Office vacancy rates in these cities decreased as well.  Contacts report that commercial construction is up in Paducah, Kentucky, while contacts in Evansville, Indiana, report only moderate commercial construction activity.  In southern Indiana, contacts report that government construction remains high.  Contacts indicate that industrial development is on the rise in both Memphis and northern Mississippi.
