In general, District business conditions continued to show steady improvement in the eight weeks ending August, despite modest declines in some sectors.  Most manufacturers continued to see increases in production through this period.  District retailers typically reported sales above year-ago levels with strong sales continuing for automobile dealerships.  However, outside of autos, there was some softening more recently in retailers' sales.  Commercial builders continued to report increases in activity, and while District homebuilders have seen demand weaken, sales remained strong by historical standards.  After slowing slightly in late July, demand for trucking and shipping services returned to its previously brisk pace.  And at the District's banks, loan demand from commercial and consumer clients generally remained steady to slightly increasing.
While most materials costs remained relatively stable in July and August, increases in the prices for petroleum-based products were widely cited by contacts.  As in recent reports, hiring remained modest in most industries.  However, staffing-services companies continued to report steady increases in the number of job openings available throughout the District.  Some staffing-services contacts also indicated that their job seekers have been finding employment more quickly.
Nondurable goods producers also reported production below last years' level, though there were some signs of improvement in recent weeks.  For the two-month period through the end of August, production improved relative to the late spring, with contacts sounding a somewhat more optimistic tone.
Most manufacturers reported slight increases in their total input costs in recent weeks, driven primarily by increases in the prices of petroleum-based products.  There were also slight increases in some metals prices.  Several contacts indicated that they could partially pass through these increases in costs to their consumers.  Hiring continued to be limited throughout the manufacturing sector.  Planned increased in capital spending were also limited, though several manufacturers that anticipated adding to their capital stock cited expectations of stronger demand through the remainder of 2005.
Automobile sales continued to be strong throughout the District in July and August, spurred by several automakers' employee-discount pricing promotions.  Some dealerships, however, worried that these promotions have simply shifted activity from future months to the present.  Dealers' inventories were typically characterized as at or below target levels.
Unlike their counterparts in residential building, nonresidential contractors continued to characterize business conditions as improving.  Nonresidential builders reported increases in activity relative to a year ago, and indicated that their backlogs were rising.  One contact noted that his firm's backlog was big enough to keep it occupied through the end of 2006.  Still, most contacts considered profit margins to be tight, due to both reasonably intense competition and increases in materials costs.  Prices for petroleum-based products, and especially for fuel, have been particularly difficult to estimate and include in bids.  Hiring among general contractors continued to be fairly limited, though demand for work from subcontractors increased in July and August, with several contacts citing rising subcontractor rates.  Regarding demand from specific sectors, contacts indicated that the number of institutional and educational projects available rose in recent weeks, while inquiries from manufacturing firms were also higher.
