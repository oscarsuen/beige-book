The Twelfth District economy expanded at a solid pace in late July and August.  Inflation was reportedly well contained, except for frequently noted price jumps in energy-intensive products and services.  Labor markets tightened a bit further, particularly for several high-skill occupational categories.  District retailers and service providers reported solid demand in recent weeks, and manufacturing activity continued to expand throughout the District.  Demand for District agricultural and resource-related products was strong.  Activity in residential real estate markets remained robust, and commercial real estate markets improved further.  District banks reported strong loan demand and high overall credit quality.
District labor markets tightened a bit further during the survey period, especially for high-skill occupations within the financial, construction, information technology, and health-care services sectors.  As a result, increases in compensation for these positions were prevalent.  By contrast, wage pressures outside of these sectors and for less skill-intensive occupations reportedly remained modest.  However, contacts continued to report that for most sectors and occupations, non-wage costs, such as benefits, grew faster than base salaries.
