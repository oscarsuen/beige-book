Reports from Sixth District business contacts suggested that the pace of economic activity in late July and August was quite strong, but had moderated relative to earlier in the summer.  District retail sales activity remained positive overall.  But several contacts suggested that the higher gasoline prices were a drag on sales growth.  Home construction and sales remained brisk, although the pace had slowed modestly in a few areas in Florida.  Nonresidential real estate markets continued to improve.  Reports from manufacturing and transportation contacts were mostly upbeat and reports from tourism and business travel contacts remained positive.  Employment levels continued to improve.  Temporary employment agencies and construction firms noted shortages of skilled workers.  Prices moderated for some non-energy commodities, and more contacts reported that they were able to pass on a portion of increases in raw material and freight costs to their customers.  Hurricane Katrina halted production in most industries along the central Gulf Coast and caused as-yet-unquantified damage.
District commercial real estate markets improved based on continued absorption of space and low levels of new construction.  Vacancy rates declined in most markets and rent concessions were less generous.  Some new office projects were announced for several District cities.
Despite high fuel prices, strong demand for freight services continued in late July and August.  Regional transportation services also continued to be boosted by growing international container traffic from District ports.
Higher energy prices continued to be noted by all contacts, whereas prices moderated somewhat for non-energy commodities such as building materials.  Several contacts also reported that they have been able to pass on some of the increases in raw material and freight costs to their customers.  For instance, trucking companies that had contracts with built-in fuel surcharges reported that they were able to pass along higher fuel costs.
