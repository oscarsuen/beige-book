Through the first two months of 2005, the economic environment in the District improved across an array of industries.  Reports from retailers signaled a slight strengthening in business conditions.  And production among the District's durable goods manufacturers generally rose as well, while nondurable goods makers saw steady production levels in early 2005.  Residential builders reported better sales in recent weeks, though sales levels were less than at this time last year, and nonresidential contractors continued to report modest improvements in their industry.  At District banks, borrowing by businesses continued to strengthen.  Finally, demand for shipping services remained robust.
While concerns about increases in some materials prices were reported, most input costs rose less rapidly or even fell throughout the last several weeks.  Plans to expand employment still seem isolated, though staffing services companies reported that the number of job openings increased in recent weeks, and is dramatically higher than at this time a year ago.  While contacts indicated that workers were not hard to find, some jobs requiring specific skills were reportedly becoming more difficult to fill.
Nondurable goods makers generally reported that production levels were steady for the first two months of 2005, and about the same as a year ago.  Refineries, in particular, reported strong sales.  Most nondurable goods producers did not anticipate a significant change in the economic environment in the months ahead.
For most manufacturers, input cost increases appeared to abate, especially   for food and energy items. While steel spot prices have fallen in recent weeks,   price increases for inputs into the steel production process--especially coking   coal and iron ore--were widely reported. Additionally, many steel contracts   are currently being renegotiated, and may result in increased effective steel   prices for many firms. Few nondurable goods producers planned any capital additions   or hiring; however, hiring plans were more widespread among durable goods manufacturers.   While most durable goods producers planned to keep their capital spending at   about the same levels, those producers that planned increases wanted to expand   capacity to accommodate an anticipated increase in demand.
Auto sales were mixed throughout the District, though trucks and SUVs continued to sell well.  Widespread incentives continued to cut the effective prices of new automobiles. Outside of autos, prices in recent weeks were stable, with a few exceptions.  Some apparel product prices were aggressively reduced according to contacts, while prices for products made with steel were said to be higher.
Nonresidential construction activity in the District increased modestly in recent weeks, relative to the end of last year.  Client inquiries also increased in early 2005.  Among the nonresidential construction categories, several contacts cited particular improvements in building related to the retail sector.  However, most nonresidential builders' backlogs remain light.  In general, contractors expect construction activity to improve throughout this year, albeit at a measured pace.  As with residential builders, increases in materials costs were cited by nonresidential builders, for items such as steel products and insulation.  While builders have attempted to pass these price increases on to their clients, they have had mixed success.
