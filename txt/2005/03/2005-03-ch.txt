A number of contacts reported that the auto industry was weighing down activity in other sectors of the regional economy.  Consumer spending was again generally subdued, and business spending continued to increase modestly.  Reports on construction and real estate were mixed by location and market segment.  Manufacturing output was relatively steady, but at high levels.  Household loan demand was reported to be flat, while business loan demand generally expanded modestly.  Overall cost and price pressures remained in check.
