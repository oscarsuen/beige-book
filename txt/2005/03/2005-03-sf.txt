The Twelfth District economy continued to expand at a solid pace from mid-January through February.  District contacts reported little change in overall price inflation, despite significant increases for selected producer prices.  Upward pressure on wages and salaries remained modest overall.  Employers have responded to rising costs for health insurance benefits largely by shifting some of the costs to workers but also by restraining wage growth in some cases.  Retail sales mostly were stable, although sales of new automobiles slowed; service providers reported robust demand.  District manufacturing activity expanded further and sales of agricultural products were strong.  Home demand remained robust, and demand for commercial real estate improved.  District banks reported solid loan demand and good credit quality.
Respondents reported little change in labor market conditions.  Employers in most sectors experienced little or no difficulty filling job openings.  The primary exceptions were selected high-skill jobs in the construction, health-care, and media sectors and jobs in many sectors of the Hawaiian economy, which has been expanding at an unusually rapid pace of late.  Wage and salary pressures remained modest in the District overall, with average annual increases mostly in the range of 3 to 4 percent.  Most employers faced upward pressure on total compensation due to large ongoing increases in health benefit costs.  While there were scattered reports of reduced hiring due to these cost increases, most businesses have responded in other ways:  about two-thirds of those surveyed indicated that they have already shifted or plan to shift at least some of the cost increases to employees, while about one-third reported that they have reduced wage and salary growth at their firms to offset rising health-care costs.  Several respondents noted slower growth in health-care costs recently, a trend they expect to continue this year.
Sales of services by District providers have been strong, and they expanded further during the survey period.  Demand for health-care and transportation services remained robust, and providers of high-tech services reported improved demand of late.  Activity was vibrant in the travel and tourism sector.  In Hawaii, domestic visitor arrivals continued at record highs.  More generally, hotel occupancy and average daily room rates reportedly were stable or improved further in the District's major tourist destinations, including Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area.
