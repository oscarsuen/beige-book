Economic conditions in the Eighth District have been mixed since our previous survey.  While the services sector continued to grow, reports in manufacturing did not present as clear a picture.  Retail and auto sales declined in October and mid-November relative to a year ago.  Residential and commercial real estate market conditions were mostly favorable.  Lending activity at a sample of District banks was largely unchanged in the three-month period ending in October.
Car dealers reported that, on average, sales for October through mid-November were down over year-earlier levels.  About 88 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported a decrease in sales.  Many contacts attributed decreased sales to high fuel costs; a few contacts also cited the end of pricing discounts as a reason.  About two thirds of the car dealers surveyed noted no change in used car sales relative to new car sales.  About half of contacts reported an increase in low-end vehicle sales relative to high-end vehicle sales, while another half reported no change.  About 38 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported that inventories were too high, 33 percent reported that their inventories were at desired levels, and 29 percent reported that inventories were too low.  About 38 percent of the car dealers surveyed expect decreased sales over 2004 for the next two months, 25 percent expect increased sales, while another 29 percent are cautiously optimistic.
The District's services sector continued to expand in most areas since our previous report.  Firms in the water transportation, warehousing, telecommunications, finance, and business support services industries announced plans to open new facilities in the District.  Firms in the freight transportation industry reported plans to expand facilities and hire additional workers.  Despite overall positive growth, contacts in the waste management and health care industries reported plans to lay off workers.

The third-quarter office vacancy rate fell in St. Louis and Memphis, and it rose in Louisville.  Commercial construction is strong throughout the District.
