Fourth District business conditions continued to show gradual improvement across a broad array of industries in the six weeks through the middle of November.  Production activity among durable goods producers saw gradual gains through the last several weeks, while nondurable goods producers reported production remained steady.  Most District retailers reported a generally positive economic environment since the beginning of October, despite concerns about consumer confidence.  While sales at automobile dealerships declined sharply in October, automobile assembly plants in the District actually saw activity increase slightly.  In nonresidential construction, contractors continued to report increases in activity.  However, District homebuilders saw sales continue to trend down.  Finally, demand for trucking and shipping services remained robust throughout the District.
Firms continued to report increases in their input costs through the middle of November, especially for petroleum-based products, but these increases were generally more modest than in the recent past.  Aside from petroleum products, contacts also cited increases in the prices for steel, drywall, lumber, concrete, and natural gas.  Companies continued to add to their payrolls sparingly, although some staffing services contacts reported that their placements improved in October and early November, at a time when there is typically a seasonal slowing in demand.
Most manufacturers saw slight increases in their input costs from October through the middle of November.  Costs also continued to be notably higher for most firms relative to this time last year.  In general, increases in costs were tied to petroleum and petroleum-based products, like plastics and resins, though contacts noted that natural gas and steel prices had also risen.  Hiring continued to be modest among manufacturers, while durable goods producers reported plans to increase their capital spending, as a response to stronger demand.
Outside of autos, many contacts reported that their product prices had, on average, risen in recent months, while few contacts reported any major changes to their input costs, aside from some increases in transportation costs.  Hiring has been modest for most retailers, and some noted that they will hire fewer workers this holiday selling season than in the past.
Most nonresidential builders noted that their sales had risen in recent months, and were also higher than at this time last year.  Moreover, builders' backlogs were regarded as relatively strong.  Increases in materials costs were also widely reported among nonresidential builders, though these increases were much more modest than in the previous report.  Contacts reported that their attempts to recover these increases in costs met with differing degrees of success, though several contacts mentioned that their clients seemed to expect higher prices now.
