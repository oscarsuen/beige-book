Reports from Sixth District business contacts suggested that the pace of economic activity improved in October and early November.  Demolition, cleanup and repair work along the Gulf Coast was continuing, although full-scale rebuilding is not expected to be underway until early next year.  Retailers' reports were positive and their outlook for holiday sales improved relative to immediately after the Gulf Coast hurricanes.  Housing activity remained at high levels, although reports suggest that demand eased in a few areas.  District manufacturers noted improved conditions as several facilities came back on line and post-hurricane demand boosted production in several industries.  The demand for freight services remained strong around the region.  Contacts in the tourism industry were upbeat despite disruptions in South Florida caused by Hurricane Wilma.  Labor shortages were noted in storm-damaged areas, especially in the construction industry.  Most contacts continued to note higher energy and input costs, whereas the ability to pass these higher costs on to customers was mixed.
District auto sales in October were weaker than last year.  Most contacts attributed this to disruptions caused by Hurricane Wilma and the absence of new incentive programs.  Contacts also noted that demand continued to shift away from full-size SUVs and trucks to smaller and more fuel efficient models.  Automobile dealers in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita reported a strong upsurge in replacement sales and strong demand from commercial customers.
Reports on price increases and price pass through were mixed.  Transportation firms continued to add a fuel surcharge to their normal fees, and some construction companies are reportedly including clauses in their contracts to cover future material and fuel price increases.  Higher input and output prices were also noted in the petrochemical sector.  However, other contacts reported difficulty passing on cost increases because of competitive pressures.  Some have lowered expectations for future earnings because of higher costs for commodities, packaging, transportation, and energy that cannot be fully passed on to consumers.
Most of Louisiana's and Mississippi's petroleum refining capacity is back on-line, but contacts reported that natural gas processing remains a concern as repair of processing facilities is taking longer than expected, with a number of locations still off-line.
Hurricane Wilma caused an estimated $1.5 billion loss in Florida crop production, with nurseries, sugarcane, and citrus reporting the largest losses.  Elsewhere, dry weather contributed to healthy fieldwork rates.
