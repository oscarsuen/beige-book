The Twelfth District economy expanded at a solid pace during the survey period of mid-October through mid-November.  Elevated energy prices kept input costs high in some industries, but overall price inflation was held down by limited pass-through of these input prices to final prices.  Contacts noted little labor market slack in most areas, although significant wage increases were reported only for scattered groups of workers with specialized skills.  Sales of most retail items except automobiles were solid, and service providers reported strong demand.  Manufacturers and agricultural producers saw further growth in output and sales.  Activity in residential real estate markets cooled in some areas but remained at high levels overall, while demand for commercial real estate improved further.  District banks reported solid loan demand and good credit quality.
Contacts noted only limited labor market slack, with especially tight conditions evident for workers with specialized skills in the financial, construction, and health-care services sectors, some of whom saw considerable salary increases.  Outside of these worker groups, salary pressures generally remained modest, although a few contacts noted significant increases in overall labor costs.  Employers' costs for employee benefits reportedly rose at nearly a double-digit pace, substantially outstripping salary growth.
Demand for services was strong overall.  Service providers in the food and beverage, health-care, media, and transportation sectors reported substantial sales growth.  Activity in the travel and tourism sector remained robust.  Hawaii is on track to set a record for tourist visits this year, and contacts reported rising hotel occupancies and room rates there and in California.
