Wage pressures were moderate overall, with considerable variation. Fewer than half of staffing firms polled by the Minneapolis Fed said wages grew by more than 3 percent over the past 12 months, though more than 60 percent said they expected wage increases above 3 percent over the coming year. Close to 70 percent of firms in the aforementioned greater Minnesota poll said wages grew by less than 3 percent over the past year, with future wage expectations only slightly higher. However, a contact in Michigan's U.P. said housekeeping positions have recently seen wage increases of 10 percent or more, while a call center and manufacturer there increased wages by more than 5 percent. A construction contact said workers were getting recruited regularly, and a 3 percent raise "isn't good enough" to retain good employees. In contrast, a manufacturer of hardwood products with plants in Wisconsin that has been "significantly affected" by tariffs cut wages by 10 percent.
Commercial real estate was modestly higher. Vacancy rates in most subsectors in Minneapolis-St. Paul remained stable. Despite persistent new construction of multifamily units, continued low vacancy rates have led to rising rentsâ€”roughly 5 percent in the past 12 months, according to one source. Residential real estate fell slightly overall, with mixed sales activity across the District in November compared with a year earlier. Northern and western counties of Wisconsin located in the District saw higher sales, and Great Falls, Mont., saw particularly robust activity. However, sales in Minnesota were largely flat, while small declines were seen in Bozeman and Missoula, Mont., and Sioux Falls, S.D. Fargo and Grand Forks, N.D., experienced larger declines.
