Wages rose further across the District as companies tried to attract and retain qualified workers. Wages picked up across skill levels as labor markets remained highly competitive. In the Mountain West, a contact in the banking sector noted paying more than double the prevailing market rate for some positions. Entry-level wages also rose in many sectors including finance, tourism, and retail despite reports of decreasing labor quality. A few employers in Seattle and Southern California highlighted regulatory increases in minimum wages as an additional source of upward wage pressures. A business services provider in the Pacific Northwest and a hotelier in California each raised concerns about wage compression in the face of increasing entry-level and minimum wages. Employers across the District also observed that benefit packages expanded, further increasing total labor costs.
Activity in the consumer and business services sectors was modestly stronger. Demand for health services and insurance remained robust across the District, the latter especially boosted by more comprehensive benefit packages in the face of tight competition for workers. Restaurants and food service providers reported solid sales over the holidays, though a major quick service restaurant in the Pacific Northwest witnessed a slight dip in sales over the reporting period. Holiday activity in the tourism sector was mixed, with bookings for leisure cruises and airline travel rising noticeably, while year-end occupancy rates at Southern California hotels were down from earlier in the year.
Activity in commercial real estate markets softened somewhat. Demand for retail and office space in California weakened, with some reports noting little new construction. Commercial permitting also decreased in the Central Valley of California over the reporting period, though it remained stable in the Pacific Northwest. In contrast, demand for industrial spaces, like warehouses and distribution centers, remained elevated. Contacts noted that very low vacancy rates and increased leasing costs have spurred construction of new industrial spaces across the District. In the Pacific Northwest, public infrastructure construction also increased.
