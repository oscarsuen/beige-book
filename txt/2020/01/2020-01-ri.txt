Fifth District trucking rates continued to soften, and while shipments were lower than last year, they were slightly above the previous few months. Retail shipments were fairly strong for the holiday season. Some trucking companies picked up both business and labor from a major company closure as well as from continued closures of smaller companies. Low fuel prices helped margins amid softening rates, but one executive is struggling with increasing costs of liability insurance. Trucking firms expressed concerns about political uncertainty going into an election year, but continued to make long-term investments and were optimistic that business would remain solid.
Retailers in the Fifth District reported moderate sales in recent weeks. Stores had solid customer traffic for the holidays, and many retailers reported that holiday sales were level with or up from last year. Auto dealers had increasing sales, amid high manufacturer incentives, and noted a shift towards smaller down payments and longer term financing. Some dealers said that rising costs were leading them to raise prices, and there were mild concerns about tariffs and online competition. However, other dealers have continued to invest and expand, as they expect to see strong growth in 2020.
Commercial real estate leasing remained strong since our last report. Brokers reported strong demand for industrial and retail space but slightly lower demand for office leasing.

Office vacancy rates were stable, although some brokers expect them to increase in the coming months. Commercial real estate sales and sale prices showed modest growth, boosted by low interest rates, and construction remained strong across most types of properties, even though construction costs are high.
