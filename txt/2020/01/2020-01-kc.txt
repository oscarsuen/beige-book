A majority of survey contacts cited labor shortages as the single most important problem currently facing their business. Specifically, contacts noted shortages for hourly retail and food services positions, mechanics, truck drivers, skilled construction, software developers, pharmacists and nurse practitioners. Wages continued to rise modestly since the previous survey period, and moderate gains were expected in the months ahead.
Outside of manufacturing, firms in the transportation sector experienced modestly lower sales, while sales increased modestly for both the wholesale trade and professional and high-tech services sectors. Sales for all three sectors remained above year-ago levels. Contacts in the transportation sector anticipated sales to edge down in the coming months, whereas sales were expected to continue to rise in the wholesale trade and professional and high-tech services sectors.
