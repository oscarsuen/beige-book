The firms continued to report tight labor market conditions. Lack of available labor has constrained production and expansion plans, according to various manufacturing and service-sector firms. Staffing firms reported continued demand for new job placements from clients but an insufficient supply of qualified labor to fill the orders. Turnover rates are rising, and nonstandard shifts are most difficult to fill. One staffing contact noted that some clients simply canceled orders from the fall that had gone unfilled. Another noted that a new hire took another job during the firm's onboarding orientation.
On balance, wage growth continued at a moderate pace, and many contacts noted a resumption of rising wage pressure. One staffing firm reported that its wage rates were up 4 to 5 percent year over year. Another staffing firm noted that $15 an hour was now the minimum required to attract workers for a manufacturing/warehousing job but that these workers were being drawn from other employers. On average, the share of nonmanufacturing contacts who reported increases in wage and benefit costs remained near 44 percent; just 3 percent reported decreases.
Looking ahead six months, the anticipation of higher prices has broadened among manufacturers. About half of the firms expected higher prices; almost none expected prices to fall. This was true for prices firms expected to pay as well as for prices firms expected to receive for their own goods.
Comments remain mixed. Primary metals firms continued to note that some customers are beginning to source parts domestically again. However, downstream fabricators continued to note uncertainty, delayed or canceled expansions, and fewer orders from their customers. One contact did note that settling the new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico provided greater certainty and should increase some domestic production.
Manufacturers' expectations of activity over the next six months eased somewhat. Expectations of shipments and of new orders edged lower but remained above long-term nonrecession averages. Planned capital spending also fell, yet expectations of future employment increases rose.
Most auto dealers reported that sales were flat to up slightly, although the pace appeared to wane near year-end. Dealers noted that sales were stronger in more profitable segments, such as SUVs, than in sedans. The profitable used car market also remained strong. Early estimates of total 2019 sales growth were positive for most New Jersey and Pennsylvania dealers, and they expressed optimism for another good sales year in 2020.
During the current period (reported without seasonal adjustments), volumes appeared to grow robustly for home mortgages and commercial real estate, and modestly for other consumer loans (not elsewhere classified). Home equity lines and commercial and industrial loan volumes declined, while auto lending appeared flat.
Banking contacts continued to express few concerns over credit quality; however, one contact noted that mortgage delinquencies had ticked up but were still at good levels. Of greater concern was an observation that as interest rates fell, many homeowners took additional cash with their refinanced mortgages – raising the question for banking contacts of whether the cash was for additional investment or was taken out of necessity to pay down other debt. Most banking contacts remained optimistic about continued growth through 2020.
Existing home sales continued to decline moderately on a year-over-year basis across most local markets, with exceptions of slight growth at the Jersey shore. Inventory constraints persisted. An area broker confirmed that potential listings of existing homes may be lost to investors converting houses to rentals and to developers razing houses, then rebuilding new units, to a greater degree than normal, especially in Philadelphia.
On balance, commercial real estate construction appeared to ease slightly, while leasing activity held steady – both at relatively high levels. Contacts reported continued strength in the industrial market, with ongoing demand for new construction; however, a few contacts noted that some warehouses are not being used to capacity. Most contacts remain optimistic about office space leasing and construction, but one noted that Philadelphia's construction activity has fallen slightly and may remain a bit below prior-year levels.
