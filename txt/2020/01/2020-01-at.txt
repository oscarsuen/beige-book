On average, firms maintained merit increases of 2.5-4 percent, though wage pressure continued to build for lower-skilled positions. Some contacts indicated they expect wages and health insurance costs to accelerate in 2020.
On balance, District travel and tourism contacts noted a strong holiday travel season with year-over-year growth in leisure travel. The outlook for 2020 remained positive with healthy advance bookings through the first quarter of the year.
Commercial real estate (CRE) contacts reported leasing and sales activity remained steady during the reporting period, although some contacts mentioned growing uncertainty as a concern. Overall, most sectors experienced positive dynamics as rents continued to grow and vacancies trended downward at a modest pace. However, some CRE contacts did report that continued growth in construction costs was impacting the start of a modest number of new projects. Contacts continued to report that capital for CRE projects was readily available via banks and non-bank entities, with non-bank entities remaining aggressive in financing both construction and stabilized CRE projects. Modestly growing amounts of leverage, loosening of underwriting standards, and an increase in covenant-lite structures were noted.
