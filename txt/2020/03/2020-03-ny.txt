New York City’s residential rental market has been mixed: Manhattan’s market has continued to strengthen—especially at the higher end, as apartment-seekers have shied away from the sales market. In the outer boroughs, however, excess inventories of new rental developments have held back rents.

An industry contact noted concern among real estate professionals about recent efforts to ban charging fees to new renters.
