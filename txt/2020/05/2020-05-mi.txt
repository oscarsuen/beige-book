Wage pressures fell due to the steep decline in overall activity. A Districtwide survey of firms found that more than one-quarter have implemented some level of wage cuts, and a similar share of firms expected additional wages cuts over the coming three months. Firms in Minnesota had a higher incidence of wage cuts, while firms in the Dakotas saw a notably lower share. A Minnesota manufacturer cut wages by almost 4 percent for most workers, with senior management and managers taking pay cuts of 10 percent to 20 percent.
Commercial real estate activity fell since the last report. Slower economic activity was negatively affecting all real estate categories, but particularly retail and office space. Vacancy rates were expected to increase across the board as leasing activity slowed. Among industry subsectors, industrial space was reported to be faring the best, in part because of increased e-commerce demand for warehouse space, both currently and going forward. Rent collections were "top of mind," among contacts. A multifamily property manager reported that rent delinquencies were elevated in May, but by less than expected, and reflected an improvement over April levels. Residential real estate was mixed. Home sales in Minnesota rose 1 percent in April over a year earlier. Sales elsewhere over this period were higher in northern Wisconsin, Fargo, Sioux Falls, and Great Falls, Mont., but lower in western Wisconsin, Grand Forks, N.D., and Missoula and Bozeman, Mont.
