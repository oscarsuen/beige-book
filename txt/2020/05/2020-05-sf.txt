Wages declined at some firms, but many reported no changes in hourly rates or salaries. A Southern California hotel reduced workers' pay by up to 40 percent. Building materials manufacturers and transportation providers either suspended or postponed bonuses, merit increases, and cost-of-living adjustments. Some small businesses said that PPP loans helped them maintain their wages at current levels. A Seattle firm reported offering hazard pay bonuses to 87 percent of its workforce.
Activity in consumer and business services contracted noticeably. Transportation fell moderately with the exception of residential delivery services. Restaurants remained closed apart from those able to offer take-out alternatives. Hotels, sports venues, in-person educational institutions, daycare centers, and movie theaters remained largely nonoperational. Spending on most discretionary medical services halted, but demand for mental health and veterinary services remained robust. In the Pacific Northwest, consumers avoided cash heavy expenditures such as auto repair services. A contact in the Pacific Northwest also warned of reduced local government revenue collection and its implication for potential cuts in fiscal spending and public services. In the entertainment sector, demand for broadcasting and voice-over services increased.
Commercial construction activity declined notably throughout the District. Reports highlighted that weak business prospects for restaurants, hotels, and other commercial venues have severely depressed commercial construction and permitting across a large portion of the District. One contact in Idaho emphasized that commercial projects were only postponed, as opposed to terminated, mostly due to delays in the delivery of building materials.
