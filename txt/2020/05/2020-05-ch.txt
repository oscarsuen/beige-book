Contacts in the food services, entertainment, tourism, and recreation sectors expressed deep concern about the upcoming summer season, noting that social distancing requirements were likely to put substantial limits on occupancy.
There were, however, reports of low inventories of groceries, household products, and home improvement products. A number of manufacturers said that inventories were higher than desired. Capital expenditures declined, and many contacts said they were suspending capital spending for the remainder of the year. Contacts continued to spend to support telecommuting. Demand for transportation services decreased moderately overall, as lower long-haul volumes outweighed increases in local delivery services. Commercial and industrial energy consumption declined moderately, with lower usage by retail stores, restaurants, and the auto industry.
Residential construction in Michigan restarted in early May after being suspended in late March, but contacts were concerned about the availability of labor, in part because many workers had left the state during the suspension. Residential real estate activity decreased substantially. One contact noted heightened interest in moving out of urban areas. Home prices fell slightly, as inventories and the number of interested buyers both fell. Apartment owners reported fewer rent delinquencies than they had expected and believed generous unemployment benefits were helping. Nonresidential construction activity decreased moderately as most existing projects continued. Commercial real estate activity decreased significantly, with the largest drops in the retail and hospitality sectors. Prices were little changed, though contacts reported elevated uncertainty over how to price many properties. Rents fell modestly as vacancies and the availability of sublease space increased modestly.
May, there was concern over supply chains due to uncertainty about when factories in Mexico would reopen. Steel production declined precipitously, driven by large declines in autos and oil and gas. Demand for specialty metals decreased moderately, as reduced orders from autos and aerospace outweighed slight increases from the medical and defense industries. Orders for heavy trucks continued to decline from their peak last year. Manufacturers of building materials saw a modest decrease in shipments, while manufacturers of packaging materials reported a large increase in demand.
