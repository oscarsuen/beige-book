Also, some employers noted that while they didn't lay off staff, they did reduce the number of hours they worked. Others expressed difficulties retaining or rehiring workers because they had child or elder care responsibilities, or because it was more financially beneficial to collect unemployment insurance. While there were few reports of permanent wage increases, there were several reports of employers temporarily increasing wages to retain essential on-site staff, to match the amount employees could earn on unemployment, or to reduce absenteeism.
Ports and TransportationShipment volumes at Fifth District ports fell sharply relative to last year. Exports were hit especially hard, declining further in recent weeks from already low levels. Imports were down over the year but recovered somewhat since our previous report as China resumed shipments. Automotive shipments were particularly weak as manufacturers were shut down and low oil prices softened the West African market for used vehicles. Contacts expected both imports and exports to remain low in the coming months.
Trucking companies had a moderate drop in volumes since our previous report, and said volumes were down significantly from a year ago. Firms lost business from customers who were temporarily closed or faced decreased demand. Retail clothing, wine and convention-related shipments were especially soft. Some weakness was also attributed to supply-chain disruptions from overseas. Declines were partially offset by increased shipments of food, building materials, medical and cleaning supplies, and cardboard shipping boxes. Spot market rates fell sharply, and some companies had to remove trucks from the road.
Travel and tourism remained extremely weak since our last report, with sharp declines reported on a year-over-year basis. Many hotels closed temporarily and those that were open saw low occupancy, which mainly came from healthcare workers and construction workers. Some contacts expected demand for tourism to come back strong because of pent-up demand. In parts of the Fifth District, advanced hotel bookings were up over the year for later this summer. Restaurants struggled as some were able to continue carry-out business, but others had to close. As restaurants were allowed to reopen with limited capacity, some opted to remain closed as operating at low capacity would not be profitable.
Fifth District commercial real estate leasing softened moderately in recent weeks. Landlords worked with tenants on rent deferments. Retailers, restaurants, and salons were especially likely to miss payments. Office leasing was also weak, as many tenants asked for deferments, and businesses did not look for new space. Current projects continued, but speculative construction softened. Demand for industrial leasing, on the other hand, was high. Multifamily leasing also remained strong, and some landlords allowed tenants to extend leases without added fees.
Demand for professional services were mixed. For example, an accounting firms saw a modest reduction in business while a marketing company said sales were up, although the number of clients was down.
