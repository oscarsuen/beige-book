Across the District, tourism and hospitality contacts reported that revenue per available room had reached a historical low for April as a result of COVID-19. Most contacts were in the process of developing their reopening strategy which would include marketing efforts and implementation of social distancing and elevated sanitation, among other things. Firm reopen dates had not yet been determined and the general sentiment was that the recovery for this industry would be moderately slow.
Commercial real estate (CRE) contacts reported continuing challenges associated with the effects of COVID-19. Reports were mixed, as rent collections exceeded low expectations and investment activity continued to slow during the reporting period. Contacts continued to report a deceleration in new leasing inquiries, though leasing activity that was already in the pipeline appeared to be steadily continuing to move towards completion. Reports of a greater number of tenants seeking rent relief emerged. Declining tourism and travel conditions have had a significant impact on CRE activity across the District. Contacts reported that capital was readily available for financing stabilized CRE projects. Reports also indicated that accurately appraising property values has become much more difficult and anticipate this to last through the remainder of the year.
Reports indicated that widespread maintenance delays into the second half of the year will create added strain on limited maintenance contractors, staff, and equipment. Industrial construction contractors reported extensive project delays and cancellations. While some energy contacts expect demand to rise in late summer, many noted that the industry will still have to contend with crude oil oversupply and storage overhang. Utilities contacts reported decreased demand for power overall, largely from the commercial segment.
