On average, payrolls of staffing firms' placements appear to be down 40 to 50 percent across the District. Even business associated with essential food manufacturing and distribution was down over 10 percent. A Pennsylvania contact noted that a food manufacturer shut down for two weeks after an employee tested positive. Some staffing firms have trimmed their own staff; others have guaranteed staff full pay through June.
Multiple staffing contacts and firms from varied sectors reported that rising layoffs have not made it easier to attract and retain labor. Contagion fears and at-home child care needs have led some workers to stop showing up for work; those concerns plus unemployment benefits are also keeping workers from seeking other jobs.
Firms have reported a mix of wage strategies. Some firms reduced pay for their executives and/or managers; some issued annual raises and bonuses early. Other firms have added "appreciation" pay or "hazard" pay for hourly workers who must still report to work. Many salaried workers can telecommute – three-fourths of the firms noted an increase in their use of telecommuting. Contacts expect wage growth to moderate in the future.
According to several firms with global perspectives, supply chain issues with China have eased, and China is mostly back to work. One contact did note that a few plants shut down again, as demand from foreign customers waned. These contacts noted substantial declines of demand in southern Europe and several weakening sectors across the U.S., including oil field services, light metals, and food production and distribution that was oriented toward restaurants and group dining facilities.
Sales of new and used cars appear to have fallen by as much as 50 percent from February to March. From March 19 through March 26, our three states ordered dealers to stop sales, although they permitted selling parts and servicing vehicles. Delaware and New Jersey subsequently allowed limited sales.
Tourism has virtually stopped. A majority of hotels, resorts, and attractions have reported closing and laying off tens of thousands of employees. Most of Atlantic City's 26,450 casino workers were laid off when the casinos were shut down. As of March 28, a tourism analyst estimated that weekly travel spending had fallen 80 percent in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and 70 percent in Delaware.
Commercial real estate lending and home mortgages did not appear to be impacted yet. Bankers and brokers indicated that most deals that were already scheduled were completed. However, contacts expect fewer deals to be brought to the table going forward.
Banking contacts were busy negotiating loan modifications and loan deferrals, while deciphering new Small Business Administration rules and other programs available in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act recovery package, as fast as the regulations were being written. The bankers stated that liquidity was not a problem but would be a concern if the shutdown dragged on.
Real estate firms also noted extra hurdles with title work and inspections required to close transactions. However, most scheduled closings were finalized. Showings and sales have dropped off considerably in Pennsylvania despite switching to virtual showings. Contacts note that activity has held up in Delaware.
Philadelphia's commercial real estate construction fell 70 percent by the end of March – some contractors have no projects. After initially being shut down in Pennsylvania, commercial construction was allowed an exemption. Unfortunately, worker attendance is less than 50 percent on some projects. On the commercial leasing side, tenants are seeking lower rents, whether they need it or not. As with residential construction, deals already in the works have been finalized, but fewer new projects are coming forward now.
