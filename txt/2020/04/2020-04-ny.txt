Reports from business sectors were mostly quite negative to varying degrees. Contacts in manufacturing, retail, and leisure & hospitality reported particularly widespread staff reductions, while businesses in the information, finance, wholesale, and professional & business services indicated steady to modestly declining staffing levels. Many contacts noted that these reductions were largely furloughs or temporary layoffs.
Looking ahead, contacts in manufacturing, finance, and professional & business services said they expect staffing levels to hold steady from current levels, but businesses across all other sectors expected further staff cuts, on net.
Wages have been flat to lower since the last report. Businesses in the hard-hit leisure & hospitality and retail trade sectors reported fairly widespread reductions in wages, while contacts in other service industries indicated that wages were generally flat to down slightly.
Vehicle sales dropped to near zero in the second half of March, according to auto dealers in upstate New York, as the state shut down non-essential businesses. Many of these dealers hope to at least partially re-open before the end of April. While essential dealer service departments remained open, business for these services also slowed considerably.
Looking ahead, manufacturers said they expect activity to be unchanged from current levels, on balance, while wholesalers and transportation firms anticipate weakening activity. Businesses generally have slashed capital spending plans, with potential implications for some durable goods producers.
Stay-at-home directives have largely brought both leisure and business travel to a halt. An expert on New York City's tourism sector noted that almost nobody is visiting the city, and that New York City's hotel occupancy fell from roughly 72 percent to 15 percent by the end of March. Many hotels have closed temporarily, while others have repurposed some rooms as excess hospital space, and some as isolated office space.
Looking ahead, business contacts expressed great uncertainty, though there was fairly widespread pessimism. Those in leisure & hospitality expressed the bleakest expectations, while those in professional & business services tended to be the least pessimistic.
A major appraiser noted that selling prices of New York City co-ops and condos were continuing to decline through mid-March, especially at the high end. Given the lack of activity since, though, it is difficult to gauge more recent changes in prices and rents. Landlords are reportedly concerned about how many tenants are going to be delinquent on their April rentâ€”particularly in New York City, where a majority of residents are renters.
Commercial real estate markets across the District have also ground to a halt, with office, industrial, and retail leasing activity largely ceasing. Office availability rates and rents have not changed noticeably thus far, but real estate contacts have noted concern about collecting rent from commercial tenants.
New construction starts have essentially fallen to zero, and ongoing construction projects have paused, except where considered essential.
