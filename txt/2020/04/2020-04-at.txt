Some District firms reported cutting pay, eliminating bonuses, and reducing hours, in efforts to retain employees. However, high demand sectors, such as grocery, distribution, and warehousing announced increases in hourly wages or bonuses. Some companies still hiring have postponed pre-employment background checks like drug tests and finger printing, largely in an effort to reduce physical contact. Many contacts reported relaxing attendance policies and increasing paid time off and leave allowances. Some noted an extension of premium pay to essential workers or employees who deal directly with the public.
Tourism and hospitality contacts reported a massive decline in activity across the District as a result of COVID-19. By mid-March, most major conferences and conventions had been cancelled or postponed, the majority of tourist attractions were temporarily shuttered, and hoteliers reported historically low occupancy rates. Several contacts noted that hotels with locations close to hospitals were being considered for conversion for medical use and shelters for COVID-19 patients or hospital staff.
Commercial real estate (CRE) contacts reported a deceleration in new leasing inquiries amid the COVID-19 pandemic. However, leasing activity that was already in the pipeline appeared to be moving forward. Declining tourism and travel activity significantly impacted CRE in the hospitality and retail sectors. Investment property sales slowed markedly due to issues associated with the slowing of financing from commercial mortgage backed securities and non-bank lenders; however, contacts reported that capital was readily available at banks for the financing of CRE projects. Banks reported that originations continued in the CRE space. Reports of tenants seeking rent relief have begun to emerge.
