Wage pressure fell overall due to the unprecedented increase in worker layoffs. Among firms cutting workers, there were also some reports of wage freezes and cuts for remaining workers. For certain industries seeing strong demand—grocery chains, manufacturers of critical equipment—there were isolated reports of wage increases to meet customer demand and to compensate workers for greater health risks.
Commercial real estate was lower since the last report. Significant layoffs and slower overall activity in March was expected to continue into the coming months, creating upward pressure on vacancy rates and downward pressure on leasing costs across all real estate categories, but particularly for retail and office space. However, the swiftness of changing market conditions made it hard to discern the full effects across different property categories and geographic regions. Residential real estate was modestly lower, but varied geographically. Home sales in rural parts of Minnesota are reportedly "very busy—as if there was no pandemic in place," said an industry contact. At the same time, Minneapolis-St. Paul and other metro centers in the state were seeing "significantly reduced activity."
