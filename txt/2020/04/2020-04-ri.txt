Fifth District trucking companies reported fairly steady business in recent weeks as declines in retail shipments were offset by increased demand from other parts of the market. Shipments of food, laptops, and cigarettes were particularly high. Spot market rates rose slightly as demand shifted across sectors. Some companies struggled to find enough drivers, as a small number of drivers were quarantined and newly trained drivers could not get their licenses while the DMV was closed. Also, low fuel prices helped lower operating costs.
The tourism industry contracted significantly in the Fifth District in recent weeks. Hotel occupancy fell to unprecedented levels, leading several hotels to close and others to operate with minimal staff. However, some people continued to visit rentals and vacation homes. Many restaurants closed when dining in was disallowed, while others tried to remain open for take-out and delivery. For many restaurants, especially those not structured for takeout, this was not a long term solution but a way for them to sell their perishable inventory.
Fifth District commercial real estate leasing decreased moderately since our last report. Office and retail leasing declined sharply as companies reported no new leases. Existing office and retail tenants looked to break leases or asked for rent reductions and deferments, with many claiming force majeure. However, industrial leasing remained fairly strong, as companies looked for extra storage space for accumulating inventories during temporary closures. Brokers reported mixed conditions in multifamily. Existing construction projects continued, but new construction starts declined.
