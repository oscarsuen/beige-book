A Japanese automaker announced that it will build its first U.S. pickup truck plant in southern Indiana. The $700 million plant will open in 1998 and employ at least 1,300 workers. State incentives for the plant amount to almost $30 million. A firm distributing industrial uniforms reports that it will bring more than 300 jobs to western Kentucky when it opens a new distribution center there within the current year.
Moderate sales increases are reported by some contacts. One from northwest Mississippi reports that businesses targeting specialty markets, like gourmet stoves or home decorating, have exhibited strong growth in the last few months. Another in eastern Arkansas reports that sales at some local manufacturing firms are up between 14 and 21 percent year-to-date through late 1995 over the same period last year. A building materials supplier, though, reports sales through late 1995 are essentially unchanged from the year before. A dealer in heavy farm equipment remains upbeat even though sales in 1995 were slightly below 1994's level because 1994 was an exceptionally good year.
A recent survey of firms in various cities nationwide by a temporary employment agency reports that 13 percent of St. Louis firms and 33 percent of Memphis firms plan to hire new employees during the first quarter of this year. Nationally, 20 percent of surveyed firms indicated they will hire this quarter. Counterbalancing these reported expansions, a major St. Louis-based retailer, that is currently reorganizing under Chapter 11, announced it will close 500 stores nationwide, 16 of which are in the St. Louis area, as part of its bankruptcy resolution.
