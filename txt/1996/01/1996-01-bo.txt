Business activity in the First District continues to expand slowly, with sectoral patterns following those previously reported. Retail contacts again report mixed but generally disappointing results; manufacturers remain more upbeat, with many experiencing solid growth. Price pressures are reportedly minimal. Temporary employment continues to expand. Most sectors and areas in the region's commercial real estate market are holding their own. The insurance industry saw sales pick up in the fourth quarter.
Most vendor prices remain stable, including the prices of lumber, leather, and paper, which earlier had increased dramatically. One contact cites recent price increases on fabric and foam upholstery. None of the contacts reports increases in customer prices. Gross margins held or declined slightly for most of 1995, but profits were generally down because of sluggish sales. Contacts do not expect to expand employment and many plan cuts in capital spending in 1996.
Many contacts report little or reduced cost pressure, while selling prices are flat on average. Prices for chemicals, rubber, resins, lumber, and fabrics are reported to have stabilized or declined. Paper and metals costs continue to increase, however. One-third of the respondents express concern about profit margins in view of the competitive pricing environment.
Capital spending trends vary widely, but about one-half the contacts report aggressive programs to modernize or expand their facilities. Compared to a year earlier, U.S. employment is flat to up slightly at one-half of the firms contacted. Another one-quarter report making substantial net new hires, while the remaining one-quarter have cut back through attrition. Businesses that are hiring report that strong competition is forcing higher compensation for information systems specialists. In addition, a couple of contacts located outside major metropolitan areas indicate difficulties finding qualified production workers. Manufacturers report average wage and salary increases of between 2 and 4 percent, which they tend to view as modest.
Most contacts expect reasonably good outcomes in 1996, given an environment of moderate GDP growth and little inflation. Several have modified their sales projections, however, because of sluggish automotive sales or financial difficulties at retail chains.
