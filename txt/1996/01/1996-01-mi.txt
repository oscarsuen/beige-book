The Ninth District economy continues to move forward, but activity in some sectors is feeling a chill. Several factors remain positive. Continued tightness in labor markets indicates that many firms are not experiencing any slackening in activity. Farm income and spending show improvement, and petroleum exploration and metal mining are strong. Winter tourism businesses are reaping the benefits of favorable weather for snowmobiling and skiing. There are few indications of price pressures.
But while the economy continues to grow, the rate of growth apparently is slowing due to weakness in a number of areas. Builders' order books are getting thinner. Consumer spending on vehicles and general merchandise is subdued. Manufacturers describe diminishing orders for a variety of goods. Output of paper and other forest products is slowing in response to lower demand.
Natural resource industriesNatural resource industries are generally robust, with the exception of the forest products sector. Oil and gas exploration continue to boom. The drilling rig count of 19 in North Dakota in early January is double that of a year ago and over three times that of early 1994. Output at iron, copper and gold mines shows only seasonal slowing.
But forest product production is slowing. "A number of paper mills are scheduling some selected downtime," says the head of one Minnesota logging firm. Paper prices are dropping for the first time in two years and many mills are slowing production. Reduced demand reportedly is slowing output in other forest product areas. Lumber output has slowed, but oriented-strand board producers generally continue to produce at capacity. They face lower prices which industry sources attribute to a combination of new capacity in other regions of the country and to somewhat reduced building activity compared to a year earlier.
"We are sort of treading water, and we don't see it getting better very soon," says a business analyst at an electronic device manufacturer in Minnesota. The outlook is even less positive for a maker of components for trucks and heavy equipment: "Our new orders are just falling off a cliff," says the company's CEO. The bloom is definitely off the rose for many manufacturers; earnings of publicly traded corporations are slowing and industrial electrical use in Minnesota and South Dakota is falling below five-year trends in several categories. Nonelectrical machinery production seems particularly slow.
Auto sales show little change from late fall, generally slow with some regional variation. Sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks show the most strength; conventional sedan sales are the weakest.
News of price decreases outnumbers that of increases. Reductions in paper and packaging prices are reported for the first time in 18 months. Ferrous and nonferrous metals are also reportedly down from a year ago and there are no problems in deliveries. Grain prices remain high, and soybean prices have increased since harvest, but continuing low livestock prices have kept food price increases low. Gasoline and other motor fuels continue about 5 cents per gallon below year-earlier levels.
