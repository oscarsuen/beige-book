The First District economy is expanding at a moderate pace. Retail results in March and early April were mixed, ranging from double-digit sales gains to double-digit declines from a year earlier; some of the laggards saw a pick-up in recent weeks. Manufacturers are more upbeat, with most reporting solid first-quarter gains. Inventory levels are not out of line, according to both retail and manufacturing contacts. With few exceptions, selling prices and input prices are said to be stable. Commercial real estate markets in most of New England are improving slowly. Insurance sales are increasing.
Inventories generally are in line with plans. Many respondents indicate long-term efforts to reduce their inventory-to-sales ratio, however, and some firms in the textile and paper products industries report modest degrees of overstocking. One contact expects customers to stock packaging materials in anticipation of a price increase for polyethylene.
Selling prices and materials costs are reported to be largely stable. Some respondents have raised prices to reflect higher-cost steel and other metals or to improve margins. Paper and wool prices reportedly have softened after rising considerably last year.
About three-quarters of the respondents have increased employment during the past year, but future trends are expected to be more mixed. Some manufacturers report difficulties filling software and telecommunications positions, but none indicates generalized wage pressures. Investment plans vary widely; over one-third of those contacted mention efforts to rein in capital spending.
Rental rates have been going up slightly or have leveled off in most markets. However, contacts view these price movements as too small to make up for the large price decrease that took place over the last several years. While downtown Boston and the greater Boston area have been doing very well, Maine, Rhode Island, and Connecticut have seen only very minor increases in activity. In all the states, the retail market seems to be the slowest to recover, while the industrial sector and apartment building sales are stronger.
