A few industries reported declining activity. A producer of heavy construction equipment experienced weaker-than-expected orders in recent months and reported that production had been cut to levels below the end of last year. An analyst for the heavy-duty truck industry reported rising dealer inventories and cuts in build plans, although the industry is postponing major adjustments until the summer shutdown period due to better-than-expected gross new orders. Auto assemblies in the District declined sharply in March due to a strike against a major automaker, but few businesses reported being impacted by the strike unless they were a direct supplier to the plants affected. Auto production bounced back in April as strike-related plants reopened and efforts were made to recapture some of the lost production.
