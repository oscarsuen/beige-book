A snack food maker is expanding into northeast Arkansas where it will initially hire 200 to 400 workers by early next year. A large Missouri manufacturer of chemicals and related products reports a noticeable uptick in demand for materials used in the housing and auto sectors; an even larger increase is noted for agricultural-related products. A bank card processing center is expanding to southwest Missouri, bringing 750 jobs by year's end. A new Tunica County, Miss., casino has already hired 600 workers and is looking for 3,000 more. A concern, though, is that there are not enough workers in the area to satisfy this demand.
Other contacts also report tight labor markets. Restaurant and other food service establishments are having a difficult time finding staff. One restaurant delayed its opening for two months because it could not find enough help, and a Tennessee hotel had to hire labor from overseas. The temporary employment industry is also encountering staffing problems.
Production has slowed at some firms, though, usually because of company consolidation or cost cutting. A national railroad is shutting a diesel shop in Missouri to cut costs; most of the 240 workers will be offered transfers, however. A contact in the paper industry reports that production of coated paper has been halted because of excess inventory. Sales of bleached paper, used in milk and juice cartons, are strong, though.
