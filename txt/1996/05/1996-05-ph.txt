Reports from various sectors of the Third District economy indicated that business activity was moving up slightly in April. Around one-third of the manufacturers surveyed reported some gains during the month, although producers of building materials noted recent declines in sales. Retailers said sales were picking up modestly with the beginning of the spring season. Auto dealers described the sales rate in April as good, although a bit below their expectations. Bankers noted some increased commercial loan demand and a modest increase in consumer lending. Tourism in the District has been healthy, and contacts in resort areas said advance bookings for summer vacations have been strong. Among service industries, computer consultants and service firms reported increased hiring and contracting for computer network installations.
In general, area manufacturers reported they were working down inventories and planned to continue to do so, but there were some reports that inventories in the paper industry were rising above desired levels. Local manufacturers noted some increases in input costs in April, and they expect some additional increases in the prices of purchased supplies and materials over the summer. Manufacturing employment remained nearly steady in April: nearly two-thirds of the local firms surveyed noted no changes in employment levels or working hours, and the number of firms adding workers was matched by the number making reductions in their work forces.
Auto dealers generally reported that sales in April were running at a healthy rate, although a bit below their earlier expectations. Some General Motors dealers said their sales were limited by the strike at a parts plant and attendant production cutbacks in March. Most dealers for all makes indicated that their inventories were at satisfactory levels.
