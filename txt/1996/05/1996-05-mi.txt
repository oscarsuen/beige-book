The pace of economic growth in the Ninth District is picking up somewhat after perceptible slowing in late winter. Vehicle sales are improving after a midwinter slump and there are some reports of increases for general merchandise. Manufacturers still have some slack, but a number of firms report that orders are once again increasing. Soaring grain prices are improving prospects for farmers, though optimism is tempered by a cold, late spring and depressed livestock prices. Once again, construction is very strong in most parts of the district. Metal mining and oil drilling and exploration are at the highest levels in this decade. As throughout the winter, tourist business varies by location, with eastern areas of the district fairly upbeat, but Montana and the Dakotas less so. Skilled employees remain hard to get, and unemployment rates arelow. There are few reports of wage pressures. Price increases are concentrated in grains and energy-related items such as fuels and basic plastics. Inventories are reportedly normal for most firms except for paper products, some slow-moving automobile models and a few manufacturers.
A fourth consecutive strong year for large, publicly let projects is developing in Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota. Contracts let through March are about 25 percent above the same period last year. State highway and bridge projects predominate, but construction of schools, municipal buildings, churches and private commercial building are all strong.
Markets for existing real estate are also active. March 1996 sales of existing homes were up nearly 13 percent over March 1995 in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area and realtors report continued strength in listing and sales in April. Strong markets for existing housing are similarly reported in several other areas.
Continuing increases in grain prices are improving farm incomes, although many rural elevators continue to report difficulty in securing railroad cars to transport grain to ports. Most observers expect higher prices to persist through harvest, and farmers reportedly are responding by planning the highest plantings of major crops in years. Supplies of inputs such as fertilizer, pesticides and seed are generally adequate, although some seed suppliers report that farmers are already trying to exchange longer-season varieties for shorter-season ones, and that short-season varieties will be extremely scarce if adverse weather persists.
Energy price increases, particularly for spot buyers of natural gas and for trucking firms, are the most widely noted price pressure. Some manufacturers who use polyethylene or polystyrene for packaging report rapid price increases from mid-February on, and low inventories by producers. "But cardboard prices are just in a freefall," reports one. Cash grain prices are soaring, and flour prices are following with only a slight lag. But a price war among breakfast cereal producers and plummeting livestock prices have thus far limited perceptible food price increases for consumers.
