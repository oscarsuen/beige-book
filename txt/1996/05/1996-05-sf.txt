Reports from 12th District survey respondents indicate a healthy pace of economic activity throughout most sectors and areas in the District. Retail sales reportedly have firmed slightly since earlier in the year, and services continue to expand at a brisk pace. Manufacturing activity appears mostly solid. The District banking and real estate markets are very active, although the real estate sector in Los Angeles has not fully recovered from its lengthy slump. Price and wage increases continue to be moderate overall, with the notable exception of gasoline prices in California. However, respondents expect higher national inflation in the near term.
Among services, demand for communications services continues to rise rapidly; this includes both telephone and computer communication. Transportation demand also is robust. Both volume and prices are increasing on flights to and from Portland, and shipping port expansion is planned there. Shipping activity also is vigorous in Southern California, although a recent sharp rise in gasoline prices is affecting the costs of land transportation in the state.
For the District's key high-tech electronics sector, respondents noted that growth has decelerated in recent months, and prices of semiconductors (particularly computer memory chips) remain at low levels. However, inventories of semiconductors and personal computers are coming down at rates characterized as "acceptable," and substantial expansion of semiconductor manufacturing capacity is planned in the Portland area.
