Unemployment remains low in most parts of the District and is particularly low in manufacturing-intensive northwestern Ohio. Reports of labor shortages are still heard in some areas, although perhaps less frequently than at this time last year. Still, wage increases are running only in the 2 percent to 3 percent range.
Weather conditions this spring have been cool, but mild, and early crop production estimates are favorable. The combined effect of good harvests and substantially lower inventories compared to last year suggests the potential for a profitable agricultural sector in 1996.
Cost pressures remain remarkably light given the continued high production levels seen here. Area purchasing managers report that prices have risen on only a limited assortment of commodities, including some metals and most energy goods. Only a few commodities are noted to be in short supply.
Auto sales were mixed across the District during March and April. Several dealers attribute much of the poor sales performance to colder-than-usual temperatures and most were optimistic that sales would improve this spring. Dealers are continuing to use special financing plans and factory incentives. Current interest rates seem to be having little or no effect on sales, but most dealers are quick to note the potential for a drop-off should interest rates rise appreciably.
The General Motors strike appears to have had only a small effect on sales, although inventory stocks were noticeably depleted. In most cases, the inventory decline helped trim excess supplies (although one dealer saw inventories plunge to a 4-day supply and reportedly lost some sales as a result.) The majority of dealers describe their stocks as "desired" or "slightly lower than desired," with the typical inventory ranging between a 50- and 75-day supply.
Competition for credit is keen and spreads between deposit and lending rates are said to be narrow. However, profit reports from District banks last quarter were good. Moreover, while a continuing deterioration in credit quality is noted, there are no reports of any significant rise in either commercial or consumer debt delinquencies.
