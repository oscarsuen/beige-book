Second District economic conditions have weakened somewhat over the past two months, despite a modest pickup in job growth. Reports from retailers were very mixed in March and April, with year-over-year changes ranging from outright declines to double-digit gains; but on balance, sales were weaker than in February and a bit below plan. Job growth has accelerated somewhat, but a corresponding increase in labor force participation has kept unemployment rates from declining. Finally, banks' delinquency rates, which had been rising, leveled off in the past two months, while demand for commercial and industrial loans picked up.
Unseasonably cold weather reportedly had a moderately negative impact on sales, particularly in March. One contact attributed February's strength-and March-April weakness-to earlier-than-usual tax refunds. Apparel, especially women's, generally outperformed other merchandise categories considerably stronger for upscale apparel than for more moderate lines. Most retailers are holding prices steady, though reports suggest somewhat less discounting than a year ago. Cost for merchandise and labor are generally flat.
Reports on the residential real estate market were mixed in April. Contacts in downstate New York continue to experience a better spring selling season than last year-both traffic and sales are up. However, builders report no recovery in the Albany area (which has been depressed by state government downsizing), and only a moderate pickup in the western tier of the state in recent weeks. New home sales across upstate New York remain weaker than a year ago; while the inventory of new homes is very low, a large supply of existing homes for sale is depressing the overall market.
New Jersey builders say that sales and traffic have slowed a bit in recent weeks, following a first-quarter pickup, and that sales are lower than a year ago-one contact described the market as "listless", noting that while consumer pessimism has diminished, so has the sense of urgency to buy. Apparently, the recent rise in mortgage rates has, thus far, not been much of a factor.
Average loan rates, which had been trending down, leveled off in April--only 35 percent of respondents reported declining loan rates, down from 76 percent in February; residential mortgage rates have increased, on balance. With average loan rates leveling off, more banks than previously reported a widening of spreads between average loan and deposit rates. Delinquency rates have decreased or remained the same at more than 80 percent of the banks. Banks were more or just as willing to lend in April as in February, and credit standards have generally remained the same.
