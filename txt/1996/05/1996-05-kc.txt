Most banks held their prime rate steady last month, and few expect to change their prime rate in the near future. A few banks raised their consumer lending rates slightly, but most expect no change in the near term. Some banks also tightened their lending standards slightly.
Large supplies of beef and competing meats continue to hold down cattle prices, while soaring grain prices boost feed costs. As a result, many district cattle feedlots and ranches are operating at a loss. With financial losses accumulating and forage supplies limited by the continued dry weather, some district ranchers have begun to reduce the size of their herds.
District bankers generally expect the quality of their agricultural loan portfolios to weaken somewhat in 1996. High grain prices will help offset crop losses caused by the drought, shoring up incomes for grain producers. But bankers expect profits to be scarce in the district cattle industry in 1996. Overall, district bankers expect strong balance sheets to enable most farmers and ranchers to withstand the rough year.
