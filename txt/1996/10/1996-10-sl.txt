The pace of District economic activity has changed little since our last report.  Sales and employment levels are generally up, and inventories are, for the most part, at or near desired levels.  Contacts from around the District continue to report tight labor markets.  Firms that have experienced price increases for materials have generally still not been able to pass them along to customers.  Residential construction permit levels are ahead of last year, with recent upticks in most areas.  Total loans outstanding at large District banks rose slightly during the past two months, led by consumer lending.  Prices received by District milk producers have risen substantially over the past 12 months, although they are expected to fall somewhat before the end of the year.  Record rice yields were reported in many areas, while some District cotton producers report a higher-than-usual outbreak of boll rot.
Contacts from a paper products company and a poultry processor report plant expansions, resulting in additional employment.  A package delivery service has increased the size of its planned expansion, which will dramatically increase local employment and capacity.  The District's heating and cooling industry is again posting a record year for shipments and profits.  Firms in the District's apparel industry, though, are still feeling the bite of layoffs, predominantly because of price competition and inventory pressures.  More than 900 jobs will be eliminated by year's end.
The largest bank in the Eighth District, Boatmen's Bancshares, agreed to merge with NationsBank of North Carolina.  The precise employment consequences of this merger remain uncertain, although plans call for St. Louis to be the headquarters for the bank's western operations and to house the combined company's trust business.
With a hard frost yet to hit most of the northern reaches of the District, the corn and soybean crops, generally speaking, have reached full maturity.  Nevertheless, the pace of the corn and soybean harvest, at least in parts of Illinois and Indiana, is well below normal; in general, it is on or ahead of schedule elsewhere.   Parts of the Arkansas cotton crop have been substantially afflicted with boll rot.  An industry contact, however, reports that the Mid-South cotton crop will probably have only slightly higher-than-average boll rot this season.  Rice yields in parts of Arkansas were reportedly the highest on record.
