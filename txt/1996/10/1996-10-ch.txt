The Seventh District economy continued its moderate pace of expansion in September and early October, while wage and price pressures were generally constrained.  Retail sales growth in the District remained at or above national averages, due in large part to strong apparel sales.  Overall construction activity was robust, led by strong growth in commercial construction.  Manufacturing activity continued at high levels but the Canadian auto strike in October was causing minor disruptions for a few auto suppliers.  Employment growth continued at a moderate pace with shortages of skilled labor persisting.  Improving crop prospects began to moderate the decline in livestock production in September and October.
Several machine tool producers experienced a plateauing of orders in September and early October, even though order levels have been somewhat higher than expected at the beginning of summer.  A producer of heavy construction equipment noted that dealers were very optimistic about sales going into next year, although foreign competition (aided by a strengthening dollar) has resulted in a rollback of virtually all of the modest price increase announced earlier in the year.
The October Canadian auto strike began to have an impact almost immediately on about a dozen GM plants in the District, but only a few have been closed.  Independent auto suppliers reported little effect through the first three weeks of the strike.  If the strike continues into the last week of October, several GM suppliers expect that their sales to GM will be halted.  If the strike is perceived to be nearing a conclusion, several auto suppliers stated that they expected to continue production and stock the parts, based on the expectation that auto assembly plants will work overtime to recapture any lost production.  One auto analyst expects workers to return to work within two days of a settlement.
