Economic growth in the Second District has moderated somewhat since the last report.  Sales at large retailers slowed a bit in September but were back above plan in early October.  The commercial real estate and multi-family housing markets continued to strengthen in the third quarter, while thesingle-family sector lost some momentum.  Private-sector job growth moderated in September, though the general trend is still fairly positive. The region's manufacturing sector gave mixed signals in September: strong reports from purchasing managers belie an acceleration in manufacturing job losses.Price pressures remain generally subdued, aside from New York City apartments and hotel rooms. Finally, an increasing proportion of banks report rising delinquency rates in all major lending categories.
Retailers report stable input costs but some increase in effective selling prices.  Merchandise costs are generally flat, though a few contacts cite cost reductions resulting from intensive negotiating; wage growth remains steady and modest.  However, effective selling prices are up moderately, as retailers are discounting less aggressively than a year ago a trend that is expected to prevail through the holiday season.
The District's residential real estate markets were mixed in the third quarter.  Realtors in New York and New Jersey report that sales of existing single-family homes slowed from the second quarter's brisk pace.  Builders in New Jersey describe the market for new single-family homes as steady; while traffic is fairly good, potential buyers still seem to be concerned about corporate layoffs and relocations. Despite a modest rebound from depressed 1995 levels, construction of single-family homes is still low.
In contrast, the multi-family sector continued to gain momentum.  Rising demand for apartments in and around New York City along with lean inventories is evidently boosting prices and spurring new construction, which had been mostly dormant since the late 1980s.  A quarterly survey coveringprime Manhattan co-op and condo sales shows prices up 11 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier.  Over the same period, permits to build apartments in down-state New York surged more than three-fold, pushing the cumulative year-to-date total to a seven-year high.
The survey results suggest mixed trends in loan rates.  Residential mortgage rates increased; consumer loan and nonresidential mortgage rates remained fairly stable; commercial and industrial loanrates declined slightly.  Average deposit rates continued to rise.
