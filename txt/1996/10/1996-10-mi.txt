In late fall, blue economic skies prevail in the Ninth District as moderate-to-strong growth continues in most sectors.  September vehicle sales were markedly strong, and some indicators point to favorable overall retail sales in a very competitive sector.  Construction remains an economic workhorse with stamina in all district states.  The 1996 crop is turning out well, despite localized harvest difficulties due to wet weather.  Natural resource industries follow the same pattern as earlier in the year: strong oil exploration and drilling, strong iron ore production and stable output in most forest products.  Manufacturers report good, but not exceptional, business.
Very tight labor markets are producing increasing reports of wage hikes, and form a drag on possible output for some firms.  But few price pressures for goods are evident at any level.  Tourism continues somewhat slow, especially in the Dakotas and Montana.
Through September, highway and other publicly let infrastructure construction continues brisk in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Dakotas, but in Montana has dropped a bit from 1995 levels.
Cattle and hog slaughter prices are slightly higher than in early summer,  and the situation for cattle producers, while still bad, is not as grim as many had anticipated in late spring.  Higher than usual proportions of cull cows in total cattle slaughter indicates that needed adjustments in the beef sector are taking place.  Milk prices are up sharply in response to reduced output from higher feed costs.
Bankers responding to the Minneapolis Fed's third quarter survey of credit conditions indicate that farm income and spending has generally increased from earlier in the year, except in Montana.  Bankers also report that Minnesota, North Dakota, and eastern South Dakota farmers are increasing their machinery purchases compared to the previous three years. Repayment rates have improved, and interest rates are unchanged from early summer.
For general merchandise, separating same-store performance and manager perceptions in general retailing from overall consumer spending continues difficult in a sector that has experienced major additions to capacity in recent years.  Many retailers report business only slightly stronger in early fall than in prior periods, but nonvehicle sales tax revenues generally indicate more strength than individual firms' sales figures.
These tight conditions bring increasing reports of compensation increases, in base pay for some workers and in increased benefits, bonuses and incentives for many others.  The personnel director for a major Minnesota financial institution says, "Good database people can pretty much write their own check." Fast food outlets in Missoula, Mont., reportedly are offering $6.50 per hour for starting part-time help, a level previously unheard of in that area. But some other employers report moderate pay increases.  Over 80 percent of business owners in Michigan's Upper Peninsula who responded to a Minneapolis Fed poll expect that wages would increase 2 percent to 3 percent in the next 12 months.  Moreover, a survey of compensation managers for Minnesota firms indicated pay increases averaging 4 percent.
In spite of these reported pressures in labor markets,  price increases in markets for raw materials, intermediate goods and final goods generally remain scattered and small.  The drop in agricultural commodity prices over the summer eased pressures on food prices, with the exception of dairy products.  Petroleum costs remain above year-ago levels, and trucking firms continue to complain of the resulting squeeze on their operating margins.
