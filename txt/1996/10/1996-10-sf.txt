Most contacts from the 12th District reported strong economic growth in their areas and industries in recent weeks.  The District manufacturing sector continued its solid expansion, and the pace of retail goods and service sales was brisk.  Construction and real estate sales activity was robust in most regions, although some deceleration was reported in several fast-growth states, and the Southern California market continues to be weak.  Banking respondents reported good conditions for their industry throughout the District.  With regard to the outlook, respondents' generally sanguine views were tempered only by expectations of increasing inflation. Although wage and price pressures in the District reportedly were moderate overall, upward pressure on the wages of entry-level workers in some areas recently has been added to existing upward pressure on wages for some categories of highly skilled workers.
Substantial residential building activity, home price appreciation, and rent increases were reported for Silicon Valley, the high-tech manufacturing center in the southern part of the San FranciscoBay Area, and some pickup in permits for lower-priced "entry level" homes was reported for Southern California.  For California as a whole, however, any existing strength primarily was in nonresidential markets; residential construction and sales remain low at the state level.  Although building and sales activity continued at high levels and wages for construction workers rose noticeably in the District's fast-growth intermountain states and Oregon, several respondents in these states reported recent slowing in residential construction activity and plans.  Reports also suggested some slowing in commercial construction in Idaho, Arizona, and Nevada.
