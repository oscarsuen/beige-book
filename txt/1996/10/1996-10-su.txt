Moderate expansion of business activity characterizes the economy in most Federal Reserve districts, but on balance the pace of growth reportedly has slowed somewhat. Slower growth is reported in the Southwest and along the eastern seaboard except for New England. The Midwest continues to show moderate to strong growth. Boston and San Francisco, two districts which had lagged much of the rest of the nation through the first half of the 1990s, indicate an improved performance. Although there are few indications of significant price increases for raw materials, goods or services, reports of upward pressure on wages are more widespread.
Reports on the auto sector are mixed. They are particularly strong in the Minneapolis district, where favorable crop incomes and overall economic strength bolstered September vehicle sales. For Cleveland, sales are up compared to a year ago, but somewhat below early 1996. Kansas City saw some slowing in September, but dealers expect sales to be "fairly strong over the remainder of the year." For Philadelphia, vehicle sales are reportedly steady, and for Dallas sales have slowed more than expected.
Tourist spending is similarly mixed, with greatest strength along the East Coast. Tourism "remains strong" in New York. Richmond reports substantial strength in inland areas not affected by hurricanes. Atlanta lists brisk activity in Florida, the Mississippi Gulf Coast and New Orleans, and notes an upbeat outlook for tourism and convention activity. The Upper Midwest is less favored, with Minneapolis reporting a slow or somewhat disappointing summer season in its states.
However, obvious strength in these districts contrasts with Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas, where manufacturing was steady to mixed; Philadelphia, where manufacturing gains in October were less widespread than in summer; and New York, where surveys of purchasing managers reported sharp improvement in local manufacturing in September. Several districts report localized effects from the auto workers strike in Canada, but none foresee significant or long-term effects.
A number of districts report that manufacturing inventories are generally normal to somewhat below normal, and show little indication of either production bottlenecks or of weakening demand.
However, slowing is apparent in the Southeast. Richmond describes some decrease in residential construction overall, but notes increases in materials prices and a shortage of skilled construction labor in North Carolina. In Atlanta, construction activity has fallen below year-earlier levels.
Market conditions for residential and commercial real estate are mixed, with strength in the Northeast and West (New York, Boston, San Francisco) and some slackening in the Southeast (Richmond, Atlanta) and Midwest (Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City).
Conditions are less favorable for livestock producers; a number of districts report continued losses for cattle ranchers. San Francisco notes a decline in beef exports to Japan. But there are some glimmers of improvement: Minneapolis reports that beef prices are not as bad as had been anticipated, while Kansas City says that profitability has returned to the feeding end of the sector and that "feedlots are filling quickly."  Minneapolis and St. Louis report sharp increases in milk prices, in response to higher feed costs. The Chicago district has had more apparent cuts in hog and milk production than elsewhere but says that the rate of decline has slowed as feed costs have dropped.
In the rest of the country, more pay increases are evident. Cleveland identifies "steady pressure to increase wages" for some specialties, while Richmond sees wage increases in low-unemployment areas and reports expectations of upward pressures in the next six months. Chicago says that "wage pressures appear to have remained concentrated at the lower end of the pay scale, and ... this pressure may be intensifying." For Kansas City, "reports of rising wages increased," and in the Dallas district "there were more reports of labor shortages leading to wage pressures." San Francisco describes wage pressures as "moderate overall," but points to "upward pressure on the wages of entry-level workers... has been added to existing upward pressure on wages for some categories of skilled workers." The Minneapolis district apparently has the tightest labor markets, and notes "increasing reports of compensation increases."
In contrast to some proliferation of wage increases, reports of price increases for raw materials, goods and services remain limited. Boston reports some increases in chemicals prices, but notes that half of manufacturers report no change in selling prices.  New York reports that merchandise costs are generally flat. The cost of raw materials has not increased for most industrial firms surveyed by Philadelphia. Retailers contacted by Cleveland "have not experienced any substantial price pressures" and "note price declines in consumer electronics." Most of Atlanta's contacts expect no change in material or finished goods prices. St. Louis relates that some firms have experienced increases in raw materials prices but have been unable to pass them along, while other firms reported recent declines in raw material prices. From Minneapolis, price hikes generally remain scattered and small, while Dallas indicates "more reports of lower prices than in the last beige book," although energy and some other materials were higher. Specific exceptions to this general pattern of low price pressures include Richmond, where manufacturers report increasing prices for finished goods and raw materials in September, and Kansas City, where retail prices held steady but those for some manufacturing and construction materials rose.
