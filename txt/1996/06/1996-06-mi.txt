Economic growth in the Ninth District continues to quicken in late spring. Construction is strong in virtually all parts of the district. Natural resource industries, except for paper, are robust. Vehicle sales reportedly have improved from earlier in the year and general merchandise retailers report satisfactory business. Agricultural producers are generally optimistic in spite of late planting caused by adverse weather. Similarly, tourism got off to a late start due to cold, wet weather, but business owners and state tourism officials anticipate a good season. Manufacturing continues mixed, but on balance shows some invigoration. Except for products derived from grains or petroleum, there are few reports of price increases. Difficulty in securing needed workers is the most common complaint voiced in regard to labor markets.
In forest product industries, lumber mills and oriented-strand board plants are busy, but paper production continues down from a year ago and well below capacity.
Hog prices are higher than anticipated, shielding producers somewhat from the effects of sharply higher feed costs. Conditions for beef producers remain grim, and bankers report that they expect the number of ranch liquidations to rise perceptibly this year.
Interest rates on farm loans rose slightly in the second quarter, and bankers' expectations of loan repayment, farm income and capital spending continue to improve in most areas except where cattle ranching predominates.
"We have the person who posts price changes doing filing," says a Minnesota plumbing supply wholesaler who describes a few increases in copper and polyvinyl chloride pipe as offset by declines in prices of furnaces and other manufactured items. While fuel prices have received much attention, the average pump price for gasoline in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area at the end of May was only 6 percent above year-earlier levels. Grain prices remain at historic levels in nominal terms, and flour price increases now roughly parallel those of wheat after lagging somewhat earlier in the year. But there is little evidence of price pressure at the supermarket. Beef is frequently on sale and aggressive promotions of breakfast cereals and some other processed foods have helped minimize food price increases.
