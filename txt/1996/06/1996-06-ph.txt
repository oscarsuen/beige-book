Economic activity in the Third District was increasing moderately in late May and early June, according to reports from various industry sectors. Manufacturers were continuing to see some gains in new orders and shipments. Retailers indicated that sales had picked up seasonally and were running a bit above the year-ago pace. Auto and light truck sales remained healthy, according to dealers, but sales of heavy-duty trucks have been slow. Bankers generally described lending as just steady overall. Residential realtors and home builders have seen increased sales in recent weeks. Commercial real estate markets were improving also, according to property managers. They reported a slight decline in office vacancy rates and some firming of rental rates since the beginning of the year, and they said that demand for warehouse space remained strong.
Most area manufacturing firms reported that the prices they were paying for inputs and the prices they were charging for their products had been steady. Firms purchasing agricultural commodities continued to note that they were facing higher costs for raw materials, but most have not passed on these higher costs in the prices of their own products.
Auto dealers said sales of cars and light trucks have been good in recent weeks, in part because of the availability of manufacturers' rebates and price reductions to clear out end-of-model-year vehicles. Dealers continued to indicate that sales of used autos have been strong. A less positive trend characterizes the market for heavy-duty trucks, where sales have been flat.
Demand for industrial space, especially warehouses, has remained strong in the region, according to realtors. Although the vacancy rate for industrial space has shown little change since the beginning of the year, commercial real estate agents said many currently unoccupied buildings are obsolete and were not attracting occupants. Instead, companies requiring space were contracting for new buildings, and there was some speculative construction as well.
Residential real estate sales have picked up in the region this spring, and housing construction has increased. Realtors said demand for new homes was relatively stronger than demand for existing homes and this was limiting price appreciation for existing homes that were being sold. Builders and realtors reported that purchases by first-time home buyers were underpinning sales of townhouses and homes at the lower end of the price range. Realtors said recent increases in mortgage rates did not appear to have had a significant effect on prospective home buyers' willingness to buy.
