The First District economy expanded moderately in April and May. Manufacturers generally report solid growth, residential real estate had a strong first quarter, and temporary employment firms and money management businesses continue to grow. By exception, retailers report disappointing sales, citing continued upheaval in the region's retail sector. Input prices are mostly stable, while some manufacturers are raising selling prices slightly.
Most vendor and retail prices remain stable; an exception is lumber prices, which have risen steeply in the last six weeks. Gross margins typically are holding or improved, while profits vary greatly. Contacts are satisfied with their inventory levels. Only one respondent reports major increases in capital spending and employment for this year or the next.
During 1995, paper users had been accumulating stocks aggressively in anticipation of rising prices; these holdings have been reduced, and one contact says further declines are warranted. Most other manufacturers believe their inventory levels are appropriate, although inventory/sales ratios continue to adjust to structural changes. For example, one manufacturer of consumer durables indicates a need for higher stocks of finished goods because retailers are reluctant to hold inventories in advance of the holiday season.
Over half of the contacts are achieving small increases in selling prices, while most report that prices of raw materials are flat to down. The prices of paper and plastics, in particular, have fallen from year-ago levels. By contrast, prices of foam, polyester yarns, glues, and some metals are said to be creeping up.
Almost half the sample report increased employment over the past year. Low rates of local unemployment are causing some firms to recruit professionals from other parts of the country. Wages and salaries are said to be rising in the range of 2 to 5 percent.
