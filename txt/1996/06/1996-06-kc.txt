Most banks report a slight increase in total deposits, with gains in MMDAs, large CDs, and small time and savings deposits. Demand deposits, NOW accounts, and IRA and Keogh accounts held steady.
None of the respondent banks changed their prime rate last month, and none expect a change in the near future. Most banks also held their consumer lending rates steady and anticipate no changes in the near term. Lending standards were generally unchanged.
The district cattle industry remains trapped between low cattle prices and high feed costs. As a result, district feedlots have trimmed production schedules, and many are operating at less than full capacity. With demand for young feeder cattle down, district ranchers are reducing the size of breeding herds. Few ranchers are exiting the industry altogether, but many are trimming herds by aggressively culling lower quality cows.
High crop prices should offset crop losses for many district farmers and boost incomes for those who harvest normal or near normal crops. Nevertheless, with a poor wheat crop in prospect and losses accumulating in the cattle industry, agricultural bankers expect a sizable increase in the number of farm loans to be refinanced this fall. Overall, some erosion in equity is likely this year for many district farmers and ranchers, but strong balance sheets should enable most to survive the tough year.
