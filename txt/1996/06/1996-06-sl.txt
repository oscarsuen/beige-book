Many District auto dealers report recent increases in sales levels; however, some Louisville dealers report a slight decline in April sales. Almost half of the surveyed dealers have been using rebates and other incentives more than usual, and some St. Louis and Memphis contacts credit these programs for their recent sales increases. Although a few contacts have noticed that consumers are purchasing used rather than new cars, other dealers report no significant substitution. Most surveyed dealers anticipate this year's sales to be the same or better than last year's.
Many firms, especially in the southern parts of the District, report slight declines in last month's and year-to-date sales levels over the same period last year. A representative from a textile company, however, reports that sales are up strongly over last year and are expected to continue on this path. Many contacts report that their inventories are too high and plan to cut prices to reduce stocks. A National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) survey of District firms in May, though, found that one-fifth of surveyed firms plan to increase their inventories during the next six months; about one-sixth plan to cut inventories. Many contacts also report that, in most cases, they still cannot pass along increased materials' prices to consumers because of competition. According to the NFIB survey, however, about one-fourth of the respondents have increased prices over the past three months, and about one-fifth plan to increase them in the next three months.
