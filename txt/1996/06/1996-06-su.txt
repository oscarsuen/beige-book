Service activity continued to expand in districts reporting on this   sector. In the Boston district, demand for temporary workers   continued to strengthen. Service producers in the Richmond district   indicate that employment rose in May, although revenues declined   slightly. The San Francisco district reports strong demand for   computer-related services, telecommunications, and long-distance   trucking. The tourism industry remained robust. The New York district reports   hotel occupancy in New York City remained at a 16-year high. In the   Richmond district, tourism activity picked up in May despite wet   weather. The Atlanta district reports strong gains in attendance at   Florida hotels and theme parks and rising gambling revenues in   Mississippi. Also, the approaching Olympic Games have apparently   boosted passenger traffic at Atlanta's Hartsfield International   Airport. In the Minneapolis district, the tourism industry holds   optimistic expectations for the summer, even though the season's   start was delayed by cold, wet weather.
Residential real estate activity generally strengthened in most     districts, including New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis,     Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Signs of     sluggishness emerged in some districts, however. Housing sales     slowed in some parts of the Boston and New York districts. Builders     in the Richmond district report declining buyer interest in new     homes, although housing sales rose. In the Chicago district, wet     weather slowed homebuilding and sales, but builders expected a     stronger third quarter.Commercial real estate activity continued to improve in most     districts. The Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta districts report     declining office vacancy rates, higher rents, and gains in     commercial construction activity. The Minneapolis district reports     solid gains in contracts for large projects. In the Dallas district,     the tightest supply of suburban office space in a decade was pushing     up rents. A few districts report a weakening in commercial activity.     The New York district reports office vacancy rates edged up in New     York City in May. In the St. Louis district, commercial construction     slowed in some areas of Tennessee and Arkansas.
Overall loan demand rose in most districts, although demand for       commercial loans and consumer loans varied among the districts.       Demand for commercial and industrial loans was strong in the New       York, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco districts, and       was flat to down slightly in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond,       Atlanta, and St. Louis districts. Demand for consumer loans was       strong in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City,       and Dallas districts, and flat to down slightly in the New York,       Philadelphia, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts. The Cleveland       and Chicago districts report intense competition among lenders.       Mortgage lending and refinancing declined in most districts. In the       Boston district, assets managed and employment at investment       management firms strengthened.
Agriculture was hurt in several districts by unfavorable weather and         low cattle prices. Wet weather delayed the planting of spring crops         and slowed crop development in the Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis,         Minneapolis, and Kansas City districts. The Cleveland and Chicago         districts report that more favorable weather recently enabled corn         and soybean planting to progress. Recent rains improved crop         conditions in some parts of the Richmond district. The wet weather         arrived too late in the Kansas City district, however, to avert an         expected sharp decline in winter wheat production caused by drought         earlier in the year. In the Dallas district, drought sharply reduced         the expected size of the winter wheat crop and trimmed pasture and         forage supplies. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San         Francisco districts report unfavorable conditions in the livestock         industry, due to low cattle prices and high feed costs.Energy activity improved somewhat in the Minneapolis, Kansas City,         and Dallas districts, despite declining energy prices. The         Minneapolis district reports stronger iron mining activity and mixed         conditions in the forest products industry.
Prices advanced for some raw and intermediate materials in several           districts, especially for building materials, petroleum-based           products, and agricultural commodities. Evidence of rising prices           for finished products and at the retail level was less widespread.           The Boston, Kansas City, and Dallas districts report higher prices           for building materials, including lumber. Prices for packaging           materials, some plastics, machinery, and steel were up in the           Atlanta district. Higher wheat prices pushed up flour prices in the           Minneapolis district, but otherwise had little effect on retail food           prices. Manufacturers in the Boston and Richmond districts report           rising product prices, but flat to slightly lower materials prices.           In the St. Louis district, some manufacturers report difficulty in          raising product prices due to highly competitive markets. Retail           prices held steady in the Boston, St. Louis, and Kansas City           districts and rose more slowly in May than in April in the Richmond           district. Retailers in the New York district, however, indicated           that a decline in price discounting was boosting effective retail           prices. Most districts continued to report tight labor markets for both           entry-level and skilled workers. The Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis,           and Kansas City districts report a tight market for retail workers.           In the Boston and Chicago districts, the number of temporary workers           shifting to permanent assignments was increasing. Markets for           skilled laborers remained tight in the Chicago, St. Louis,           Minneapolis and Kansas City districts. The Boston district reports           that a tight local labor market has prompted area businesses to           recruit professional workers from other parts of the country.
Reports of rising wages are scattered, despite widespread tightness in labor markets. The Boston district reports rising wages in manufacturing. In the St. Louis district, some fast-food establishments offer wages above the minimum wage and include a signing bonus. The approaching Olympic Games were pushing up entry-level wages in the Atlanta district.
