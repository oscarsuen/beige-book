Reports from major business sectors in the Third District in February indicated that economic activity has picked up after a storm-induced slowdown in January. However, the gain has not been sharp, and, according to these reports, business in the region has been relatively steady in recent weeks. Manufacturers generally indicated that while shipments were up a bit, new orders were flat. Retailers said sales had rebounded from January when snowstorms kept shoppers out of the stores, but most merchants indicated they were not making up all the lost sales and were merely back on a steady track. Auto dealers gave similar reports. Bankers said lending was either flat at their institutions or growing sluggishly. There were some positive reports from the real estate sector. Residential real estate agents and home builders were experiencing some increased traffic and greater sales. Commercial real estate agents said demand for office space appeared to be firming, and leasing and construction of industrial buildings were moving up.

Expectations vary within the Third District business community.   Manufacturers anticipate some improvement in the next two quarters.   Retailers do not foresee immediate gains, but they are hopeful the   pace of sales will improve in the spring. Auto dealers expect only a   steady sales rate. Bankers report no evidence that loan demand will   accelerate soon. However, real estate agents expect continued modest   improvement in both residential and commercial markets.
Looking ahead, most of the Third District manufacturers contacted in   February expect demand for their products to pick up by summer. On   balance, they foresee a rising pace of orders and shipments, but   they do not expect order backlogs to move up strongly. Likewise,   they anticipate only very slight increases in employment.
Auto dealers also noted a pickup in sales in February following a   poor January. However, they said sales were running at a pace just   matching last year's at this time, and they expect that rate to   continue in the months ahead.
Commercial realtors said demand for industrial space, especially for   warehouses and distribution centers, has been increasing. They   attribute this to moves by several firms to consolidate activities   into large buildings in the region. Realtors expect further   increases in land development activity and construction for these   types of buildings.
