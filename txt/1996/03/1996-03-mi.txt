Overall, economic activity in the Ninth District economy remains   moderate, but there is widespread feeling among businesspeople that   the pace of growth is slowing. On one side of the coin, construction   continues strong and builders expect another active season. Rising   grain prices have generally increased optimism in the agricultural   sector, in spite of the squeeze that such prices put on ranchers and   on farmers who raise livestock as well as grain. Tourist businesses   in eastern areas of the district report good activity, but Montana   and the Dakotas have had a disappointing season. Metal mining output   remains strong, but some profit margins are eroding as prices for   nonferrous and precious metals soften. Labor markets remain tight   and unemployment rates low, but there are few reports of wage or   price pressures.
On the other side of the coin, manufacturers continue to report   slackening orders. Retailers are experiencing sluggish sales of a   wide range of durable and nondurable goods. With the exception of a   few areas, auto dealers describe sales as slow. There are increasing   reports of paper mills cutting production. Agricultural bankers in   towns where cattle ranching predominates express alarm about the   degree of price declines for feeder cattle and expect that some   ranchers will choose or be forced to liquidate their operations.
However, this optimism on the crop side is at least partially offset   by depressed livestock prices. The problems of livestock producers   have been exacerbated by rising grain prices; the hog-to-corn and   cattle-to-corn price ratios are at their most unfavorable levels in   decades. Cow-calf producers are the end of the whip that is being   cracked, as higher feed costs drive down prices for feeder cattle.   Western South Dakota and ranching areas of Montana are particularly   hard hit. Bankers and ranchers in these areas expect the level of   voluntary and forced liquidations to rise dramatically in 1996.
As the winter ends, winter wheat conditions in Montana and South   Dakota are generally good, and soil moisture levels in most areas   are excellent. A few areas in the eastern Dakotas continue to suffer   from excess moisture and localized flooding.
Automobile sales are similarly slack in most areas. A western   Montana dealer reports that 1995 sales were down 12 percent from   1994 and that "our outlook for 1996 is very cautious." Some areas   report better sales; oil and wheat producing areas of North Dakota   and Montana seem to have stronger-than-average vehicle sales. A   Minneapolis-St. Paul dealer, however, describes business as "so-so." On balance, consumer buying seems to be quite slow.
Many Ninth District commodities, including copper, paper, lumber and   livestock, have decreased in price. Grains are the strong exception.   Because slaughter livestock prices continue low, there is little   evidence that sharp increases in grain prices have had effects at   the consumer level. But some voices of concern are heard. "I just   can't believe the press isn't following these grain prices," says a   commodity analyst for a major Minnesota food manufacturer. "We   potentially face a supply situation much worse than 1973-74."
