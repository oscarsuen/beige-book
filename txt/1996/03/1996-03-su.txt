Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve districts suggest the national economy grew modestly in January and February. Over half the districts cite moderate economic growth or continuing solid levels of economic activity. Most of the others mention recent improvements, largely reflecting rebounds from weather-related slowdowns earlier in the year.
Accounts of manufacturing activity are mixed. More than half the   districts report gains in at least some industries or sub-regions,   but Boston, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas suggest   production is either level or growing more slowly than in the last   report. Retail results generally improved in February, but in   several districts these improvements represent only a partial   recovery from weak sales during the holidays and January.
Wage and price pressures are generally described as subdued,   notwithstanding observations of tight labor markets in several   districts. Wages are reported to be increasing at a modest pace.   Retail prices are rising only slightly if at all. Most commodity   prices are said to be steady, stabilizing, or increasing very   little; a few are falling.
Retailers in a majority of districts are optimistic that sales will   pick up in the next few months. The outlook for those in the   Cleveland, San Francisco, Dallas, and Minneapolis districts is more   guarded. Upward movements in retail prices continue to be limited.   Reports from Boston, Atlanta, and St. Louis indicate vendor prices   generally remain stable.
Auto dealers in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Cleveland, and Kansas   City districts report improved sales in February, following a   disappointing January. Dallas notes sluggish sales in both months,   leaving inventories larger than desired. contacts in the Chicago,   Cleveland, and Kansas city districts express more optimism about   this spring's auto sales than those in Dallas, Minneapolis, and   Philadelphia.
A number of districts report growing demand for capital goods,   notably industrial machinery, with Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago   citing a boost from exports. Sales of electronic and computer-  related equipment appear to be rising, although Minneapolis reports   a slowing rate of growth for computer components, and Dallas notes a   drop-off in demand for memory chips and microprocessors. St. Louis   and Dallas indicate robust markets for cement. Auto-related and   apparel demand are widely reported to be sluggish, and paper mills   are experiencing declining sales according to contacts in several   districts.
Manufacturers throughout the country report little or diminished   materials cost pressures. Paper prices in particular are falling,   and lumber prices are either falling or have ceased to rise. Several   districts note growing wage pressures or tight markets for some   categories of manufacturing workers. Overall wage inflation   reportedly remains moderate, however. Philadelphia and Richmond   report recent declines in finished goods prices, while most other   districts indicate little or no increase. Several districts   attribute the modest size of upward price movements to competitive   conditions in addition to the lack of cost pressures.
Commercial real estate markets have also experienced increased   activity. New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas report rising   demand for commercial space. Vacancy rates are said to have dropped   in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco districts.   Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco   report increased commercial construction in their districts.
Contacts in all districts anticipate a strong and active spring   season. Despite some concern about interest rates and about   overbuilding in selected areas, respondents are optimistic about   both residential and commercial real estate activity during the   upcoming months.
In other natural resource industries, conditions are mixed. Iron   mines in the Minneapolis district shipped at the highest level in   over a decade, while output from nonferrous mines stayed stable.   Energy prices are reportedly volatile, with natural gas and fuel oil   prices fluctuating at high levels, while crude oil prices are   relatively weak. Dallas and Minneapolis report strong gas and oil   exploration activity, but in Kansas City and Dallas, the operating   rig count remains low.
