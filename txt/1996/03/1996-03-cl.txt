Unemployment in the District has been trending mostly upward since   last spring, particularly in the manufacturing-intensive regions   such as northern Ohio. In more diversified economies, including   central Ohio and eastern Kentucky, labor markets have generally been   steadier. Still, most regions continue to post jobless rates that   are under the national average and low relative to historical   averages. Survey data suggest new hiring plans are running about the   same as this time last year -- perhaps a sign that labor markets are   expected to firm a bit this spring.
Although some firms continue to see labor shortages, wage and cost   pressures are reportedly light. Wage growth appears to be comparable   to the rise in the cost of living--in the 2% to 3% range. Area   purchasing managers are noting only moderate (and limited) commodity   price increases.
Auto and auto-related manufacturing is still soft, and inventories   remain somewhat high. Industry sources anticipate additional   production cuts unless a sustained improvement in consumer auto   sales occurs. Heavy truck manufacturing, which has shown a 10   percent drop in production since last summer, has recently posted   small gains in orders.
Other capital goods industries are reporting stronger numbers. Many   of the industries we contacted saw double-digit sales growth last   year, and early indications for 1996 suggest a continuation of that   trend. Firms with significant export markets are noting particularly   large orders growth.
Inventories are near desired levels, however, and although retailers   are reluctant to predict future performance based on activity over   the past two months, many still report a positive near-term outlook.
Inventories are "desired" to "slightly heavy," ranging from a 40- to   90-day supply. However, many dealers are anticipating March to be a   stronger month, so heavier inventories are not particularly   disconcerting.
Delinquency rates continue to rise, though, and several banks are   expressing concerns about credit quality. Deposit growth remains   moderate, with transaction deposits basically flat. Some drain of   deposits to money market funds was noted. Major-market banks have   witnessed a further shrinking in margins and are anticipating a   substantial slowdown in profitability this year compared to 1995.
