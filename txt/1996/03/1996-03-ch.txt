Economic activity in the Seventh District remained at   relatively high levels in January and February, although growth   remained slow and was uneven across sectors and sub-regions. Despite   adverse weather in February, retail sales improved somewhat from a   soft January. Housing and construction activity remained relatively   strong in the District, buoyed by a pickup in first and second-time   home buyers. Manufacturing and banking activity, however, has become   increasingly mixed since the beginning of the year. Job creation in   the District continued to outperform the nation as a whole in early   1996 and labor markets remained very tight, while increases in wages   and prices remained subdued.
