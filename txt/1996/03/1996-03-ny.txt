Reports on Second District economic conditions were mixed, but on   balance were more positive than In recent months. Beginning with the   more upbeat developments, retail sales strengthened considerably in   February. Moreover, robust leasing activity led to improvement in   Manhattan's commercial real estate market. Finally, aggregate loan   demand has strengthened over the past two months. In contrast,   reports on homebuilding and manufacturing activity were mixed. The   market for new homes In the New York City-Northern New Jersey area   improved, while the upstate market did not. Conversely,   manufacturing output Increased in the Buffalo region but declined In   the New York City area during February.
The market for new homes has picked up in the New York City and   Northern New Jersey areas, but upstate New York's depressed market   showed no improvement. Homebuilders in the New York City area, which   includes Long Island and the lower Hudson Valley, report that sales   are higher than a year ago; one contact described the market as "perky". Similarly, contacts in Northern New Jersey report some   pickup in both traffic and buying activity in the past six weeks,   but this is compared to an exceptionally weak market in late 1995.   Also, some expressed concern that the pickup In activity may just be   a temporary spike, with the recent uptick in mortgage rates   motivating potential buyers with a sense of urgency.
Homebuilders in upstate New York report no recent improvement; they   say demand for new homes continues to be depressed by corporate and   government down-sizing and pervasive consumer pessimism. Moreover,   high inventories of unsold existing homes -- partly due to   corporations unloading homes of relocated employees onto the market   -- are pushing down prices and competing with the new-home market.   Only the low-end of the market, particularly subsidized units, is   performing reasonably well. Contacts in both New York and New Jersey   believe that the market is too weak to support any increase in   selling prices.
Nearly two-thirds of District manufacturers polled in a recent   Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey expect unit sales to   increase over the next six months, with exports expected to grow   more rapidly than domestic sales. Ninety percent of the respondents   anticipate that prices will either remain unchanged or decline;   however, one-quarter reported that they had raised prices recently.   Wages are expected to rise 3 to 4 percent and capital spending will   be similar to that of 1995.
Consumer confidence for the Middle Atlantic region (New York, New     Jersey, and Pennsylvania) rebounded in February, after falling to     its lowest level in more than 2 years. Still, residents remain     exceptionally pessimistic about job prospects. More large     corporations have announced workforce reductions in New York State:     TRW, General Electric, Nationwide, Bausch and Lomb, Pratt and     Lambert, Deluxe Corporation, Reader's Digest and UPS announced     layoffs totaling nearly 2,000 workers.
Average loan rates were steady or lower at nearly all of the   reporting banks, resulting in a narrower spread between lending and   deposit rates at almost 65 percent of the banks. Loan delinquencies   were higher at 20 percent of the banks and steady at 70 percent,   with the nonresidential mortgage segment experiencing the largest   increase in delinquencies. Although several of the survey   participants tightened credit standards, nearly 60 percent of the   banks were just as or more willing to lend than they were two months   ago.
