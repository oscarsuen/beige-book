High feed costs and low cattle prices continue to hold down profits in the district cattle industry. Most district feedlots continue to earn modest profits, due to low prices for young feeder cattle.

Agricultural bankers expect continued weak profits in the cattle industry to limit improvement in overall farm income in 1996, even though higher crop prices may boost profits for crop producers.
