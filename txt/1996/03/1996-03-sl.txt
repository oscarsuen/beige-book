Contacts in northern Mississippi generally report that sales for the past month or two are at levels comparable with a year ago, but signs of new growth have appeared. A producer of prefabricated metal buildings and several furniture manufacturers report unchanged sales in January, but have seen slight increases in February. Expectations are for less than 5 percent growth in the coming months. A brick manufacturer reports record sales for 1995, noting that this pace has continued into 1996. Demand for mobile homes has been particularly strong in Mississippi, requiring several local manufacturers to add employees. Firms targeting specialty markets, like gourmet stoves and home decorating, report that sales are remaining steady at high levels.
In Arkansas, a cement supplier recently had to purchase 15 new delivery trucks to meet its high demand. A maker of glass containers reports that sales since the beginning of the year are up about 12 percent over the same period last year. A company producing military and civilian boots will take over a recently closed shoe factory in western Tennessee and hire about 150 of the previously laid-off workers. A producer of truck transmissions and a maker of outdoor leisure products, however, have seen year-to-date sales fall 2 to 5 percent from last year.
In Missouri and Kentucky, reports are more mixed. A large defense contractor in the St. Louis area announced layoffs for about 470 workers because of lulls in production for some products. At the same time, this company received a new fighter jet contract worth almost $600 million, which will secure other jobs for the time being. An auto producer has reopened its Missouri plant as scheduled, employing about 2,400 people. A printing company in southern Illinois, trying to reorganize through bankruptcy, closed in late February, eliminating 850 jobs. Another high-sulfur coal mine in Illinois is closing, leaving behind 200 jobs. A major department store retailer, however, moved its credit department from Maryland to St. Louis and created 350 new jobs.
The cold weather also hurt livestock producers. For example, Mississippi catfish farmers reportedly suffered substantial losses because of ponds freezing over. On the positive side, cotton analysts said the cold weather destroyed a significant percentage of the boll weevil population. An increasing number of farmers indicate that the uncertainty surrounding the 1996 Farm Bill legislation has delayed final plantings. As a result, many farm lenders are reportedly proceeding at a cautious pace. Delta farmers are expected to reduce planted cotton acreage by about 10 percent this spring. In response to high grain prices, most of this acreage will be planted to corn or soybeans instead.
