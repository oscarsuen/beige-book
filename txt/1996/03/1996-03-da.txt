Eleventh District economic activity continued to expand at a   moderate pace in January and February, although weaker demand led to   falling prices or inventory build up in several industries. Most   contacts do not expect to change employment growth, and several   major expansion plans remain in place. Manufacturing orders   continued to weaken, but production remained at moderate levels.   Demand for business services expanded. Retail sales were sluggish in   January but picked up in February. Lending activity was unchanged,   with the exception of an increase in residential real estate.   Construction activity continued to expand, but some apartment and   retail projects were scaled back because of concerns about   overbuilding. Energy activity was at a high level. Agricultural   conditions worsened.
Contacts reported falling prices for several products, although   energy prices were higher and there was continued upward pressure on   wages for skilled workers in some industries. In February, paper and   box prices fell about 8 percent from the previous month, and   contacts expect prices to fall another 5 to 10 percent over the next   3 to 6 months. Semiconductor prices had dropped "precipitously" since the last beige book, and stiff competition forced computer   manufacturers to pass lower input costs to their customers.   Petrochemical prices were pushed to low levels as slower demand,   particularly for olefins, led producers to dump products on the spot   market. Contacts expect any significant economic upturn to push   chemical prices back up, however. Lower livestock prices outweighed   a slight increase in crop prices, leading to a 1.0 percent drop in   the January Texas All Farm Products Price Index from the previous   month. Retailers reported little change in selling prices. Input   costs were higher for apparel products, but selling prices were   unchanged. Weather extremes, and changing expectations about Iraqi   oil re-entering the market, kept crude oil and heating fuel prices   swinging. Prices for most energy products, particularly natural gas   and fuel oil, were high and volatile during the past two months.
Manufacturing orders continued to weaken, but production remained at   moderate levels. Demand had slowed for paper, boxes, apparel,   primary metals, petrochemicals and semiconductors. Inventories were   up for paper, apparel, primary metals and some types of   semiconductors. Producers reported a slight increase in demand for   computers and specialized semiconductors, but demand for memory   computer chips and microprocessors dropped off significantly in the   last 6 weeks. Overall, semiconductor sales were weaker than   expected, and contacts expect demand to increase at a slower pace   than in 1995. Petrochemical markets continued to soften. Chemical   producers said there had been no significant inventory build up and   sales were still profitable, which is unusual when demand is weak.   Cold weather boosted demand for refined products, although rising   crude prices kept profits mediocre. Low inventories of crude forced   refiners to purchase crude on the spot market to raise output and   take advantage of high product prices. Producers reported a slight   pickup in demand for oil field machinery and lumber, and demand   remained steady and strong for cement and fabricated metals.
Demand for business services continued to expand at a good pace.   Accounting firms said demand was strong. Activity at temporary firms   picked up in February after a seasonal slow down in January.   Transportation firms reported steady cargo volume and a slight   increase in passenger traffic.
Retail sales were sluggish in January but picked up in February.   Retailers were cautious about drawing conclusions from stronger   sales in February, what a contact referred to as "one short month." District sales were reported to be about even with the rest of the   country after several months of reports that sales were slower than   the nation. The change may have been a result of an improvement in   sales comparisons along the Texas-Mexico border, rather than any   relative change in consumer spending. Dealers reported that auto   sales were sluggish in January and February, leaving them with   larger than desired inventories.
The financial services industry reported no change in lending   activity, with the exception of an increase in residential real   estate. Contacts said that the increase was spurred by lower   interest rates and was mostly due to refinancings. Residential loan   demand continued to decline in Laredo, however, where economic   activity has been sluggish since the peso devaluation. District   lenders are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for loan demand   over the next 3 to 12 months and expect all types of lending to   increase. Contacts reported that there is a lot of discussion about   further mergers and acquisitions among financial services companies.
Construction activity expanded, but some apartment and retail   projects were scaled back because of concerns about overbuilding.   Lower mortgage rates boosted sales of new and existing homes. Demand   for commercial space remained high, and industrial demand was very   strong. While the construction of office space is sparse, some   contacts said rising office occupancies in the suburbs may spur new   construction in 1996.
Energy activity remained at a high level since the last beige book.   Demand for oil services and equipment continued to strengthen,   thanks to offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and around the   world. Oil services contacts reported that strong demand had boosted   profits well above expectations. Higher capital budgets for   exploration from integrated companies are expected to lead to   another good year in 1996. The domestic U.S. and Texas rig count   continued to be low, however, operating at levels comparable to this   time last year.
Agricultural conditions worsened in January and February. Continued   drought led to more than 350 fires which destroyed more than 20,000   acres of pasture land. Hay shortages still were reported in many   areas. Supplemental feeding of livestock continued and rising feed   prices were cutting into profits. As planting gets underway, some   farmers expressed concern about having adequate water to produce a   good quality yield.
