Contacts from across the District report that commercial and multifamily real estate markets continue to improve. Low vacancy rates and higher rents continue to propel new apartment and office development.

The retail market remains strong in most areas, but several contacts report an increase in vacancy rates after some stores went out of business following the holiday season.
