The Seventh District economy, as in our last report, expanded  at a moderate rate in October and early November, while price pressures remained largely  in check.  Consumer spending appeared to have rebounded from a sluggish September,  and regional retailers reported that they were aggressively seeking seasonal workers.  Housing activity continued to slow moderately, although most contacts continued to rate  the market as strong.  Manufacturers were operating at very high levels and indicators  suggest a near-term pickup.  Banking activity remained strong despite some softening in  commercial and industrial lending.  Very tight labor markets persisted, while overall job  growth in the District lagged that of the nation.
While still above year-ago levels, retail sales  remained relatively flat in early November, following October?s improvements.  Several  large retailers attributed overall sales gains to strength in apparel sales, aided partly by  the onset of cold weather.  Home appliance and electronic sales were soft compared to  earlier months, but retailers expect a pickup in December.  Inventory levels were  considered to be in good to excellent shape by retailers.  Several retailers noted that there  will be a big push in promotional activity ahead, mainly because November sales targets  will be hard to achieve with Thanksgiving coming so late in the month.  One retailer,  trying to maintain market share, reported plans to increase their price-discounting  promotions.  Most retailers, however, appeared to be focusing on boosting advertising to  attract customers as early in the holiday season as possible.  Retailers contacted remained  very optimistic about sales during the holiday selling season (despite fewer shopping  days), with Midwest sales expected to outperform other regions of the country.  One  major retailer felt that sales for the holiday selling season as a whole would not be  affected by the late Thanksgiving because many consumers start their holiday shopping  around mid-December.
Housing activity continued to slow in the District,  but most contacts reported that the market remained very strong.  One of the region?s  largest realtors reported that October?s existing home sales had decreased from the torrid  pace earlier in the year, but it was still their second best October ever.  New home sales  also declined in October and early November in most areas but, again, remained at very high  levels.  A national survey of home builders suggested that the Midwest?s early November  sales continued to decline slightly from the late summer?s weather-delayed gains.  Builders noted a sharp drop-off in foot traffic, causing several builders to lower their  expectations for the remainder of 1996 as well as the first quarter of 1997.  Among  building material suppliers, one major wallboard producer reported that shipments to the  Midwest remained very strong, noting that there is about a three-month lag between  changes in housing starts and wallboard shipments.  This producer reported that the  industry was able to push through a modest price increase in September and has  announced another for December.  If it holds up, as the industry expects, it would be the  first time in several years that the industry was able to push through an increase this late  in the year, a sign which this contact said indicates the strength in the market.  Activity  on the commercial side of the real estate market picked up slightly in recent weeks, due  in large part to declining interest rates.  One contact also reported that commercial  refinancing activity was increasing.
Despite some disruptions from the auto strikes,  manufacturing activity remained strong in October and early November, with some reports  suggesting a slight pickup in the pace of expansion.  Several purchasing managers'  surveys indicated moderate increases in October and November from already high levels  of overall activity in September.  New orders were particularly strong, but inventory  building was also evident.  However, prices paid remained relatively flat and, in one area  surveyed, delivery times were shortening.  A sharp increase in new orders of heavy-duty  trucks was reported by the industry for October, with orders strength continuing into  November.  Heavy ordering occurred from the major haulers, something that was absent  a year ago due to already huge backlogs at that time.  A producer of heavy construction  equipment reported that unit sales for the industry in October were slightly above year-  ago levels.  Appliance shipments, which declined in September on a year-over-year basis,  rebounded in October and appeared to be holding up in November.  Steel orders into the  first quarter are strong, but new capacity coming online (albeit more slowly than the  industry expected) is holding down price increases.  Although a slowdown in auto  production from the third quarter was widely expected, several auto suppliers reported a  drop in their shipments related to auto production cutbacks during the GM strikes.  A  major supplier of chemicals noted a plateauing of demand in recent weeks that was at  least partly linked to the auto strikes.  Despite solid sales growth so far this year, this  producer also reported that they have staunchly resisted price  increases from their raw material suppliers.
Lending activity remained strong in October and early  November, but growth in most areas of the District has plateaued.  On the commercial  side, several large regional banks described loan demand as flat to slightly down.  Most  of the recent activity has been driven by mergers and  acquisitions, with little currently going to  new plant and equipment purchases.  However, some increase in inventory  financing was also noted.  On the consumer  side, lending activity was still increasing,  but at a slower pace than two months ago.  Several medium-sized banks reported that  home equity and home improvement lending  was accounting for much of their activity.  However, several area bankers cited  lengthening terms on auto loans and less  equity being put into loan transactions as an  indication that consumers were getting  stretched out.  A consumer finance  institution reported a rise in revolving credit  balances, which also was interpreted as a  potential sign of an increasingly debt-  constrained consumer.  However, this  contact emphasized that overall credit  quality in the Midwest remained very good.  Several financial institutions reported some  tightening of standards, but also indicated  that much less was required in their  Midwest markets.
The District?s labor markets  remained very tight in October and early  November, with shortages in some sectors  becoming particularly acute.  Retailers have  been finding it especially difficult to attract  holiday help this year.  A recent direct-mail  promotion in Michigan advertising a retail  "jobs fair" received a minuscule one percent  response rate.  Retailers in the state have  teamed up with the state employment agency  in a promotional effort to recruit seasonal  workers.  In addition, a temporary help  agency in one of the District?s large metro  areas reported that orders were already  coming in for tax help (accountants,  business analysts, etc.) in mid-November, a  month earlier than in past years.  Perhaps  because of historically low unemployment  rates, most sectors? job growth was well  below the national average (retail trades  being an exception).  Construction  employment remained strong, while home  builders in several areas reported that  shortages of skilled labor persisted.  Manufacturing employment levels  continued a pattern of bouncing up and  down slightly from month to month, with no  trend evident in either direction.  However,  a national survey of hiring plans indicated  that more manufacturers in the Midwest  plan to increase their payrolls in the first  quarter of 1997 than was reported a year  ago.  A contact at a national temporary help  agency reported that margins were being  squeezed in the Midwest due to demands for  higher wages from workers and lower  prices from clients.
