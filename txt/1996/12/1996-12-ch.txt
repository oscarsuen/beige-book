The Seventh District economy, as in our last report, expanded  at a moderate rate in October and early November, while price pressures remained largely  in check.  Consumer spending appeared to have rebounded from a sluggish September,  and regional retailers reported that they were aggressively seeking seasonal workers.  Housing activity continued to slow moderately, although most contacts continued to rate  the market as strong.  Manufacturers were operating at very high levels and indicators  suggest a near-term pickup.  Banking activity remained strong despite some softening in  commercial and industrial lending.  Very tight labor markets persisted, while overall job  growth in the District lagged that of the nation.
