The New England economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Most FirstDistrict manufacturers are posting solid gains, retailers report scattered pick-ups in activity, andpersonnel supply firms continue to grow, but at a less hectic pace than in the recent past.  Theregion's residential real estate markets are steady and growth continues at money management firms.Prices remain generally stable, contacts say, while wages are rising 2 to 6 percent and someemployers note selective hiring difficulties.
Most retail contacts in the First District report a pick-up in sales activity for someperiod during October and the first half of November.  They attribute these improvements, in somecases temporary, to colder weather, early holiday shopping, or increased promotions.  Overall resultsfor the six weeks vary, however, ranging from 10 percent sales declines to gains of 13 percentcompared with a year earlier.  Most respondents detect a rise in consumer confidence and view theeconomy as "OK but not exciting."   They predict 2 to 6 percent sales growth in December; growthwill be restrained because four fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas could cutgains by as much as 3 to 5 percentage points.
Vendor and customer prices remain stable, although one respondent cites continueddeclines in  apparel prices.  Lumber prices have stabilized, following a significant rise and fall earlierthis year.  Retailers have intentionally trimmed inventories compared with a year ago to avoid lastJanuary's overstock.  Most contacts are posting increased profits and gross margins, which theyattribute to better inventory management.  Only one retail chain noted major increases in capitalspending and employment.  Merchants plan to increase wages 2 to 5 percent in 1997.
Most First District manufacturing contacts report continued 5 to 15 percent growthin revenues and/or orders from year-ago levels, and they are at least cautiously optimistic aboutfuture business.  Demand for furniture, appliances, other consumer durables, and medical andcomputer equipment is said to be strong.  Contacts are experiencing moderate to rapid growth inautomotive-related business, but some express concern about a possible slowdown late next year orthereafter.  Aircraft-related orders are picking up significantly, mostly as a result of improvedprofitability of commercial airlines.  The semiconductor industry remains in a slump.   One makerof consumer durables expects to raise production in order to replenish depleted inventories.  Someof the remaining contacts express a desire to reduce inventories as part of an overall cost containmentstrategy.
Materials costs and selling prices remain fairly stable.  A recent drop in componentcosts has led to a larger-than-normal drop in computer prices.  Contacts report slight increases in thecost of selected metals, furniture-grade lumber, and chemical products, but falling costs for paper andpackaging.
Just over half the respondents report fairly stable U.S. employment levels; mostothers have increased employment.  A couple of manufacturers indicate difficulties finding productionworkers, but an equal number indicate ample applicants.  Companywide pay increases range from2.5 to 6 percent.  In the Boston area, compensation packages to attract key technical employees aresaid to be escalating rapidly.
Personnel supply contacts in the First District report solid growth into the fourthquarter of 1996.  The outstanding growth that earlier characterized the industry leveled off for mostfirms in the third quarter:  revenues are now expanding 10 to 20 percent annually, down from 20 to30 percent in 1995 and the first half of 1996.
Industrywide consolidation has increased contacts? reliance on partnerships andsubcontracts with other personnel supply firms.  Vendor-on-premises operations dominate, hurtingsmaller local temp firms and favoring national companies large enough to meet the full range ofemployment demands of clients.
Demand for highly skilled temporary workers continues to outpace supply, especiallyin technical and clerical fields.  Wages have risen 8 to 10 percent over the past year, but this reflectsprimarily an influx of workers from higher-paying sectors rather than expanding wages of individualworkers.  Tightness in the labor market has forced temp agencies to adopt more aggressive recruitingtechniques, including automated resume retrieval, personal networks, and the Internet, as well asenhanced pay and benefit packages.
The residential real estate market in most of New England was stable in the thirdquarter.  Sales volumes have been constant in most states, and contacts report no significant changesin prices.  Contacts in Rhode Island, Vermont, and Maine report that buyers have a large selectionof houses to choose from in all price ranges.  However, no price reductions have been observed sofar.  Low-end houses have been selling better than higher-priced ones.
The market in Massachusetts is doing better.  Sales have gone up throughout thestate, especially in the condominium and new construction markets.  Massachusetts had the highestincrease in existing home sales in the country in both the second and third quarters.  Despite theincrease in activity, inventory grew slightly during the third quarter.  While median sales prices rosemoderately in most of the state, the increases largely reflect a shift in mix as people trade up to moreexpensive homes.
Overall, most contacts predict that the market will remain steady over the next fewmonths.  While low interest rates and a generally positive economic outlook should stimulate sales,activity usually slows in the winter.
Investment management firms report substantial increases in assets under managementsince the beginning of the third quarter of 1996.  Inflows into stock funds were high in Septemberand slowed somewhat in October.  Bond funds experienced inflows in September but were in netliquidation in October.  Most respondents increased employment in the third quarter.  Salary increasesare reported to be about 5 percent, the same as last year.
