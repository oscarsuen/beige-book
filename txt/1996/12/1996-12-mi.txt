As winter sets in, the Ninth Districtcontinues to enjoy moderate economicgrowth with few problem areas. Unemployment remains low, andindications of very tight labor markets arewidespread.  In spite of reports of  labormarket tightness and of some wageincreases, there are few reports of priceincreases for raw materials, consumergoods or services. Construction is brisk inmany areas.  Iron mining and oil drilling arevery strong and paper production displayssome signs of recovery from the slumpexperienced over the last year.  Retail salesof general merchandise apparently arepicking up, and increased strength in vehiclesales continues. The 1996 crop wasexcellent in most respects, the profitabilityof livestock production has recoveredsomewhat, and farmers reportedly areincreasing their spending on household andcapital items.  Manufacturing showsmoderate growth.  Tourism is the weakestsector,  continuing a pattern set earlier in1996.
"Stores shop for workers," headlined a SouthDakota news article describing the extraefforts retailers are making to secureneeded seasonal workers in an extremelytight labor market.  Labor scarcity continuesas the most-cited problem confrontingbusinesses in the district.  Reports ofincreases in pay or benefits to attractentry-level workers or skilled technicalspecialists remain frequent, but manyemployers say there is no generalizedupward pressure on compensation.                                    Notwithstanding reports of compensationincreases for entry-level and certainspecialist employees, there are few reportsof increases in the prices for goods andservices.  Petroleum products are oneexception.  Increased fuel prices are cited asa major cost increase for trucking firms anda Minnesota-based airline.  One Minnesotachemical product manufacturer citesincreases in the cost of all chemicals derivedfrom petroleum or natural gas or whoseproduction is energy intensive.  At theconsumer level, milk prices increasedsharply from late September into November,but farm level milk prices were fallingsharply in late November, and retail pricesare expected to follow shortly.
"There are quite a few new motels going upin Sioux Falls."  "The 'nuclear winter' is overin downtown St. Paul commercial realestate market."  "Construction in westernWisconsin has been at record levels for sixmonths."  "Twin Cities building permits up15 percent from a year ago."  Reports such asthis are widespread, revealing aconstruction and real estate sector that still has stamina after four years of expansion. The strength is broad-based acrossresidential, commercial, light industrial andpublic infrastructure projects.  Regionally,there are some reports of a slowing pace ofresidential construction in westernMontana and eastern North Dakota, areasthat had been strong for three years.Realtors in Minneapolis-St. Paul report goodbusiness for both residential andcommercial property.
Iron ore mining and oil drilling continue atthe brisk pace that has prevailed for severalmonths, and industry spokespersons expectthat pace to continue into 1997.  An advisorycouncil member from Michigan's UpperPeninsula describes increased production ata paper mill in his area.  Other paperindustry contacts also describe someexpansion of output, but production has notreturned to the high levels experienced twoyears ago.  Building board producers in theeastern portion of the district continueproducing near capacity.
One exception to this pattern of strongactivity in natural resources industries istraditional sawmills in western SouthDakota and Montana, where outputreportedly is stagnant or declining, largelydue to reduced federal timber sales. Environmental concerns have blocked thepartial reopening of a Michigan copper mineclosed last year.
"Sales are really pretty good, a bit slow in thesummer, but getting better steadily in thefall," says one Minnesota electronicsmanufacturer.  "We are seeing a lot of smallfactories coming in, mostly metalfabrication," says a utility manager fromMichigan's Upper Peninsula.  On the whole,manufacturing in the Ninth District appearshealthy, with good orders and growingoutput, but with few bottlenecks or inputshortages.  Contacts report generally normalinventories and no  delays or difficulties insecuring raw materials.
"Prices are somewhat better than we hadexpected," comments a South Dakotarancher who believes that the price trough ofthe beef cycle was passed last spring and thatboth fat and feeder cattle prices will trendupward in 1997.  Higher prices for feedercattle are due in part to lower feed costs asfavorable grain yields have put downwardpressure on prices.  Grain producersgenerally have completed harvesting in mostareas, and yields were excellent and betterthan had been expected through the growingseason.  Winter wheat seeded in SouthDakota and Montana is generally in goodcondition.  But the late harvest and earlyonset of very cold weather prevented muchfall tillage, and farmers in Wisconsin,Minnesota and South Dakota will have torush to catch up next spring.  Overallproduction of sugar beets and potatoes inNorth Dakota and northwest Minnesota wasalso good.
There are some indications that consumerspending has increased in late fall and earlywinter.  Vehicle sales are described as goodin many areas, with sales of pickup trucksreportedly very robust in North Dakota,South Dakota and much of Minnesota.  A large national retailer based in Minnesotareported improved earnings for the thirdquarter compared to somewhat sluggishperformance earlier in 1996.  A regionaldepartment store chain also describesimproved sales in October and November. Reports from advisory council membersaround the district indicate generaloptimism among retailers in regard to theholiday season.  Some sources indicatesluggish sales of major                         appliances, but say that sales of apparel andconsumer electronics are stronger than inthe first two quarters.
"Tourism has been down 11 percent thisyear," reports a motel owner from RapidCity, S.D.  He is echoed by sources in otherregions, who sketch a general pattern oflackluster tourist and recreation businesscontinuing through the year.  WesternWisconsin, where tourism has grown tomatch that of better-known scenic areas ofthe state, is one exception.  The pheasanthunting season in South Dakota was abouteven with 1995.  Early snow in northernareas has been encouraging to businessesserving cross-country skiers andsnowmobilers.
