Most District contacts continue toreport growth at their firms and in theirindustries.

Bankers across the District reportcontinued strength in loan demand,especially on the commercial side.  Credit isdescribed as plentiful by most Districtcontacts.

With the fall harvest winding down,substantial rainfall during early- to mid-November in several parts of the Districtslowed the pace of activity to a nearstandstill.
