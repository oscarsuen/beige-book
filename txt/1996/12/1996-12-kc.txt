The district economy continued to grow moderately during thepast month.  Retail sales increased, manufacturing and construction activity remainedfairly strong, and energy activity improved somewhat.  In the farm economy, an excellentharvest has brightened income prospects for crop producers, and higher cattle prices haverestored profits to cattle feeders.  Labor markets remained tight in much of the district,prompting a number of firms to increase wages.  Prices rose for some materials used inmanufacturing and construction.  At the retail level, prices generally held steady.
Retailers report sales increased last month and weremoderately higher than a year ago.  Sales of apparel and electronics were brisk.  Mostretailers expect a strong Christmas season even though the late Thanksgiving may hurtsales somewhat.  Retailers were generally satisfied with their inventory levels.  Automobile dealers report sales were unchanged last month and expect sales to increasesomewhat the rest of the year.  Dealers have been expanding inventories, and some stilldo not have as many light trucks and sport utility vehicles as they would like.
Manufacturers continued to operate last month atmoderately high levels of capacity.  Manufacturing materials were generally available,with lead times either holding steady or declining.  Most manufacturers were satisfiedwith their inventory levels.  A quarterly survey of district manufacturers indicated thatproduction, shipments, and new orders all increased modestly from September to October.
Builders report housing startsslowed last month yet remained higher thana year ago.  Starts of both single-familyhomes and multifamily units declined.  Builders expect little change in constructionactivity, except for the normal seasonalslowdown toward the end of the year.  Salesof new homes also fell last month.  Mostbuilding materials were readily available,and delivery times were normal.  Mortgagelenders report slightly higher demand lastmonth and expect little change the rest of theyear.
Bankers report that loansremained unchanged and deposits edged uplast month, slightly reducing loan-to-depositratios.   Home mortgage loans, home equityloans, and commercial real estate loansedged up, while residential constructionloans fell slightly.   Demand deposits, NOWaccounts, and money market depositaccounts all rose slightly, outweighing declines in large CDs and small time andsavings deposits.
All respondent banks held theirprime lending rates steady last month andexpect to leave rates unchanged in the nearterm.  Banks also held their consumerlending rates steady and plan no changes inthe near future.  A greater fraction of banksthan in past months tightened their lendingstandards.
District energy activityimproved somewhat last month, helped byhigher prices for oil and natural gas.  Thedistrict rig count rose 2.4 percent in Octoberand was above its year-ago level.
District farmers are justcompleting an excellent fall harvest,including the largest district corn crop in adecade.  The newly planted winter wheatcrop is in very good condition and shouldprovide plenty of wheat pasture for cattle, insharp contrast with a year ago when therewas virtually none.  Prices for fed cattlehave jumped well above breakeven levelsrecently due to a seasonal decline in beefsupplies.  The higher prices brought a hugeinflow of cattle into district feedlots duringthe past two months.  Many industry analysts expectprices to soften when the cattle now infeedlots are slaughtered early next year.  Incontrast to cattle feeders,  ranchers werestill posting losses and continued to reducethe size of their herds.
The bumper harvest and record grainprices earlier in the year have improved theoverall quality of farm loan portfolios atdistrict banks.  The quality of some cattleloans has declined somewhat after sizablelosses in the cattle industry.  Most cattleproducers still have strong balance sheets,however, and an uptick in the demand forfeeder cattle loans suggests producers aregearing up to take advantage of the recentincrease in cattle prices.
Labor markets were stilltight last month, and there was somecontinued evidence of wage pressures. Manufacturers report skilled and unskilledworkers remained in short supply, and anumber of companies say they haveresponded by increasing wages.  Prices heldsteady at the retail level and rose for somemanufacturing and construction materials. Retailers expect no major price changes incoming months.
