Reports from Beige Book contactsportray a moderate pace of economicgrowth in most Twelfth District states inrecent months, with an expectation ofpicking up to a faster underlying growthtrend.  Retailers generally reportedmoderate growth in overall sales throughOctober and an intended inventory build-upthat reflects expectations of a strongholiday sales season.  Producers ofservices noted further growth of demand,and reports on District manufacturingproduction and orders generally werefavorable.  Residential real estate marketactivity reportedly was strong in mostDistrict states, with relatively high levelsof residential construction continuing inthe fastest-growing states.
District respondents generallyexpect continued favorable nationaleconomic performance, with regionaleconomic growth outpacing the nationalrate.  Most respondents expect U.S. realGDP growth next year to continue at aboutthe long-run average pace of around 2percent, leaving the nationalunemployment rate near the currentrelatively low level.  Inflation is expectedto pick up only slightly.  More than three-quartersof respondents expect their localeconomies to do better than the nation.This optimism is apparent in Californiaand in the fast-growing states of theIntermountain area and the PacificNorthwest.
Most Districtstates reported moderate growth in overallretail sales in recent months.  In manycases inventories have been built up inanticipation of a strongChristmas selling season, and currentstocks generally were reported to be undercontrol.  The sanguine view of currentinventory levels also was held by motorvehicle dealers, even though October trucksales reportedly dropped back, and autosales remained flat.
Among respondents from service-producing industries, providers oftelecommunications services continue toreport a strong pickup in demand.Demand for other utility services isincreasing.  Tourism activity in theDistrict also continued to be strong.  Hoteloccupancy rates reportedly increased inseveral areas, including Utah, where theski business is benefitting from an earlysnowfall.
Reports on District manufacturingactivity generally were favorable.  Thepositive spillovers from the ramp-up inproduction of commercial aircraft atBoeing reportedly are extending to theaircraft parts industry and fuelingdemand for some types of primary andfabricated metals, electrical machinery,and components.  However, except fortitanium, material supplies have not been aproblem thus far; other metal productssuch as aluminum appear to be inabundant supply.  Lumber producers inthe Pacific Northwest reported a recentpickup in demand for their products,owing both to increased building activityand increased market share, given reducedCanadian supply.  Demand for pulp andpaper products also reportedlyimproved recently.  Elsewhere, in themachine tool industry, slowing domesticorders are being offset by a slight pickup inforeign orders.
District agricultural conditionswere good through the fall.  In the PacificNorthwest, bountiful harvests of mostcrops were reported.  California?s CentralValley vegetable growers were able toproduce enough to take advantage of highprices, which have been elevated by shortcrops elsewhere in the nation.  Cottonyields in California also generally werehigh, with the exception of some southernareas that experienced hot weather.  Alarge drop in feedgrain prices increasedthe demand for feeder cattle.
Residential real estate marketactivity reportedly was strong in mostDistrict states, although activity slowed insome of the strongest markets and pickedup in other areas.  Respondents from theIntermountain states of Arizona, Idaho,and Utah reported that the recent rapidpace of sales and of price gains for existinghomes was not sustained in recent months.Within California, notable increases inhome prices generally were confined to theSan Francisco Bay Area.  In contrast,housing sales and prices reportedly pickedup in Washington and Oregon, owing tostrengthening economic conditions,population inflows, and increasinglybinding constraints on the availability ofurban land.
Relatively high levels of residentialconstruction appear to have continued inthe fast-growing states where home priceshave been appreciating rapidly, but homebuilding remained weak in California.  Inthe fast-growing Intermountain andPacific Northwest states, non-residentialconstruction also was reported at highlevels this fall.  The overall strength indemand for construction labor in suchareas is exerting significant pressure onwages, given also the tightness in thebroader labor market.
District financial institutionsgenerally report continued favorableconditions.  Loan demand increased inmost areas, including Southern California,where overall economic conditions havebeen weaker than elsewhere.  However,even in the fastest-growing areas, banksreport some concern about deterioratingconsumer credit quality, as measured byincreasing delinquencies andbankruptcies.
