The Eleventh District expansion moderated in late June and July after strong growth noted in previous surveys. Most respondents expect business conditions to remain at good levels for the rest of the year. Manufacturing orders were softer, as construction-related orders slowed slightly and semiconductor orders remained weak. Increased drilling activity boosted orders for energy-related equipment. Retailers reported slower sales and noted reduced traffic at stores. Loan demand was mixed, as refinancings continued falling, new residential loans held steady, and loans for commercial construction and consumers picked up. Although construction activity held steady over the past six weeks, contacts in the residential sector expected slower housing construction in coming months. Nonetheless, contacts said higher demand for office space reduced vacancies, especially in suburban markets. Record heat and drought continued to impede agricultural production.
