Cattle feedlots and ranches continue to operate at a loss, due to high feed costs and weak cattle prices. Agricultural bankers report that district feedlots have cut production, with many operating at only half to three-fourths of capacity. In addition, ranchers have trimmed herds by selling older, less productive cows. Overall, little improvement is expected in district farm income this year, as continued financial losses in the cattle industry largely offset financial gains by crop producers.
