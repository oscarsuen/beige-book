Potentially good harvests are being reported for a variety of fruits, including strawberries, cherries, and tomatoes in Ohio, and peaches in West Virginia. In Kentucky, apples are reportedly in good condition.
Capital goods firms are still producing at a high level, and suppliers to the light vehicles industry report a sharp increase in production between the first and second quarters. Several sources note that lean inventories and recently raised production schedules in light vehicle manufacturing are responsible for the increased production at auto suppliers. Heavy truck manufacturers, which cut production earlier in the year, have noted a leveling off this summer. Elsewhere, demand for machine tools and electronic machinery are both reported to be good, especially in areas related to housing, such as electrical components and light construction machinery. Off-highway machinery and industrial controls are noted to be flat, however.
Cost increases are said to be modest. Reports from area purchasing managers indicate price hikes for a variety of chemicals and agricultural commodities, but price declines are noted for a broad range of metals, wood products, and fuels. Although a few firms indicate increased difficulty in attracting and retaining workers, wage growth is reported to be between 2 percent and 4 percent, similar to earlier in the year.
Non-auto retail inventories are reported to be adequate, and prices are holding steady or declining slightly.
Although auto sales were essentially flat in the region during June and July, year-to-date receipts remain above last year's levels. The slip in early-summer sales has been attributed to lack of product. Indeed, many dealers report that they had adequate buyer interest, but were unable to provide desired options and equipment. In general, dealers remain very optimistic about the upcoming months.
