Multifamily homebuilding and commercial construction continue to improve in most areas. Low vacancy rates and rising rents continue to support new industrial and office development, although the pace of retail construction has moderated. While most commercial projects continue to be build-to-suit, several speculative developments are underway, and more are expected to be announced in the next six months. Most real estate agents anticipate moderate-to-strong growth in commercial and multifamily construction through the end of the year.
