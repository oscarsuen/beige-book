Firms in the major business sectors of the Third District gave varied reports on activity for July. Most of the manufacturers surveyed noted increases in shipments and orders; however, producers of building products and industrial equipment were experiencing slower business. Most of the retailers contacted said sales were healthy but the year-over-year gains in June and July were below those achieved in the early spring; some merchants even noted slight declines. Auto dealers generally said sales have been steady. Most of the bankers polled for this report 3said loan volumes outstanding were flat, and they continued to describe competition for commercial lending as strong. Some also said that, while consumer loans remained level, delinquencies were on the rise. Recent comments from employment agencies in the Philadelphia area indicated that demand for clerical workers remained healthy and that there has been some increase in the demand for manufacturing workers.
Area manufacturers extended working hours slightly and hired more workers in July, and they are planning some further increases in staffing levels during the second half of the year. While the balance of opinion among area manufacturers is that business will continue to improve during the third and fourth quarters, several noted that both domestic and foreign competition appears to be keeping prices in check.
Auto dealers reported that sales were running at a steady pace, modestly above the rate for last summer. Light truck sales were up more than car sales on a year-over-year basis. Most dealers expect sales to continue at the current rate, although some are apprehensive that growing consumer debt burdens could lead to a downturn later in the year.
In several instances, according to both temporary employment agencies and contractors, the back-office staffs that these firms eliminated have become employees of the agencies and contractors supplying services to these firms, but many of the former employees have taken some reductions in pay and benefits.
