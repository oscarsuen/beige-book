Most sectors of the Second District's economy improved in recent weeks. Both the commercial and residential real estate markets continue to strengthen-vacancy rates are down, construction of multi-family units has surged, and sales of both new and existing single-family homes are up. Regional purchasing managers report continued growth in the manufacturing sector in July. The boom in tourism continues, with New York City hotels approaching full occupancy. On a weaker note, retail sales, which had been fairly brisk in May, slowed in June and July, and were generally below plan; also, banks reported a slight rebound in delinquency rates in July. Wage and price pressures generally remain subdued, except in Manhattan's tight real estate market, where rents on apartments and hotel-room rates have risen sharply.
All of the retailers surveyed reported that inventories were on or close to target as of late July. With retailers now starting to build inventories for the fall season, most say they are "cautious" in their expectations for the second half of the year. Virtually all contacts report that their effective selling prices are steady, that merchandise costs are flat to declining, and that there are no wage pressures.
The District's residential real estate markets were generally strong in June, led by the multifamily sector. Manhattan's housing shortage and double-digit rent increases continue to make headlines, while prices for co-ops and condominiums have reportedly risen more modestly. In New York State, building permits for multi-family structures surged in both the first and second quarters, and are running at more than double last year's level. Virtually all the gains were concentrated in New York City and its northern and eastern suburbs.
Realtors in the district also report fairly brisk demand for existing single-family homes. In New York State, second-quarter sales surged 16 percent from a year earlier, though gains were more moderate in June. While second-quarter data are not yet available for New Jersey, most realtors report that the market is strong, fueled by first-time buyers. Home prices are rising at about a 4 percent annual rate in both states. The market for new single-family homes is mixed. New York State homebuilders report steady improvement-down-state New York remains strong, while upstate markets are beginning to snap out of their chronic slump. In New Jersey, however, builders report that the housing market remains "in the doldrums"--traffic is mediocre, there is no sense of urgency to buy, and affordability remains a problem.
Banks reported modest increases in loan delinquencies in all lending categories. Loan officers are generally more willing to lend than two months ago, and nearly all have maintained the same credit standards. Average loan rates continued to rise-they are higher or unchanged at almost all of the participating banks. The spread between the average lending and deposit rates is steady at nearly 60 percent of the banks and narrower at close to 30 percent.
