Unemployment is still remarkably low in most parts of the District, but there is little evidence wage growth is rising. Wage gains for existing employees reportedly remain in the 2% to 3% range. A few firms, however, note that the cost of new hires is accelerating, creating concern that these wage increases may spill into existing labor agreements.
In Kentucky, the soybean crop is considered "promising," with a solid 18% rated as excellent. Also, the recent hot and dry weather has been beneficial to the state's tobacco crop. Corn development in Pennsylvania is near normal for the season.
Employment conditions in manufacturing are holding firm. Hours have come down a bit from earlier in the year, and hiring rates are considered about average. While skilled labor shortages are still reported to be a problem, the situation does not seem to have worsened much in the past few months. Cost pressures are also said to be relatively light. Cold-rolled and scrap steel prices have risen, as have a variety of chemical prices, but downward price adjustments are noted for paper and wood products.
General retail inventories are in good condition and prices remain steady. Competition for qualified workers remains a problem for most retailers and hiring difficulties are noted.
District auto sales slowed somewhat in July and August, although year-to-date sales are still relatively strong. Most dealers attributed the recent downturn to lean inventories and slack fleet activity. While a few dealers see waning consumer demand as a contributing factor, dealer optimism over the new model year is high.
A number of District bankers continue to see a deterioration in household balance sheets. Still, while loan quality has fallen and delinquencies continue to rise, most bankers report relatively healthy credit markets.
