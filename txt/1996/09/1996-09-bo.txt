The First District economy continues to expand as the summer draws to a close. Manufacturers and personnel supply firms report solid growth. Most retail contacts indicate that sales were better than expected in August. Investment management firms are growing modestly. Residential real estate markets in much of New England are in good shape. With exceptions, input and selling prices are said to be stable while wages and salaries are up 2 to 4 percent.
Vendor and customer prices remain stable; by exception, the retail price of leather has risen 5 to 10 percent and the cost of lumber continues to move up. Contacts note that offering fewer sales promotions has generally improved gross margins; profits, however, are mixed for the first half of the year. Capital spending increases this year are limited primarily to improvements in technology. Only one respondent cites a major reduction in employment; most others have level job counts and anticipate wage increases of 2 to 4 percent for the year.
On the whole, inventories are reported to be roughly in line with company targets. However, a contact in the paper industry is curtailing production in order to eliminate excess inventories. A producer of industrial machinery intends to add to inventories, while a metals fabricator reports being unable to do so because the company is operating at full capacity.
Manufacturers report that selling and input prices generally are little changed from a year ago. By exception, the price of memory chips has fallen by half in the last few months. Thus far, this development has not led to an intensification of the downward trend in computer prices, however. Paper prices have recovered a bit from their recent lows but remain far below year-ago levels. Plastics prices have subsided after rising earlier this year, while some metals prices continue to increase a little.
Most manufacturing contacts indicate that their U.S. employment is flat to slightly higher than a year ago. Wages and salaries have increased 2 1/2 to 4 percent, with the lower end of this range reflecting contracts negotiated in previous years. Businesses recruiting computer specialists or engineers indicate that they must offer attractive salaries and profit-sharing or discounted stock plans. Nevertheless, contacts report that they are able to hire the employees they need even in such sought-after professions.
Manufacturers typically are continuing to spend the same amount on capital as last year. Such spending represents sizable increases in capacity for about one-third of the contacts.
Inventory levels are reported to be adequate in most parts of the region except Massachusetts, where one contact suggests that low inventories could lead to diminished sales in the rest of the year. New construction remains solid overall, and credit for consumers and builders is reported to be readily available. Contacts note signs of decline in real-estate-related employment in southern New England, with consolidation reported among brokers in Rhode Island and appraisers in Connecticut.
