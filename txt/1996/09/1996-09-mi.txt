As the summer has progressed, the Ninth District continues to experience favorable economic conditions in most sectors. All types of construction are strong. Crop conditions are good, though delayed development may expose corn and soybeans to frost damage. Farmers are responding to high grain prices and favorable crop expectations by increasing capital spending. Oil, gas, iron and nonferrous mining output continues strong. Manufacturing is generally robust, and inventories are described as normal. Vehicle sales continue moderate to strong, while other retailers report good sales. Tourism is somewhat slow, especially in western areas. Despite some indications of wage pressure, most compensation increases appear modest. Commodity prices have fallen, and intermediate and final goods prices are largely stable.
All types of construction are brisk. Single-family permits in Minnesota are running 4 percent above year-earlier and two year-earlier levels. Housing construction is also brisk in west central Wisconsin, eastern North Dakota and some Montana cities. A very low 4.3 percent vacancy rate for industrial property in Minneapolis-St. Paul has boosted light industrial building. And publicly let bids for highway and heavy construction in Minnesota and the Dakotas are 13 percent above 1995 for the year through July, the fourth consecutive year of strong increases.
"July and August have been very good for us," comments an officer of a large Minnesota realty company. Strong sales of existing housing are making headlines in Minneapolis-St. Paul, and reportedly are also strong in the Eau Claire, Wis., area. Commercial rentals in the same area also are described as good.
Lumber and oriented-strand board production is somewhat above summer 1995 levels. Paper prices have stabilized and sales of some types are reportedly good. Overall output, however, remains down from a year ago.
Cattle and hog slaughter prices are slightly higher than in early summer, with cattle slaughter numbers somewhat ahead of year-ago levels. Market sources report that cows as a percentage of total slaughter is about 4 percentage points higher than last year, an indication that herd liquidations are taking place. Hog slaughter numbers, weights and percent sows show little change from summer 1995 levels. Milk prices are at new nominal highs, and some 20 percent above year-earlier levels. Production continues down and industry officials expect it to remain low in response to high feed costs.
Farm spending is reportedly on the increase in many crop areas, particularly for machinery. "It's been an exceptional year," says a Grand Forks, N. D., implement dealer. Overall, dealers in that state are having the strongest sales in five years and their counterparts in Minnesota and eastern South Dakota also report brisk business.
"Retail sales seem to be a little bit above our projections," reports a South Dakota revenue official. "Traffic in our stores is excellent," according to a Fargo, N.D., mall manager. On balance, retail sales seem moderate to strong, with consumers reportedly very selective and value-oriented in their purchases. Retailers complain that stiff competition stemming from recent growth in retail capacity is cutting into margins. "We have to advertise much more than two years ago to keep same-store sales marginally above what we were selling then," says a spokesperson of one Minnesota-based electronics and appliance retailer.
