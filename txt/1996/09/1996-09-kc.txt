One respondent bank increased its prime rate last month. None of the other banks expect to change their prime rate soon. Most of the respondents held their consumer lending rates steady and plan to keep them unchanged in the near term. Almost a third of the respondent banks tightened their lending standards last month.
Income prospects for district livestock producers are not so bright. Cattle feeders have returned to thin profits recently, while ranchers continue to post substantial losses. In response to ongoing losses, many district ranchers have trimmed their herds significantly this summer. Industry participants report contraction in the cattle numbers could end this fall due to improved pasture conditions, ample hay supplies, and expectations that corn prices will drop as the harvest gets under way. Having sustained losses earlier in the year, most cattle feedlots in the district operated well below capacity during the past month. The cutback in cattle on feed has reduced beef supplies enough to push prices slightly above break-even levels. Nevertheless, many bankers expect a heavy inflow of calves into district feedlots this fall, which could renew downward pressure on cattle prices and erode profit margins.
District bankers report stronger crop loan portfolios and weaker livestock loan portfolios than a year ago. Bankers in wheat-growing areas in the district report that high wheat prices have generally offset a disappointing wheat harvest, leaving the quality of loan portfolios unchanged. Bankers in areas growing corn and soybeans expect their loan quality to improve this year. In contrast, bankers report some continued erosion in the quality of ranching loans.
