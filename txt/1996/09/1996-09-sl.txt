Some import dealers report a shortage of product. Most contacts report a lower-than-usual stock of 1996 models as they begin the new model year.

A St. Louis-based food processing company sold off its cereal division, eliminating about 150 jobs from its headquarters. The strike that is affecting McDonnell Douglas remains unsettled. For the most part, the effects on the local economy appear to be isolated.
