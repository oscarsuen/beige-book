Economic conditions in most sectors of the Second District continued to improve since the last report. Most retailers report that sales rebounded in August and were running on or ahead of plan. Real estate markets strengthened across the board, with demand for both single- and multi-family homes firming throughout the region and New York City's office market tightening further. Purchasing managers in the region report ongoing improvement in the manufacturing sector in August. Private-sector job growth accelerated in July, but public-sector employment fell sharply, mostly due to reductions in the federal summer jobs program. There are no signs of increased price or wage pressures, aside from some firming in real estate values. Finally, banks report a slight softening in demand for commercial and industrial loans.
Retailers report that price and wage pressures remain subdued. Selling prices are said to be flat to slightly higher, while merchandise costs are steady to slightly lower. All contacts report that there is no noticeable wage pressure; most anticipate a modest impact, if any, from the upcoming minimum wage hike.
The District's residential real estate markets continued to improve in July and August. Homebuilders in New Jersey report that both traffic and sales have picked up in recent weeks, after a sluggish second quarter. Builders in New York report a continued pickup in activity across most of the state, with only the Syracuse and Binghamton areas lagging. Strong demand and thin inventories are reportedly spurring more speculative building activity, mostly in downstate New York (notably Long Island). In general, demand continues to be strongest at the lower end of the market.
Similarly, realtors in both states report strong sales of existing homes, along with moderate price appreciation. New York State realtors report that July home sales were up 18 percent from a year ago, while prices were up 8 percent. In New Jersey, second-quarter sales climbed 13 percent from a year earlier, to their highest level in nearly a decade, with prices up 5 percent. Similarly, Manhattan's co-op and condominium market has been buoyed by rapidly rising rents. One large real estate broker reports that demand for studio and one-bedroom apartments, which had languished for years, has picked up dramatically in recent months, with some buyers bidding above the asking price.
Average loan rates were steady to slightly lower in all categories, after rising in the prior survey, while deposit rates were generally higher. Loan delinquency rates, which had risen moderately in July, held steady for consumer loans and declined for commercial loans in August.
