Staffing services firms reported further strengthening in demand for temporary and permanent employees, with a continuing trend towards conversion of temporary employees to permanent status. August is a normally a busy month in the temporary help industry, and it was especially busy this year. These companies generally expect their business to continue to strengthen over the balance of 1994 on a seasonally adjusted basis. Most of these firms reported that the supply of better-qualified labor has grown increasingly scarce, and wages offered temporary workers are rising. One firm has noted higher wages offered in its competitors' help-wanted advertising. A number of staffing firms reported higher recruiting costs (as did a large distribution services company). Some temporary help firms noted that increased competition has restricted (but not eliminated) the ability to pass on higher wages in the prices charged to their client companies. Wages paid in permanent positions at their client companies do not yet seem to be under the same upward pressure for a similar temporary position, according to one temporary help firm, but "we think we see it before they do." Two firms separately reported that the wages paid to their temporary employees have increased roughly 5 to 10 percent, on average, during 1994.
