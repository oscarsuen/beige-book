Economic activity continued to expand through the summer, according to reports from businesses in most Federal Reserve Districts. Regions that have been lagging are generally said to be doing better while most of the stronger areas saw growth plateau. The expansion in consumer spending is seen as healthy, albeit decelerating, and retailers' expectations for holiday sales are generally favorable. Summer tourism activity has generally been strong, outpacing last year's levels. Most manufacturers around the country continued to report at least moderate strength. Single-family home sales were seen as slowing modestly in most Districts, with home construction easing in some areas. At the same time, commercial real estate conditions were generally described as improved. Overall bank loan demand appears to be modestly increasing, but higher interest rates are reported to be slowing real estate lending in most areas. There are more reports of tightening labor markets than before, though wage pressures are still described as modest. Industrial materials prices edged up further, but businesses say that competitive pressures continue to restrain price increases on finished goods. Farm contacts report that crop conditions in most agricultural areas are favorable and point toward an excellent fall harvest.
Automobile dealers in most Districts report that demand is strong, but those in Chicago, Kansas City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis say that a limited supply of autos on the lot is restricting sales. Dallas dealers report that although sales have slowed they are still above year-ago levels. The Kansas City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis Districts expect sales to remain healthy as long as inventories hold out.
A number of manufacturers of heavy equipment and building materials have announced capacity expansion projects in the Chicago District. In the Kansas City region, manufacturers purchasing construction materials, such as cement and lumber, are facing longer delivery times. Dallas reports that the demand for chemicals is outstripping available capacity. Although overall manufacturers' shipments and new orders have evidently slowed in the Richmond District, exports have increased.
Less positively, some industrial sectors have shown little improvement. One aerospace supplier in the San Francisco District reports that its backlogs have increased in the past year, but they remain well below levels seen two years ago. Atlanta says that regional military contractors see orders declining and are concerned about future prospects. Manufacturing increased at a sluggish pace in Richmond and factory orders decelerated slightly in the Dallas region. Boston and Atlanta manufacturers indicate that orders for some types of apparel and textiles remain weak.
On the whole, service firms saw increased demand in most Districts. Dallas reports that demand for business services accelerated there, with temporary staffing and trucking firms noting the strongest gains.
Nationally, commercial real estate agents report improving conditions. However, realtors in the downtown areas of Dallas and Boston note that markets in those cities remain particularly weak while the surrounding suburbs are improving. Construction of retail stores is dominating the markets in the Atlanta, Dallas, and Richmond Districts. Multifamily occupancy rates and rental rates have been on the rise throughout the Atlanta and Dallas Districts.
