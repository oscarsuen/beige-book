District car dealers report robust year-over-year sales growth of 7 percent to 10 percent. Shortages of many models, especially trucks, restricted sales growth to some extent. The use of rebates and other incentives to move inventory has declined dramatically. Expectations are that strong sales will continue as long as inventories can keep up with demand.
Firms also report sales growth. A contact in the heating and cooling industry reports the industry is having its best year ever, with production up 15 percent over last year. Sales of air conditioning units are up about 600,000 units over last year. A manufacturer of oil filtration and reclamation equipment reports that business has rebounded in the third quarter after a sluggish start earlier in the year, as contracts from South America and Pacific Rim countries, in particular, have increased.
Some industries noted a slowing. A contact in the farm equipment industry reports that sales are down 16 percent from one year ago. A maker of rubber compounds reports slowing because of reduced orders from auto makers. A garment manufacturer will close its west central Arkansas plant because of increased global competition.
