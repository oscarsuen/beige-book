Commercial and multifamily real estate contacts continue to report improving conditions in their markets. Multifamily occupancy rates continue to rise and rental rates have also been on the increase. New apartment and condominium developments have been announced recently in many parts of the District. Commercial realtors continue to report tightening markets characterized by falling vacancy rates and rising rental prices, though commercial construction is reported to continue at low levels, except in the retail sector which is seeing moderate gains, and the Atlanta metro area, in which there is some new building in preparation for the 1996 Olympics.
