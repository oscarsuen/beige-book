Price increases in the industrial sector are apparently sticking, among them a sharp rise in industrial chemicals prices. A number of District sources are also reporting a further upward movement in metals prices--steel prices are up about $10 per ton in the past month or so. Domestic capacity problems in the steel industry are evidently propping up foreign steel production as well, with imports reported to be 80% above last year's level.
A major food processor also notes improving business conditions, with both domestic and foreign sales volume on the rise. Abundant harvests are keeping foodstuff price increases moderate, however, up about 1% to 2% on average from last year.
The rise in retail inventories during the second quarter was generally small relative to sales. In fact, several large retail chains saw the higher inventories as a welcome development in light of their increasingly short-stocked situation, and one retailer characterized the inventory turnover rate as "very good."
Auto sales are much improved as dealer inventories are refreshed by the model-year changeover. Most vehicle types are selling well, even imports, but light truck sales are especially strong. Dealer inventory shortages are not as prevalent as they were during the summer, although some models remain scarce.
Competitive pressures at the retail level are severe, and price increases here are still modest. Consequently, retail margins remain lean.
