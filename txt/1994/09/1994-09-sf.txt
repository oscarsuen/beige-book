Tourism remains strong in most of the District. Car rental agencies in Salt Lake City rented their entire inventory for each of the first three weeks of August. In California, tourism has been strong, reportedly buoyed by an influx of foreign tourists who are taking advantage of the continuing weakness of the dollar.
Maritime industry business is stable. Some weakness in employment is reported in other service-providing industries; a California telecommunications utility reports further downsizing of employment, as rapid technological advances permit investment in better equipment at lower prices.
More broadly, labor demand appears to be accelerating a bit in the District, as indicated by reported increases in help-wanted advertising at newspapers. Outside of California, some labor markets show signs of tightness. An Oregon bank reports increased difficulty filling part-time positions. A multi-state construction firm reports that the shortage of skilled construction workers is worsening. A Utah retailer reports unusual increases in wages for entry-level jobs.
Uncertainties created by domestic mining law reform are reported to be driving some mining exploration activity overseas. In Nevada, several mining exploration offices have closed.
Construction activity generally remains strong outside California. In Seattle, commercial occupancy rates are increasing, and there is a growing shortage of light industrial facilities. In southwestern Utah, Idaho, eastern Oregon, and eastern Washington, residential construction has remained particularly strong. Single-family home construction is reported to have slowed recently in a few areas, particularly Portland and Salt Lake City. In California, both residential and commercial construction activity remain low. In Southern California, rents for commercial real estate still are weak, but occupancy rates have improved somewhat.
