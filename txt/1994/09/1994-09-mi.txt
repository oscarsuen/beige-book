The Ninth District economy remains robust. Construction and manufacturing are strong. Metal mining shipments are growing and oil and gas drilling is above 1993 levels. Output of forest products for construction remains high, and beleaguered paper mills are benefiting from price increases for some products. Crop and livestock production is above year-earlier levels. Vehicle sales continue to be very good, but general merchandise retailers may have reached a plateau. The summer tourist season has been excellent.
Employment levels continue higher than year-earlier levels in all parts of the district and unemployment rates are lower. Some firms report difficulty in finding skilled employees, particularly in metropolitan areas. But there is little upward pressure on wages or prices except for petroleum products and newsprint.
Manufacturing continues to grow. News media and district directors report good manufacturing sales, particularly by machining and metal fabricating businesses and by producers of construction-related products. Producers of farm implements and industrial machinery also reportedly have good business.
Prospects are good in the metal mining sector. One Minnesota iron mine, idled for a year after a labor dispute, is back in full production and other mines report strong shipments. A Minnesota industry spokesperson said, "We expect a 43 million ton year in 1995," roughly 6 percent above 1994 shipments. Oil production continues to erode in North Dakota and Montana, but drilling activity through mid-summer is generally above 1993, reportedly in response to higher oil prices. A Montana official noted that a new law lowering taxes for horizontally-drilled oil wells had caused a spurt of drilling.
The numbers of livestock on farms and slaughtered remain high compared to year-earlier levels and longer term average levels. Cattle prices have recovered slightly from lows set in July, but hog prices have been essentially steady since June. Given the production cycles for cattle and hogs, output can be expected to remain high through the remainder of 1994. Minnesota and Wisconsin milk production in July was slightly below 1993 levels.
But any impetus to farmers' personal or business spending as a result of increased production may be limited by widespread declines in farm prices. A midsummer survey of agricultural credit conditions showed that more Ninth District bankers expected decreases rather than increases in farm capital spending in the third quarter. In spite of these expectations, farm machinery sales have been good thus far in 1993, a North Dakota implement dealers representative said. "The biggest limitation on sales is the inability of dealers to get as much as they want."
Pleasant weather and successful marketing enabled Ninth District tourism businesses to enjoy a busy summer. An official in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan reports motel/hotel traffic in August up 5 to 6 percent over last year. Northern Wisconsin resort owners and campground operators laud this summer as the best in five years, according to a local newspaper. Businesses near Duluth, Minn., report double digit increases over last year's rainy summer. Visits at South Dakota campgrounds are up about 5 percent for July and August compared to 1993, and several South Dakota tourist attractions reportedly will set attendance records this year. Major attractions in Montana claim single digit increases to slight declines, staying close to last summer's record pace.
However, directors and industry sources report little wage or price pressure. Hourly manufacturing earnings in Minneapolis-St. Paul are up barely 1 percent from a year ago. Petroleum prices have increased, with most motor fuels 5 to 8 cents above year-earlier levels in August. Newsprint prices reportedly have also risen.
