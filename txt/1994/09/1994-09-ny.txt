Reports on District economic developments were by and large more favorable in recent weeks. Most retail contacts posted July sales results that were on or above plan and homebuilders noted a pickup in activity after some earlier slowing. Office leasing activity showed some recent improvement and unemployment rates declined in the District during August. Senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks reported strength in business loan demand but weakness in the mortgage and consumer sectors.
With the exception of one chain which has been attempting to pare inventories for the past several months, retailers described inventories as both current and on plan.
Office leasing activity has shown some improvement in parts of the metropolitan area. During July the primary office vacancy rate in midtown Manhattan fell by half a percentage point and in the second quarter, Westchester County posted its largest decrease in available office space since the end of 1991. On Long Island, a 20-year lease was recently signed for two of the Grumman Corporation buildings being vacated--the largest commercial real estate transaction on the island thus far this year.
Demolition of the unused Eastern Airlines terminal at Kennedy Airport began in August in preparation for construction of the first new terminal to be built there in over 20 years. An international consortium will build and operate the terminal which will have 11 gates, each able to accommodate the largest jets in use. The new activity is particularly welcome at Kennedy, which had been severely impacted by the demise or downsizing of some of its major tenants.
Several department store chains have reportedly expressed interest in acquiring some of the stores that will likely be divested in the metropolitan area as a result of the Macy-Federated merger. These acquisitions would mitigate any adverse employment effect of the merger. On the other hand, Mayor Giuliani recently ordered New York City agencies to make additional cuts totaling $250 million and to prepare for the possibility of cutting yet another $200 million in the months ahead. Further employment cutbacks are likely to result. In addition, G.E. announced plans to reduce its manufacturing work force in Schenectady by 1200 over the next several months.
While nearly three-quarters of the surveyed banks noted no change in their willingness to lend, one-quarter reported an increase. The banks have not altered their credit standards, and more than four-fifths reported stable or lower delinquency rates. Despite the latest increase in the prime rate, the spread between the average lending and deposit rate has generally held steady, with fewer than two-fifths of the banks reporting a wider spread.
