While the First District economy continues to expand, recent economic conditions appear to be somewhat less robust than earlier in the summer. Some retailers, especially apparel merchants, report weakening sales, but hard goods and food are still selling well. Manufacturing sales results are mixed, and prices are reported to be stable, with a few exceptions. Commercial real estate continues to strengthen in most of the region, as evidenced by noticeable declines in office vacancy rates. Investment management companies report lower sales in the second quarter than in the first.
Retail contacts were hesitant to predict results for the remainder of the year, and several perceive a "general spending malaise." Retailers of apparel anticipate sales increases of less than 2 percent compared to year-ago levels, while hardware and food retailers expect sales to continue growing at a steady 4 to 5 percent. Most contacts report little or no change in vendor or retail prices. Lean and more tightly controlled inventories have reportedly contributed to improved profits this year.
This summer's tourism has been exceptionally strong. Boston's hotel occupancy rates were up 5 percent in the first seven months of 1994 compared to year-ago levels, and up 11 percent in July compared to July 1993. The growth in tourists is attributed mostly to large conventions and international visitors particularly those from Britain and Germany.
Contacts generally indicate that materials costs and output prices are stable. However, one contact notes that costs for fibers have increased 3 to 5 percent, and another has agreed to fiber price hikes in early 1995. A purchaser of paper has experienced cost increases of 15 to 20 percent since July, but a paper manufacturer notes that prices remain depressed relative to historical norms. Prices of computers and components remain on a downward trend.
Approximately equal numbers of respondents report that employment has decreased, increased, or held steady over the last year. A majority expect the size of their work force to remain unchanged in coming months, but about one-third believe that cutbacks are possible or likely in response to lower sales volumes or cost-cutting pressures. Most contacts report 1994 pay increases of 2 to 4 percent, although a couple indicate that at least some categories of employees are receiving no increase.
Manufacturers generally foresee slow U.S. macroeconomic growth in the coming year, which some attribute to tighter monetary policy. Projections for individual companies vary considerably.
