Tourism is strong in many parts of the District. Strong gains are reported in eastern Oregon. The Portland airport reports a 16 percent increase in passenger traffic in the first four months of the year from a year earlier. Tourism is reported to be rebounding in Hawaii, giving a boost to retail sales.
The demand for telecommunication services in California is reported to be strengthening slowly. Cellular subscriptions in the Pacific Northwest are reported to be increasing at a substantially accelerated pace. In Idaho, computer programmers are earning higher wages as the growth in demand outstrips the increase in supply.
Oil prices have risen, but remain relatively low. The proposal to allow Alaskan crude oil to be exported may improve prices for oil producers in California's Central Valley by reducing supplies on the West Coast. Lumber and plywood prices are reported to be firming after falling between December 1993 and mid-May. Electricity prices in the Pacific Northwest are reported lower because of the additional water being spilled over the dams in the area to help the salmon run.
Construction activity remains strong in many parts of the District. In Arizona and the intermountain states, both residential and commercial building is reported strong, with shortages of construction materials and skilled labor reported in these areas. Residential construction is reported flat in Northern California, improving in Southern California, and down from earlier levels in the Central Valley. In Salt Lake City, the airport is expanding and several new hotels are under construction. Interest rate increases are reported to have slowed the development of affordable housing in Southern California.
