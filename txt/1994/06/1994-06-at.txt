Contacts in commercial and multifamily real estate markets report sustained improvement in these sectors. Multifamily occupancy rates continue to rise, and rental rates also have been increasing. New apartment developments have been announced recently in many areas of the District.

Currently, most construction continues to be build-to-suit and public buildings, although the number of these projects has increased in the last few months.
