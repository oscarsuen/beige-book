Among key industries, District steel production rose on a seasonally adjusted basis in April and May, climbing to its highest level for May since 1989. Output is expected to slow somewhat in coming months, however, partly because some large integrated mills an bringing production facilities down for necessary maintenance and repair. Third quarter production is still "sold out," with continued strength in orders from the motor vehicle, appliance, farm machinery, and construction equipment industries. Reports from manufacturers of farm machinery and construction equipment remained upbeat. Production and retail sales of heavy-duty trucks continued to climb in recent months, although current schedules imply a small decline in output in the third quarter. An industry analyst stated that any output gain in the latter half of the year is not likely to be significant, given current capacity levels, but order backlogs are still believed to be of high quality, and the order cancellation rate remains below year-earlier levels and well within historical norms.
The recent slowdown in auto industry momentum is coming from high sales levels, however, and most industry contacts expressed optimism about renewed growth in the latter half of the year. Some industry analysts have expressed concern that a surge in cars coming off lease could curb new car sales during 1994 and into 1995, much like the bubble of "nearly new" cars that arose after the acceleration in deliveries to captive rental car fleets in the early 1990s. A large automaker emphasized that it has planned its leasing promotions to avoid a serious problem in this area. No car dealers expressed concern about the phenomenon, with one noting that "the average person holds on to a new car for three years, if they buy it or if they lease it. We don't see this being a very big deal." Another dealer expected the increased share of leasing to promote new car sales by encouraging people to buy new cars more often. Asked what happened when 2-3 year old cars started coming back into the dealership, this contact stated "we can't buy enough 2-3 year old cars as it is." An automobile dealers' association reported that its measure of dealer optimism rose to an all-time high in April. A large automaker stated that pent-up demand for motor vehicles remains substantial and should provide a strong base for growth over the balance of 1994 and into 1995.
Growth in total payroll employment in the District has fallen in line with the national average during 1994, but help-wanted advertising and unemployment rate estimates point to relatively tight labor markets in the region. For example, among the 11 large states for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics computes direct unemployment rate estimates, Michigan and Illinois had the second and third lowest unemployment rates, respectively, during May, while the unemployment rate in Michigan has fallen to a 20-year low during 1994. The unemployment rates for Indiana, Iowa and Wisconsin are below those for Illinois and Michigan, and the gap between the District unemployment rate and the national average continued to widen in the District's favor this year.
