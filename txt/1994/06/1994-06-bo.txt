Economic activity continues to pick up in the First District. Among manufacturers, the recovery appears to have broadened considerably. Retailers, by contrast, seem to fall into either a high- growth or a no-growth camp. While prices charged by manufacturing and retail contacts are generally holding steady, some materials costs reportedly are increasing.
Retail contacts' expectations also vary widely, with a range from 0 to 20 percent in anticipated sales growth over the next six months compared to a year earlier. Most contacts report little or no change in their own or vendor prices, with the exception of increases for wood products. Many retailers say they are struggling to maintain gross margins by cutting operating costs and reducing inventories. Employment levels remain flat, but a few contacts plan major capital expansions this year or next.
Manufacturers producing consumer nondurables have increased prices by 2 to 5 percent, but most others report no possibility of raising prices. A majority of respondents cite some materials cost increases. Prices of steel, aluminum, copper, paper, chemicals, and plastics are reported to be creeping up, although one producer notes that paper prices remain below their level of a year ago. Prices of cotton and flax fibers have risen noticeably since the beginning of the year.
Most contacts do not appear concerned about materials inflation, in part because some other costs are falling. One-third of the respondents report success in negotiating reductions in purchased goods and services prices. Half express intentions to continue to prune their work force or introduce other efficiencies.
Manufacturers generally expect continued growth in the U.S. economy and their own business. However, those who depend on consumer durables spending expect their growth to slow as a result of rising interest rates.
The nonresidential construction industry is reported to be in fairly good shape after a hard winter, with one contact reporting that new business is coming from renovations of existing retail and institutional space. Margins are up and are expected to continue to rise.
