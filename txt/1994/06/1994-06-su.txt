Districts report continued economic expansion, although in some areas growth has moderated recently. Contacts in a number of districts report slower-than-expected growth in May retail sales but some signs of increasing sales in early June. Manufacturing continued to show strength in most districts, with many contacts reporting increases in new orders and shipments. Defense-related industries, however, continue to be the weak spots. Home sales in most areas continued at a strong pace, and residential construction remains generally brisk, but some slowdowns in response to rising mortgage rates were noted. Industrial materials prices continue to rise; however, competitive pressures are mitigating price increases for finished goods. Some districts report tightening labor markets, but wage pressures appear moderate at this point. Loan demand is generally increasing, although rising interest rates have precipitated declines in some areas. Crop conditions are generally favorable in most agricultural areas; nevertheless, some districts are expressing rising concern over warm, dry weather.
Contacts in parts of the Kansas City, Minneapolis and St. Louis districts are having difficulty finding qualified employees. The St. Louis and San Francisco districts both repast a shortage of skilled construction workers. Contacts in the New York district anticipate few employment cuts and see wage increases of between 2 percent and 4 percent. Contacts in the Richmond district plan no employment changes, but do expect to increase the average length of the workweek.
Foreign demand for products from most districts remains somewhat sluggish. The Dallas and St. Louis districts, however, report some strengthening demand from Latin America and the Pacific Rim countries, respectively. In addition, the Dallas district reports strong chemical sales to Europe. The Kansas City district reports that exports are stable overall.
Both the Atlanta and St. Louis districts report defense-related layoffs; the San Francisco district reports its defense-related industries remain weak. The Boston district says its durables producers are concerned that rising interest rates will reduce demand for their products, and Philadelphia district contacts are less optimistic now than they were at the beginning of the year.
The Minneapolis district reports that the commercial construction market is strong, and the Richmond district reports recent improvements in this market. The Philadelphia district, however, reports a soft commercial market with slightly increasing vacancy rates. The Boston district reports declining vacancy rates in Boston, although Hartford's have increased. The New York district reports falling vacancy rates in Manhattan, and the Richmond district says that vacancy rates arc falling throughout the district except in northern Maryland and West Virginia.
Recent increases in crude oil prices have spurred slightly higher drilling activity in the Kansas City district, but little noticeable increase in the Dallas district. Minneapolis, on the other hand, reports a decrease in petroleum drilling activity in North Dakota and Montana. The Minneapolis and San Francisco districts report that lumber prices have increased, while Minneapolis indicates that recent increases in copper and steel prices have benefited district producers.
