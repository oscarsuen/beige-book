Many District manufacturers report a modest improvement in foreign orders, although the domestic economy, led by automobile-related manufacturing, is apparently providing the primary thrust to the region's industrial sector. Capital goods orders and shipments are reportedly running 10% or more above year-ago levels, and of these, metal-forming equipment is noted to be particularly strong, perhaps because of the rapid expansion of consumer durable-goods production.
Apparel sellers were the least positive of the respondents. Specialty stores are "struggling" to boost sales with promotions and special pricing, and clothing demand at department stores has been flat. Colder-than-average temperatures in May account for some of the slowdown. Cool weather is being blamed for slower-than-desired sales of seasonal building materials and garden supplies.
However, sellers of appliances and, to a lesser degree, furniture continue to report a very positive performance. Appliance dealers note that while year-over-year sales at comparable outlets are not improving at the double-digit rates seen in the first quarter, high single-digit gains are not uncommon. Sales growth has been broad based, but demand for computers and related equipment has been especially strong.
In contrast to dealers of domestic nameplate vehicles, Japanese auto dealers report sufficient stocks of most vehicles. They also note slower sales improvements relative to U.S. manufacturers.
Although auto lending rates have risen 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point in the past month or so, area dealers see little direct effect on sales. Some dealers suggest that the rapidly expanding lease market may have partially insulated consumers from the cost of higher interest rates.
Business lending is generally growing, with one respondent reporting that activity is stronger now than six months ago. Inventory financing needs and capital spending plans that had previously been financed internally lead some observers to anticipate a continuation of business loan growth. However, a cautionary note was sounded by at  east one respondent, whose institution saw commercial loans dip in May.
On the deposit side, flows of funds into small certificates of deposit and money market mutual funds appear to have increased substantially, apparently attracted by the recent rate increases on these instruments.
