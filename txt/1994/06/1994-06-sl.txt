Growth is occurring in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms in all parts of the District. For example, two poultry processors report new plants opening in Kentucky, one initially bringing 850 jobs, and the other bringing 1,300. An apparel maker will also move to Kentucky and employ 600 by year's end. Contacts in western Tennessee report the opening of a new auto parts plant, employing 500 workers, and the expansion of a paper factory, adding 200 workers. A greeting card company, expanding into northeast Arkansas, will employ 250 workers. Because of a new contract, a St. Louis corporate services firm hired an additional 400 workers. A heavy equipment dealer says demand has outpaced supply, creating severe shortages but leading to sales increases of more than 20 percent over last year. Other contacts also report sales increases over last year and expectations that this will continue at least through next quarter. For example, a building supplies company and a pallet manufacturer both report sales increases of 15 percent, while a die casting company's sales grew 10 percent.
Domestic markets remain strong for most products, particularly animal feed, although some slowdowns in the hospitality and metal plate products industries were noted. Reports about foreign markets vary with company and destination. Most say that overall exports are weak with only the Pacific Rim countries as a source of rising demand.
Most reports of layoffs in the District are defense-related. An army base reports it will lay off about 250 civilian employees by the end of September because of restructuring within the military. An electronics company producing engines and other parts for defense aircraft laid off 100 white-collar employees because of spending cuts, and a missile producer will eliminate about 240 positions because of scheduled production decreases. Separately, the catfish industry reports that nationwide shortages of catfish are causing firms to release workers. One firm laid off its entire night shift of 295 people.
Most discussions with area business people suggest that cost pressures are minimal. In general, the largest average reported increase was about 3 percent. Many of these contacts state that increased foreign competition prevents them from increasing prices on their products. Some even stipulated that when presented with opportunities to raise prices, they decided not to. In addition, some claim they can now find their raw materials overseas when there is a shortage domestically, which helps to keep prices down. The consensus among contacts was that District wage increases are running between less than 1 percent and 3 percent.
