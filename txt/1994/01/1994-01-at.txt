Reports from the tourism and recreation industries suggest that bookings from domestic and South American tourists are up, while those from Europe are lower. Winter travel to Miami is said to have fallen this year because of reports of crime; however, activity north of the city is reported to be a bit stronger than normal. Casinos and riverboat gambling continue to stimulate tourist activity in Mississippi and now in Louisiana.
In contrast, the region's apparel producers continue to report strong foreign competition and soft demand resulting in further employee cutbacks and a shrinking factory workweek.

Commercial and multifamily real estate contacts said that market conditions are improving. While build-to-suit and retail projects continue to provide most new construction, slowly falling vacancy rates for office and industrial space have helped effective rental rates improve. In addition, several contacts reported that large blocks of space are becoming difficult to find in the most desirable areas, and that some speculative building may be possible in these areas by the first quarter of 1995.
