First District businesses continue to report small gains.. Although recent results are mixed in all categories, retailers are generally less pleased than manufacturers or residential real estate professionals. Nonetheless, all three groups are moderately optimistic about 1994. Insurance companies are less upbeat.
Retail contacts noted some unusual holiday shopping patterns this year. Durables were a big seller, particularly electric appliances, whereas apparel, especially women's clothing, did poorly. Sales fluctuated from one day to the next without obvious explanations. Early promotions generated a busier-than-usual week after Thanksgiving, but continued promotions failed to produce a hoped-for surge the week before Christmas. Retailers observed fewer impulse purchases by shoppers.
Despite the ups and downs of December sales, retailers say they are optimistic about 1994, sensing increased consumer confidence. Department and specialty stores anticipate modest sales growth of 1 to 5 percent; the merchants with strong December results expect sales to grow by as much as 10 percent. All contacts plan to open new stores in 1994 and to raise employment levels accordingly.
Contacts see little evidence of inflation, as selling prices are being limited by competition, greater operating efficiencies, and lack of cost pressures. Only one-quarter of the respondents report any increases in materials costs. These generally lie in the range of 3 to 4 percent, and are attributable largely to specialized electronics products and, more recently, textiles. Lumber prices have nearly stabilized after large jumps.
About four-fifths of the manufacturers contacted have reduced employment during the past year. Most of these businesses now plan to stabilize their head counts, although further declines are expected at some manufacturers of aircraft parts. The other one-fifth have increased their employment during the past year by 7 percent or more, and plan to expand their capacity in the coming year.
First District manufacturers generally express optimism about the coming year. They are heartened by higher incoming orders, the reported strength in the U.S. economy (especially in consumer durables), and improved business profitability. Exporters expect a small pickup in European markets. Several contacts express hope that interest rates will remain stable in order to sustain economic recovery.
