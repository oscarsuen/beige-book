In Ohio, employment grew by nearly 3-1/2% in 1993, outpacing the 2% increase nationally. However, virtually all of the state's employment gains occurred during the final two months of the year. Jobs growth in Pennsylvania was a more moderate 1% last year. Unemployment in the District was just below the national rate (6.2% and 6.3% in Ohio and Pennsylvania, respectively, compared with 6.4% nationally). The jobless rates are all down about I percentage point from a year ago.
Virtually all of the District's major capital goods producers were reporting continued strong orders, particularly in the automotive area. However, defense-related cutbacks have been felt in the region, and export markets, particularly western Europe, have slackened considerably. The performance of the District's export markets remains an important question mark in the outlook for 1994. Nevertheless, domestic capital-goods demand remains very strong, and most firms were thought to be operating near capacity. All of the producers we contacted noted rising backlogs.
While some manufacturers indicated little upward price pressure, most were reporting higher costs, particularly for materials such as steel scrap, and many expected planned 1994 price increases to stick.
Somewhat in contrast to the 1992 holiday season, much of the recent increase in Ohio retail activity appears to have occurred at department stores, although performance varied considerably by establishment. While discounters and off-price stores achieved small sales gains, and furniture and appliance stores did well, only specialty retailers seemed to actually lose sales on a year-over-year basis. Apparel sales here, as nationally, were noted to be particularly weak.
Retailers are still reporting thin profit margins-many reduced prices significantly prior to Christmas. Although retailers were not caught short on inventory this holiday season (as most were last year), many described stocks as merely adequate.
Retailers appear to be optimistic about consumer spending this year. Even apparel sellers believe that retail sales will likely strengthen in the first quarter.
Dealers cite a variety of reasons for their strong year-end performance. Most say that improved income and jobs prospects resulted an more consumer optimism than at any time since the recession. Domestic model manufacturers say that price increases on many of the 1994 models have been modest and that interest rates continue to be very favorable. Leasing is still a popular option.
Consumer loan demand was characterized as solid, particularly for automobiles. The overall increase in consumer borrowing furthers a strengthening pattern that became evident last summer. Commercial credit is reported to have picked up surprisingly in the fourth quarter, although some of the improvement may be a result of increased floor-plan activity due to the rise in retail sales.
