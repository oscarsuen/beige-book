As 1993 ended, most economic sectors in the Ninth Federal Reserve District showed signs of growth. Commercial and residential construction is very active in virtually all areas of the district. Manufacturing, particularly in small and midsize firms, continues to grow. Refinery production is up, demand for construction-related forest products remains high and prospects for iron mining are positive. Conditions are unchanged in agriculture, which ended 1993 with much lower grain stocks than a year earlier and essentially stable livestock output. Consumer spending through the holiday season continued improving at the pace set earlier in the fall. After a slow start, winter recreation enterprises report good business. Unemployment rates remain substantially below those of the United States as a whole and employment is up from year-earlier levels. There is little evidence of upward pressure on wages or prices.
Production of oriented-strand board and other wood-based plywood and lumber substitutes is very strong in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. But the forest products industry's outlook continues to vary by product and location. A recent timber sale in Montana set a record for stumpage prices in that state, reflecting generally declining quantities of timber offered for sale. The paper industry continues to experience overcapacity and low prices, but output is essentially stable.
"Mine operators are generally optimistic about 1994 and expect output to exceed levels of the previous three years," said one iron ore industry spokesperson. This is in spite of a slight output decline in 1993 relative to 1992, largely related to a strike-related closing of one mine. Other mining is essentially stable. Copper and gold output is unchanged from earlier in the year. Copper prices have recovered slightly from lows set earlier in the year, allaying fears of possible mine closings.
In the closing weeks of 1993 the winter tourism and recreation season picked up momentum, particularly in Montana. Lack of snow in several ski areas had retarded activity in November and early December, but snowfalls just before Christmas improved business considerably. Ski resorts in Montana report strong holiday seasons that helped recovery from the slow start, although decreased traffic from Canada continues to hamper resorts near the border. One source reported that snowmobile rental companies at Bozeman, Mont., and near Yellowstone National Park were booked through March. Snowmobilers and skiers were traveling to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and northern Wisconsin at slightly higher than year-earlier rates at the end of December and in early January. Tourist traffic to the Black Hills was steady in South Dakota.
Directors, industry sources and news media report virtually no upward price movements except for those grains where 1993 production was curtailed by flooding. In the last weeks of 1993, retail gasoline prices stood 5 to 7 cents below 1992 levels in Minneapolis-St. Paul and even sharper drops were reported in some other areas. District and branch directors report very limited wage increases for both private and public sector workers, in some cases limited to maintenance of health insurance coverage in the face of premium increases.
