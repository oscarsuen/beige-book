Contacts indicate that furniture and household goods, including appliances and towels, were the best sellers this holiday season. Sales of toys and consumer electronics were also strong. Women's apparel and shoes, usually a strong source of holiday sales, did not do as well as expected. Most retailers are anticipating a solid 1994, with some predicting as much as 10 percent sales growth in the first half of the year. Similarly, most auto dealers contacted are expecting 1994 to equal or surpass 1993's strong year.
A few minor setbacks were also reported, some of which had been anticipated. For example, an auto plant closed on schedule in December, eliminating the remaining 1,200 jobs. A bakery that was displaced by airport expansion dismissed 525 workers when it finally closed its doors, another anticipated closure. An auto parts maker will close its plant early this year, laying off more than 260 workers. A defense contractor let another 200 workers go after the cancellation of a program.
A national temporary employment agency's recent survey of the St. Louis area reveals that 12 percent of the firms plan to hire during the first quarter of 1994. This is down from 20 percent one year ago. Nationally, 18 percent plan to hire this quarter. According to a recent survey of District firms by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, 14 percent think now is a good time to expand. However, 23 percent of the surveyed firms increased their average selling price between August and November, while just 10 percent reduced prices. About 24 percent plan to increase prices during the first quarter of 1994 (4 percent will decrease prices), and 35 percent plan to increase capital expenditures. More than half of the respondents felt current inventories were at acceptable levels, but only 43 percent will keep them at the same level during the first half of the year. The remaining 57 percent are split between increasing or decreasing their inventories.
