Reports from Third District business contacts in early January were generally positive. Manufacturers said demand for their products picked up in December and that both shipments and new orders were moving up at the beginning of January. Retailers indicated that Christmas sales ran a bit above their expectations, which had ranged around 5 percent in dollar terms on a year-over-year basis. The increases appeared to be broad-based among types of stores and varieties of merchandise. Bankers generally described loan demand as steady or slightly up, due in large part to seasonal factors, although they indicated that mortgage refinancing activity had eased significantly.
The outlook in the Third District business community is positive although not strongly optimistic, with most of those contacted for this report forecasting continued moderate improvement in 1994. Manufacturers expect to see orders grow through the first half, and they indicate they may step up hiring as the new year progresses. Retailers expect sales to increase in line with overall economic growth. Bankers believe consumer credit is on a growth trend and some noted signs of increased interest in borrowing by businesses as well.
The outlook among Third District manufacturers is generally optimistic. Among those contacted for this report, just over half expect business to improve through the first half of the year, while around one-third anticipate steady conditions, and only a few expect business to decline. Overall, area manufacturers expect orders and shipments to grow over the next six months, and they plan to hire more workers during the period.
Retailers said they believe consumer confidence is growing, but they do not forecast strong gains in spending. Looking ahead, merchants expect sales to be seasonally slow during the winter but to pick up about in line with overall economic growth in the spring.
