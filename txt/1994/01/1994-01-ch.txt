Discussions with individual retail firms were largely consistent with the picture painted by survey data, and several large retailers indicated that moderate sales growth continued in early January. One large chain that reported relatively strong holiday sales gains stated that sales growth strengthened, if anything, in late December and early January. Another large chain reported that sales growth increased significantly in early January, with sales gains in the District running in line with the national average. Bigger-ticket items (including housewares and electronics) continued to lead overall sales, and hard-line inventories were running below plan for the first time in several months. This contact noted that post-holiday season promotional activity was somewhat stronger than last year, but did not express a great deal of concern in light of thesurprisingly strong sales pace in the holiday season for 1992. Retail prices continue to rise slowly at best, and most firms indicated that competitive pressures on margins were little changed, including those that enjoyed relatively successful seasons. With the dramatic exception of Rose Bowl items sold in Wisconsin, reports generally indicated that apparel sales remained relatively weak. One department store chain stated that a shift in sales mix would constrain its overall margin relative to last year, but consumers seem to have extended their purchases beyond the basics within low-margin categories to a greater extent than they did in the 1992 holiday season.
Reports from individual manufacturing firms generally reflected a rising note of optimism about prospects in the new year, although growth was expected to moderate in several durable goods markets following strong gains in 1993. A large steelmaker noted that space on order books is on an allocation basis into the second quarter of 1994, and the auto industry remained its strongest market. A machine tool manufacturer reported continuing strength in orders from automakers and their suppliers, but stated that overall industry orders growth should slow somewhat in 1994 after a strong year in 1993. Pricing and margins remain under considerable pressure from European and Japanese machine tool producers with underutilized capacity. Heavy-duty truck orders strengthened further, according to an industry analyst. This contact stated that many industry suppliers are "stretched to their limits." A manufacturer of fluid power equipment expected further gains in output of construction machinery and other forms of heavy equipment.
