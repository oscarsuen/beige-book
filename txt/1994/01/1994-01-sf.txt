Conditions in service-related industries are mixed. A contact in the newspaper industry reports that advertising activity was disappointing in 1993, but showed an increase in both volume and revenue during the fourth quarter. The southern California visitor industry is reported in the doldrums. Hotel occupancy in the region was very weak in the fourth quarter, and while bookings for early 1994 are above a year earlier, it is uncertain whether actual occupancy rates will improve. Hotel occupancy also is reported to be still dropping in Hawaii.
Capital spending plans are reported generally cautious in most industries. Commercial lenders in Oregon report that, with the exception of the high technology industry, the general sentiment is one of caution for capital spending in 1994, with the level planned at or slightly above the 1993 level. A contact in the auto dealer industry, however, reports that low interest rates are having a beneficial effect on capital expenditures.
