A large realtor reported that existing home sales transactions were about in line with last year, but noted that listings have been moving down for the first time in a long time. This contact stated that higher mortgage interest rates probably brought more buyers into the market in the first quarter, potentially borrowing from sales later in the year. A large association of homebuilders in the Chicago area reported that traffic increased from strong year-earlier levels In the first quarter, but then fell off during April. While many builders have expressed concern about the impact of higher mortgage interest rates, this contact believed buyer confidence remains strong.
The latest survey of District agricultural bankers found the farmland market strengthened further this winter. The two percent gain reported for the three months ending with March was fairly widespread throughout the District, and it was the largest such increase in several quarters. The volume of farmland transfers picked up during the winter months, fueled both by a stronger demand among buyers and a pick up in offerings for sale.
