A moderate recovery continues in the First District. Most of the retailers, manufacturers, and residential realtors contacted reported increased activity in recent months, although some results are negative.
The region's retailers are reasonably optimistic about the next six months, anticipating modest sales growth of 3 to 5 percent over last year. Inventories are up slightly in anticipation of increased sales. Employment levels are expected to rise slightly, and contacts generally intend to increase wages about 3.5 percent.
Manufacturers report only minor increases in materials costs, with the exception of double-digit inflation for cotton fibers and copper. Contacts generally indicate no possibility of passing through higher costs, because of highly competitive sales markets. Prices for computers and other equipment continue to fall, at an accelerated rate in the case of major hospital equipment. Wage increases range up to 3 or 4 percent, but reportedly are offset by productivity gains.
About one-third of this month's respondents (serving consumer durables and electronics markets) are expanding capacity. Worldwide capacity constraints for some computer parts reportedly are or may soon be delaying selected deliveries. One automotive parts supplier, by contrast, notes being able to increase utilization at either domestic or foreign plants to fill booming orders from Detroit.
Two-fifths of manufacturing contacts report that the size of their work force increased over the past year, two-fifths that it decreased, and the remainder that it held steady. Weak sales or cost-cutting efforts are expected to continue to lead to employment reductions at some large companies.
Manufacturers' views about the future range from optimism (resulting from perceived strength in the U.S. economy or their own earnings gains) to caution (resulting from tighter monetary policy or weakness in particular markets). Exporters anticipate a modest upturn in European demand starting in late 1994.
