Reports on District economic developments were by and large more favorable in recent weeks, suggesting that the pace of economic activity has been picking up in recent months. Most retail contacts posted February and March sales results that were above expectations, homebuilders in several areas noted an increase in traffic and contracts, and office vacancy rates declined. District payroll employment continued to show over-the-year gains. Most loan officers at small and midsized banks indicated no change in their willingness to lend from two months earlier.
Over-the-year sales changes ranged from -3 percent to +13 percent in February and from +3 percent to +17 percent in March, with the majority of contacts reporting double-digit gains in March. While better-than-expected sales reduced inventories more than was intended at some stores, the majority of respondents still found stocks to be at sufficiently comfortable levels to avoid any difficulties in meeting demand. In general, retailers were cautiously optimistic about what lies ahead.
After several years of little or no new construction activity in Manhattan, three large, mixed-use towers are going up in the Lincoln Center area that will contain substantial amounts of new retail and entertainment space together with rental and condominium apartments. Plans have also been announced to gut a nearby 44-story office building overlooking Central Park in order to reconstruct it with several hundred condominium apartments and possibly some offices as well.
Office leasing activity was fairly brisk in much of the District recently, and primary vacancy rates declined in all of the areas for which data are available except Downtown Manhattan. Lower vacancy rates were posted in northern New Jersey, Westchester County, Fairfield County, Connecticut and on Long Island, which registered a large, two percentage point decline in the first quarter. In addition to the lower vacancy rates, rents have begun to stabilize and smaller concessions are now reportedly being offered to potential commercial space renters.
For the first time in several months, only a few large-scale employment cutbacks have been announced recently. Natwest will shift 1300 jobs out of the District beginning in August; U.S. Surgical, which is headquartered here, will eliminate 900 jobs, and Fleet Financial Group plans to layoff 600 in New York State. The impact on Long Island of Northrup's recent purchase of Grumman remains to be seen.
The March survey of purchasing managers in Buffalo showed an increase in the percentage of firms reporting improved orders, but a decrease in the percentage with greater production. The February survey of purchasing managers in Rochester recorded a rise in the percentage anticipating improved conditions during the next three months.
Lending rates were generally higher for all types of loans, although a few officers mentioned lowering rates on business loans "to meet competition for quality loans." While only a third of the respondents had raised rates on deposits, the majority of those who reported rates unchanged intend to increase them in the near future. Finally, almost all respondents reported either stable or lower delinquency rates during the preceding two months.
