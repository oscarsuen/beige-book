Capital goods producers were uniformly upbeat concerning business conditions. Orders books were active across a broad range of capital goods categories, and were particularly strong in the vehicles area. Heavy and light truck production was at or quickly approaching capacity, and orders backlogs were thought to be commonplace. Respondents cited continuing softness in defense-related and aerospace industries, however.
Some concern was noted that higher mortgage rates suggested the potential for slower home sales that may eventually damp durable goods spending, although no such slowdown was thought to have occurred yet. Durable goods sales continue to lead the retail categories. Apparel sales have picked up from the low levels posted earlier in the year, although pricing of apparel goods was still characterized as very competitive.
While interest rates in the market for auto loans have headed slightly higher (about 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point), new car demand remains robust. A few auto dealers noted increases in the popularity of leasing, which may have minimized the interest-rate effects. Auto dealers reported inventory shortages in several models, even some import makes.
Auto producers have not altered their sales forecast for the year, although the full impact of the recent interest rate increases has apparently introduced an element of uncertainty. More hiring is occurring in some areas, but few auto-related manufacturers plan to expand capacity to meet current demand.
Consumer lending activity was reported to be brisk, even outside the auto-related categories. Loan demand has picked up from mid-March and the early April numbers appear to be good. Competition from nonbank credit sources remains stiff, however.
All of the bankers contacted anticipate further increases in the federal funds rate this year, although they differ in opinion concerning the timing of such actions.
