The economy of the Ninth Federal Reserve District shows strong growth in early spring. Automobile sales are booming and general merchandise sales have reportedly increased. Construction remains strong in comparison to past years and markets for existing residences are tight. Manufacturing sales reportedly continue to strengthen. Mining output shows little change, but petroleum production in the district continues to erode slightly. With favorable weather, the crop season is off to a strong start. Livestock numbers remain high and continue to trend slightly upward. Employment levels are generally 3 percent above year-earlier levels, and unemployment rates remain below the national average and year-earlier levels. There is little evidence of significant upward movement in wages, but employers in sonic regions report difficulty in finding qualified new hires. A few manufacturers report difficulty in securing some inputs.
Tourism is stable. Winter business in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan's Upper Peninsula was slower than normal due to cold weather, according to industry officials and a director. But South Dakota enjoyed a strong ski and snowmobile season. Industry officials are generally optimistic about the summer season; Montana, in particular, is gearing up for a very strong season after a recent spate of laudatory news articles about that state's tourism opportunities.
The Ninth District petroleum sector is reportedly suffering the effects of low crude prices. A director reports that some existing wells are being shut in, and published rig counts are the lowest in 10 years. Crude production is down about 5 percent from a year ago, although refinery throughput is up 12 percent as upgrades at three major refineries have come on stream. Non-ferrous metal mining output shows little change. Ice packed in Lake Superior near the Soo locks continued to impede ore shipping in mid-April but was expected to clear rapidly with warmer weather.
Output of slaughter livestock is strong; numbers of livestock on farms and slaughter levels show moderate growth from year-earlier levels. With higher grain prices, feeding livestock is less profitable than a year ago, but industry observers expect numbers to continue to grow modestly throughout 1994. However, dairy production is down somewhat from comparable periods in 1993 in spite of generally higher milk prices. The decline is most pronounced in Wisconsin, but Minnesota and South Dakota also show some slippage.
Directors and industry sources report wage increases in the 1 percent to 3 percent range for both private and public sector workers. Price increases have been reported for some industrial inputs, including wood particle board and metal finishing chemicals. Several firms reportedly have difficulty in securing desired quantities of particle board, and there is one report of shortages in certain types of steel. Lumber prices remain higher than a year ago, while petroleum fuels continue 3 to 10 cents per gallon below early 1993 levels.
