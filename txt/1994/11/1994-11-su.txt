Economic activity continues to expand in all Federal Reserve districts, according to business contacts; there are signs of acceleration in the Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia districts, while growth has slowed somewhat in the New York district. Consumer spending generally remains strong. Many districts report increased spending, but several districts report flat or slackening retail sales. Auto sales remain very strong. Manufacturing activity increased in nearly all districts, and demand for business services where reported, has accelerated.
Single-family construction has declined from fairly high levels across much of the country. Most districts report gains in commercial real estate activity. Loan demand is advancing at a healthy pace in most districts.
Better-than-expected crop yields have added to record-breaking crop and livestock production nationwide, and large supplies have pushed down agricultural prices. Energy activity has improved, despite relatively weak oil and natural gas prices.
Labor markets are tight or tightening in most districts, although tightness is limited to specific sectors. There are a few reports of rising wages. Prices of raw and intermediate materials continue to rise, and there are increasing reports that manufacturers are passing along these costs by raising selling prices. Most districts report no change in retail prices, although pressure is building in some districts.
The San Francisco district reports continued weakness in the commercial aerospace industry, and in the Boston district, demand for aircraft parts has dropped at double-digit rates. In Central Florida, defense manufacturers' ongoing downsizing and the space industry's cutbacks are slowing economic activity.
The apparel sector continues to shrink in the Atlanta district. Apparel demand is steady in Dallas, and producers are optimistic in the St. Louis district.
Commercial real estate markets have strengthened in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, New York, and Richmond districts, and construction is reported as increasing in many of these markets. Lower vacancy rates are reported for office markets in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, New York, and Richmond districts, and markets for multifamily real estate have tightened in the Atlanta and Dallas districts.
The Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts report that energy activity has improved, despite relatively weak oil and natural gas prices. On-shore drilling in the Dallas and Kansas City districts is reported to be below year-ago levels, although drilling activity was strong in the Gulf of Mexico, where the number of working rigs is the highest since 1990. Mines in the Minneapolis district are reported to be running at capacity.
Labor market tightness has led to rising wages only in the Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts. San Francisco reports tight labor markets, especially for the retail and service sectors, and wages are rising at food stores and for experienced computer programmers. The San Francisco district also reports a shortage of skilled construction workers in Idaho, Oregon, and Utah, where wages are increasing rapidly.
Most districts continue to report that prices of raw and intermediate materials are rising, particularly prices of chemicals, plastic, paper, steel, and cotton. Prices of medical and computer equipment continue to decline, however. The Dallas, Philadelphia, and Richmond districts report that higher costs are being passed along through manufacturers' selling prices. A growing number of factory contacts in the Atlanta and Cleveland districts expect cost pressures to be reflected in finished goods prices soon. Most districts report that retail prices have not risen. In the Atlanta district, however, pressures are growing, and in the Dallas district, retail prices are continuing to fall but at a slower pace.
