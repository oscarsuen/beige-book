One large national chain reported that sales growth improved in the first half of October on a seasonally adjusted basis, after some slowing in the summer. This contact noted that sales of appliances slowed around mid-year. then picked up again in recent months. Total inventories (for this retailer as well as its suppliers) are running in line with plan and moderately higher than last year. However, a higher turn rate and increased confidence in the purchasing department are expected to make the company's own inventory posture somewhat more aggressive in the months ahead. A manufacturer of consumer electronics also reported that inventory levels have been increasing, both at the company and among its dealers, even as inventory has been turning at a faster rate.
Commercial real estate markets continued to strengthen. A large real estate services company stated that the downtown Chicago office market "continues to move in the right direction," and the overall vacancy rate has fallen to its lowest level in over three years. This firm found stronger conditions in the suburban marketplace than the downtown area, with most of the surveyed areas showing record low vacancy rates. A large bank stated that industrial and commercial real estate markets in Chicago are showing "considerable strength, with signs of speculative activity arising for the first time in a long time." A large steel manufacturer noted that an increasing share of new construction projects seems to have a "hurry-up" quality, as firms authorize projects "and scramble to catch up" to meet tighter completion dates.
Among key District industries, steel production moved higher on a seasonally adjusted basis in recent weeks in the region, after plant shutdowns for maintenance contributed to a greater slowdown in output than the seasonal norm late in the summer. One industry analyst stated that nearly all of the major markets for steel produced in the Midwest remain strong, including appliances, heavy equipment, and autos. This contact stated that producers' steel inventories are relatively low, partly because customers have demonstrated greater willingness to hold steel of their own accord. A large auto supplier reported that demand from transplant operations has shown recent renewed strengthening, joining continued strong sales to domestically based manufacturers. This firm expected continued moderate growth in 1995. The company has been adding capacity this year, and "only recently have we seen some stabilization in our ability to meet demand without using overtime." An association of home appliance manufacturers reported that the industry is headed for a record shipments year, topping its previous high in 1987. However, the association is expecting "some kind of a slowdown" in 1995. A number of large manufacturers noted greater momentum in exports to Europe, including producers of construction machinery, material handling equipment, and industrial automation controls.
A growing number of contacts reported difficulty finding skilled workers, but reports of tight labor markets are not universal, even in some of the strongest states in the District. One regional analyst stated that recent cutbacks by three significant employers in central Wisconsin have reinforced a continuing skepticism among workers that labor markets lack the strength and stability apparent in reported statistics. This contact stated that "many workers sense increased risk, and don't see a higher return." Temporary help companies have been reporting increased difficulty attracting employees for available positions, hut heightened competition in the industry has held in check the prices these companies charge the ultimate employer. One large retailer stressed that the company has experienced no abnormal price pressures arising from labor costs, with base wage increases continuing to run below the increases seen in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
