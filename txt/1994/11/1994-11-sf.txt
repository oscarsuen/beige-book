Tourism is strong or improving in most of the District. Hotel occupancy in Salt Lake City remains high. In Southern California, hotel industry conditions have improved significantly but remain below pre-recession levels.
Conditions are mixed among other service industries. In Oregon, business services employment growth has been strong. In the tri-cities area of eastern Washington, economic activity is being held down by cost-cutting at firms under contract to the Department of Energy. In some areas, sales of hospital suppliers are weak, as continued mergers have slowed major purchasing decisions at hospitals.
Labor markets are reported to be tight in many areas, especially for jobs in the retail and service sectors. In several District states, openings for entry level jobs in food stores are remaining vacant at current wages; food store wages are expected to rise 4 to 5 percent in 1995, after rising 3 to 3 1/2 percent in 1994. In Idaho, wages for experienced computer programmers have increased sharply in the past year.
Construction activity remains at a high level in many parts of the District, but growth has moderated in some areas. After earlier strong gains, housing starts slowed in Utah, and commercial construction activity slowed in Idaho. In Los Angeles as a whole, housing permits are up sharply, but construction of affordable housing remains weak. Increases in building activity continue in Arizona and Oregon. Respondents from Idaho, Oregon, and Utah noted a shortage of skilled construction workers. Construction wages and costs of raw materials are reported to be increasing rapidly.
