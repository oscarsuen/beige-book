One contact in the paper industry reports that the third quarter was the best since 1989, with capacity at about 96 percent. A contact in the heating and cooling industry reports a record year, with sales greatly surpassing last year's levels. This contact also noted that a slowdown in orders for the fourth quarter was larger than the normal seasonal decline. A farm equipment dealer states that new equipment sales have picked up very well over the past two months, while used equipment sales have dropped off somewhat. The poultry processing industry is entering Kentucky en masse; another firm announced plans to open a new plant, bringing the total to four within the past year. Makers of wood furniture in northeast Mississippi report that plants are operating at or above capacity, overtime is the norm, and plans for expansion are commonplace. An apparel manufacturer reports optimism about sales for the rest of the year given the current level of orders.
Some manufacturing firms in the southern part of the District report year-to-date sales increases of between 5 percent and 26 percent over last year. Firms throughout the District also report increases in employment levels. For example, a dry cleaning company will bring 300 new jobs into southern Indiana when it moves into refurbished Army facilities. An engine manufacturer will bring 600 jobs to central Missouri when its new plant opens next year. A maker of plumbing fixtures is building a new plant in western Tennessee and will hire at least 200 workers initially. Because of a new contract with a fast food chain, a poultry processor is adding 200 employees at its Missouri plant and will hire almost 500 in Kentucky. A maker of mobile homes that closed a plant in 1991 has reopened it because of high demand; the company has a 600- to 700-home backlog.
All the news is not positive, however, as layoffs and plant closings have also occurred. For example, a maker of tissues and other paper products closed its Memphis plant, eliminating 640 jobs. A maker of plastic products closed its Missouri plant, eliminating 200 positions. An Arkansas shoe company has placed all production employees on a four-day workweek in an attempt to avoid layoffs. A hydraulic pump manufacturer will lay off 175 workers when at closes early next year because of excess capacity.
