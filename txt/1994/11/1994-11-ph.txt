Economic activity in the Third District moved up at a somewhat faster pace in October than in September, according to business contacts. Manufacturers noted stronger growth and reported higher rates of shipments and new orders. Manufacturers also reported increased hiring, on balance. Retailers generally indicated that the pace of sales picked up in October from the prior month although the increase was modest. Bankers reported a slight pickup in commercial and industrial lending and continued growth in consumer lending. Real estate conditions, however, continued to be described as about steady, although there were some positive reports on home sales.
Forecasts by Third District business contacts reflect current trends. Manufacturers foresee continuing gains, and their plans call for some further hiring. Retailers are optimistic that the pace of sales will continue moving up into the holiday shopping period. Bankers expect consumer lending to remain on an upward track, but they are less confident that business lending will continue to increase. For real estate, the outlook is that home sales should stay at their current pace, but construction activity of all types will remain at a low level.
Looking ahead, Third district manufacturers expect improvement to continue through the winter. Nearly half of the firms contacted expect the upward trend of shipments and orders to continue, and about one-third anticipate steady business. Plans at area plants call for some additional hiring and increases in capital spending over the next six months, although, on balance, the gains are expected to be modest.
Managers at area plants continued to note rising prices in October. Over half of those commenting on prices said input costs were going up, and more than one-fourth said they had raised the prices of the goods they manufacture. There were virtually no reports of price decreases.
Although merchants said it is too early to speculate about the level of sales in the upcoming holiday shopping period, the general tenor of opinion is optimistic. Retailers believe that apparel sales will remain healthy and that sales of electronic appliances will increase as the holiday period approaches.
Auto dealers indicated that sales in October were healthy and that the supply shortages that hampered sales of certain models have been largely overcome. They look for a good sales rate to continue through the rest of the year.
Looking ahead, bankers expect consumer lending to remain on an upward trend, but they are unsure of the course of business lending. Several said they expect further growth to be slight, and they expect competition to continue putting pressure on margins. Also, several bankers noted that a continuation of the current rate of loan growth may soon require them to step up funding and raise deposit rates.
Commercial real estate activity remained subdued in October, as it has been for most of the year, according to contacts. The vacancy rate for office buildings was practically steady in central Philadelphia and down slightly in some suburban office markets. Rents in both the central business district and suburban areas continued to show little change.
Construction activity was flat throughout most of the Third District, according to reports received in October. While a few home builders noted recent increases in demand that they were able to meet, construction activity in total has not been strong, and contacts in the real estate industry see no signs of an upturn.
