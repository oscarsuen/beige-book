Business continues to improve in the First District, with the exception of the housing sector. Most retailers and manufacturers report improving results in the late summer and early fall, with corroborating indications from temporary services firms. Insurance companies report small sales increases in the third quarter.
Some retail contacts have observed modest increases in suppliers prices, particularly plastic, paper, and cotton, which will be passed on to customers in some cases. Gross margins remain fairly stable. Inventory levels are generally satisfactory. Retailers with double- digit sales growth report large profits and increases in employment of 12 to 30 percent.
Retail contacts anticipate a strong holiday season with growth in sales of 2 to 20 percent. While none plans large pre-holiday markdowns like those offered last year, all agree that their customers continue to be frugal and discriminating shoppers.
Contacts generally report that they are operating in a stable pricing environment, although a few are able to raise prices, and medical equipment and most computer prices remain on a downtrend. About one-half report unchanged materials costs, in some cases because they have successfully fended off increases by suppliers. The other half report overall increases, typically in the range of 1 to 3 percent. With respect to labor, most reported pay raises are about 3 to 4 percent.
Two-thirds of the manufacturers contacted expect business trends in coming months to be similar to recent performance. The remaining respondents are split as to whether their company will be challenged by a slowdown in the rate of economic growth, or benefited by new products or more favorable export condition.
