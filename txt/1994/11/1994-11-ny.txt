District economic growth slowed somewhat in recent weeks. A majority of retailers surveyed reported lower-than-expected sales and homebuilders noted a slackening of momentum in the market for both new and existing homes. The movement in September unemployment rates was mixed, however, and office vacancy rates fell in many parts of the District. Senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks reported that overall loan demand remained mixed.
Year-to-year sales results in September ranged from flat to +9 percent among surveyed retail chains in the District. Items mentioned as selling well in addition to goods for the home were women's accessories and cosmetics, and men's suits and sportscoats. Early in the month back-to-school merchandise did well. Despite some buildup in inventories as a result of slower-than-planned sales, respondents were generally comfortable with inventory levels but intended to monitor them closely.
Office leasing activity was sufficiently brisk to lower vacancy rates in many parts of the District during the third quarter. The biggest drop was in the 11-county northern New Jersey area where the rate fell by almost a percentage point between June and September. Rates were down by smaller amounts in Fairfield County, (where vacancies were at their lowest level in five years), in Westchester County and on Long Island. However, vacancy rates backed up a bit in both midtown and downtown Manhattan from August to September.
Several developments occurred in recent weeks which should impact positively on the District economy. Ground was broken for two mixed-use projects which have joint public and private sponsorship: a $2.3 billion development in Queens combining residential, commercial and retail components, and a $200 million retail and residential project in downtown Brooklyn. Additionally, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced an $800 million plan to rebuild the largest terminal at Kennedy Airport.
In the area of entertainment and tourism, MTV will develop a studio complex in three adjoining Times Square theatres and Disney has expressed interest in another 42nd Street theatre. New York City has been the location for several new movies in recent months following several years of little moviemaking, and the number of tourists and hotel occupancy rates in the City reached their highest levels in several years.
While more than half of the surveyed officers noted no change in their willingness to lend, over one-third reported increased willingness. Very few banks changed their credit standards, and almost all reported stable or lower delinquency rates. About one-half of the loan officers noted a smaller spread between the average lending and deposit rates following recent increases in deposit rates.
