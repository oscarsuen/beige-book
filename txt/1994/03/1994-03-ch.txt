Heavy-duty truck orders and output surged in the fourth quarter, and an industry analyst reported that assemblies rose further from December to January. Parts shortages are playing a more important role than bad weather in constraining heavy-duty truck production, according to this contact. A construction machinery industry analyst reported that manufacturers were raising production and building inventory to a greater extent than expected during the fourth quarter. A survey of freight forwarders showed sharply higher expectations for trade activity in coming months. District steel output rose 6 percent above year-earlier levels in the first three reporting weeks of 1994, but then plunged during the worst week of cold weather. Even so, output for January as a whole was 2 percent higher than January 1993, and reached the highest January level in the past five years. District steel output recovered only modestly in February, however, with faster growth evident for production in the nation as a whole.
Home sales and construction activity surged in the region as 1993 came to a close, with little sign of a slowdown in the underlying momentum thus far in 1994. Some realty and banking contacts attributed at least part of the increased activity to home buyers' beliefs that mortgage interest rates may have stopped declining, leading sonic to conclude that the recent burst in activity could prove short-lived. Still, reports from local realtor boards in the region remained quite optimistic, with most noting that sales closings rose faster in January and February than in late 1993. At the same time, the bad weather postponed home showings, which could be followed by slower growth in closings in March and April. One of the largest realtors in the District reported that transactions in January rose over 30 percent from year-earlier levels, partly due to special factors, but results were still a good deal better than expected.
