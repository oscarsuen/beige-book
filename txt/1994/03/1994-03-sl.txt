Several employment reductions were reported that were unrelated to bad weather. The most prominent was from a shoe manufacturer, which had already downsized. This manufacturer announced another 5,660 layoffs nationwide, almost 1,750 of which are in Missouri, and the closing of five factories and numerous retail outlets because of increased foreign competition. An aluminum producer released 350 workers because of a worldwide excess supply of aluminum. A beverage company moved an Illinois instant tea plant to New Jersey, eliminating 180 District jobs. A St. Louis-area school district will lay off 700 employees, 400 of whom are teachers, because of budget shortfalls.
On the other hand, numerous expansions throughout the District have been announced. For example, a mortgage company will open a loan processing center in St. Louis, initially employing 500 workers, with 1,500 more workers expected to be added within the next two years. An appliance producer in Louisville has already added more than 350 people this year because of high demand for its products. The poultry industry continues to grow, with one firm expanding its processing plant and hatchery, adding 175 workers, and another soon opening four new plants (exact locations not yet determined). A bicycle manufacturer is coming to Missouri with 500 jobs, and a trucking company is hiring 500 more St. Louis employees to meet its shipping demands. In addition, various manufacturers report sales increases in January of between 4 percent and 30 percent over one year ago. Finally, a Mississippi manufacturer of bathroom fixtures reports that it has made its first export shipment to Japan.
The Army Corps of Engineers reports rising river levels in many places along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. In some cases, this is normal for this time of year. Reports from the Corps and the National Weather Service predict that, over the next 30 days, the Mississippi River will exceed flood stage in some areas south of St. Louis and approach flood stage north of St. Louis. No major flooding is expected at this time, however.
Southern pine lumber mills report that orders on a year-to-date basis are down nearly 12 percent over the same period last year. An industry contact, however, reports that such mills expect to see some increase in demand stemming from the rebuilding efforts in the aftermath of the California earthquake.
