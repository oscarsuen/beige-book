In spite of unseasonably cold and snowy weather, the economy of the Ninth Federal Reserve District continued to grow in January and February 1994. Construction remains strong in comparison to past years, and commitments to new projects indicate that the spring and summer construction season is likely to be active. Markets for existing housing are tight. Manufacturing sales apparently are strong and output of building materials has increased. Mining and energy output is stable. In agriculture, anticipated plantings are up from 1993, and livestock numbers remain high. Consumer confidence in Minnesota is at a five-year high, and retail spending throughout the district is reportedly vigorous, especially for cars and lighttrucks. Winter recreation businesses are generally having a good season. Employment levels are 2 percent to 3 percent above year-earlier levels in most Ninth District states, and unemployment rates generally remain below the national average. Overall there is little evidence of upward pressure on wages or prices.
Virtually all areas of the Ninth District experienced extended periods of extremely cold weather and high snowfalls in January and February, but the overall economic effects apparently were not large. Construction is normally slow in winter, and recent cold spells did not abnormally reduce activity. Retail sales were reportedly depressed on very cold days, but rebounded when the weather moderated. Cold weather made some livestock care more difficult, but has not noticeably affected output. A few ski areas reported slack business during cold periods, but snowmobiling was not reduced, and overall winter recreation activity is good. There are concerns about spring flooding along some rivers and that ice could delay the 1994 Great Lakes shipping season.
Building-related manufacturing is particularly active; one advisory council member from west-central Wisconsin noted that two window manufacturers in his town were enlarging their factories. Production of oriented-strand board and other wood-based plywood and lumber substitutes continues strong in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. Demand for sawn lumber from Montana and South Dakota is reportedly high, but output remains below historic levels due to limitations on timber sales from federal land. Paper output from virgin pulp is unchanged from a year ago, but production of paper from recycled inputs has raised total production slightly.
Crude petroleum production and drilling activity were essentially unchanged while refinery output in January and early Feburary was  about 9 percent above year-earlier levels. Mining shows little change from recent reports. Copper and gold output apparently remains steady from late 1993. New gold mines continue in the planning or permitting process in South Dakota and Montana, but are not expected to be in production this year. Iron ore officials continue to anticipate that production in the 1994 season will be the highest thus far in the 1990s, though there are concerns that unusually heavy ice coverage on the Great Lakes will delay opening of the shipping season by two weeks or more.
Cattle numbers are higher than a year ago for the district as a whole. Hog numbers are largely unchanged. Newspapers reported that cold weather caused cattle raisers some difficulties with early calving, and there was some speculation that the weather might reduce survival of newborn pigs, but there is little evidence that production was reduced to any significant degree.
In an indication that flood-related financial stress may be easing, banker expectations of farm income and spending for the next three months rose somewhat from earlier in the year, according to a Ninth District survey of agricultural credit conditions at the end of fourth quarter 1993. Agricultural interest rates were unchanged to slightly down.
Winter tourism was strengthening in late February after somewhat slower business in late January and early February. Skiing in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was down slightly for January and February due to cold weather, but out-of-state snowmobilers kept their vacation plans in northern Wisconsin. Numbers of both skiers and snowmobilers are steady on South Dakota trails compared to year-earlier levels. Canadian traffic continues to lag in border states: one Montana ski resort near the border reported a 7 percent drop from last year, though ski business for the whole state was about even with last year.
