Automobile sales were mixed last month, but dealers are optimistic about sales in 1994. Dealers are generally expanding inventories to meet the expected demand. Financing is readily available.
Mortgage refinancing activity has declined, but respondents generally expect the demand for mortgages to rise due to increased homebuying in the spring and summer. Respondents report that mortgage rates have risen and expect rates to increase further over the rest of the year.
No respondents changed their prime rate last month or expect to in the near term. Most banks left their consumer lending rates unchanged and expect no change in the near future. Lending standards were also unchanged.
Deposits were flat to down at most banks. While money market deposit accounts were generally higher, demand deposits, NOW accounts, small time deposits, and large CDs were all mixed.
Most district feedlots are quickly selling off the large inventory of cattle that has built up in recent weeks. High feed prices and weak cattle prices have pushed feeding margins well below break-even. While some feeders continue to wait for higher cattle prices before selling their cattle, most feeders are selling now to limit their losses.
Early reports from year-end credit reviews at district agricultural banks indicate few problem loans and healthy equity levels among district farm borrowers. Federal disaster assistance and higher crop prices cushioned the financial impact of large crop losses caused by wet weather and flooding in the eastern part of the district. Overall, most farm borrowers in the district entered the new year in solid financial condition. But with further losses in the livestock sector, prospects for district farm income have weakened.
