Respondents in all sectors discounted a repeat of the disappointing economic performance of the first half of last year, which followed a strong fourth quarter in 1992. This follows from a widespread belief that economic fundamentals are much stronger now than was the case a year ago.
Activity associated with automobile production continues to be a significant contributor to the District's healthy economic condition. Consistent with previous Fourth District reports, the strength in the auto sector has had a positive collateral impact on the capital goods sector, a trend that is expected to continue throughout 1994.
Retail sales, both auto and nonauto, were indeed hampered by bad weather in much of January and several days in February. However, little concern has been expressed about long-term sales losses. Consumer traffic and sales activity are reported to have jumped sharply during periods of improved weather, and most retailers contacted expressed confidence that lost revenues would be recouped over the balance of the year.
Loan demand, especially for consumer loans, continues to be relatively strong, although there is some feeling that growth in this sector will taper off later in the year.
Although European demand is still characterized as spotty at best, overall foreign demand for capital goods is judged to be good, if not spectacular. Some reports indicate that North American industry is seeing some "straining at capacity," and one contact cited an orders backlog of several months.
Nonetheless, 1994 is expected to be solid, reflecting strong underlying demand due to demographic factors, moderating long-term interest rates, and slight increases in income and employment. Housing markets in the Fourth District have been strong for some time, and more of the same is expected for 1994.
The rise in interest rates has cooled mortgage refinancings, and slower growth in consumer loans is expected to ensue as a result of mortgage borrowing having reached its peak. However, considerable strength is seen as a result of auto demand, including commercial borrowing for dealer floor plans.
