Mortgage activity was steady, as a rise in originations offset a slight fall in refinancings. Rates on residential mortgages rose, which most respondents attributed to the recent tightening by the Federal Reserve. Loan officers had a positive outlook for all categories of lending activity in the near term but suggested that mortgage refinancing activity might taper off further if rates continued to rise.
Commercial real estate conditions continued to improve. Lower vacancy rates in the retail sector were widely reported, and vacancy rates in Charlotte fell to a six-year low. Retail construction was underway in many areas, much of it being built by its discount chain occupants. Similarly, activity in the office and industrial sectors strengthened. Contacts expected a pickup in office leasing activity in the Washington area because a freeze on federal government leasing recently ended. Respondents reported speculative office building construction outside of Raleigh and in the Washington suburbs and noted construction of buildings to be occupied by owners in several other areas. Office rents were higher as a result of reduced landlord concessions and, in some instances, direct rent increases.
