Manufacturing continues its gradual recovery in the First District, but severe winter weather has temporarily set back area retailers. Contacts in both sectors see little price pressure and anticipate moderate growth for the remainder of the year. Commercial real estate continues steady, while investment management firms report strong growth.
Despite the short-term setback, retailers seem more optimistic about this year than last, anticipating 2 to 10 percent growth in sales. Many expect to see gross margins and profits increase as a result of fewer markdowns, better management of inventories, and continued cost controls. Retailers are encouraged by gains in the economy and consumer confidence; however, they remain cautious in their capital spending and hiring plans.
Most manufacturers indicate that severe winter weather caused little disruption in their operations, but a few believe it may have been responsible for a slowdown in orders during January. Cold temperatures have reportedly delayed spring housing construction in some areas, but the California earthquake and last year's Midwest floods have generated considerable construction-related demand.
Most contacts report that their selling prices are flat to down. Sellers of paper and metal products have increased selected prices by up to 3 percent, while cutting other prices. Several manufacturers note that customers are much more sensitive to price than they had been in the past. Automakers are continuing to require price reductions from vendors. Hospitals are forming buying pools. In other markets, prices are being held down by competition. Most raw materials prices remain flat, although contacts report increases for some metals and non- petroleum-based chemicals, as well as cotton fiber. Worldwide capacity constraints are causing increases or an end to decreases for some computer component prices.
Contacts producing for consumer durables markets have increased employment over the past year and are considering further expansions of their work forces. Some industrial goods manufacturers report that employment is flat to up slightly. Most of the remaining contacts, representing over one-third of the sample, have reduced the size of their work forces and will continue doing so in order to cut costs.
Almost all manufacturers plan to increase capital expenditures during the coming year, the majority by substantial amounts. The new capital will serve to expand capacity, produce new products, and raise productivity.
