The economy of the Ninth District continues to grow briskly, but is apparently beginning to encounter some problems. On the positive side, manufacturers report strong orders. Overall mining and forest product output remains high. Agricultural production is at or near record levels. Non-residential construction remains robust. Retail sales of general merchandise are strong and vehicles generally continue to sell well. Fall tourism was excellent as are prospects for winter activities.
However, some problems are emerging. Residential building clearly is slackening. In agriculture, unfavorable prices are limiting farm household and capital spending. Urban labor markets have tightened to a point where many businesses encounter difficulty in securing employees. Reported wage increases are larger and more widespread than earlier in the year. Price hikes for raw materials and intermediate goods are becoming common, and a survey shows increasing expectations that such increases in business costs will eventually be passed along to consumers.
Commercial and heavy construction, however, continues to outpace year-earlier levels, and the number of projects already initiated should ensure that the 1995 season will also be a busy one, according to one industry source. Publicly let contracts in Minnesota and the Dakotas for 1994 through October were 13 percent above 1993 levels.
Livestock prices, particularly for hogs, is where the farmer's shoe is pinching. In early November slaughter hog prices hit the lowest point in more than two decades in current dollars and in constant terms approached 20th century lows set in 1933. Cattle prices are also down substantially, with the greatest impact felt by cow-calf operators in Montana and in western South Dakota.
The upshot of this pattern of good crops but unfavorable prices for both grains and livestock is that farm household and capital spending are expected to be muted this year. Bankers responding to a Minneapolis Fed third quarter survey of agricultural credit conditions indicated that while farmers are generally able to service debt, few are expected to make major capital expenditures. Exceptions are crop-dependent eastern North Dakota, where farm machinery sales are particularly strong. At the other extreme, Montana bankers in areas where no crops are grown have begun to express concern about the ability of less well capitalized ranchers to weather the slump.
Vehicle sales continue to generally be robust, with reports from Wisconsin to Montana of dealers who are unable to get certain popular models. One industry source, however, noted a plateauing in sales of sedans, station wagons and minivans. Pickups and sport utility vehicles continue to sell well.
Tourism and recreation businesses are doing well. South Dakota had an excellent pheasant hunting season with optimal weather conditions and record spending by out-of-state hunters. The warm, late fall delayed ski and snowmobile recreation, but expectations for such winter business are very good. However, Canadian cross-border tourist traffic reportedly is down from previous years.
"Labor shortage raises wages in region," was the headline in one central Wisconsin newspaper, but that headline would accurately characterize wage tendencies in many other areas of the Ninth District. One director from North Dakota described wage increases of 4 percent to 10 percent in manufacturing firms he had contacted. News reports and advisory council members also note that substantial wage increases are becoming more common, One Minnesota manufacturer reportedly raised its starting wages from $6 to $7 per hour to attract needed workers.
Many sources report price increases in raw materials or intermediate goods. Both steel and non-ferrous metals continue to rise in price, as have hardware items. Adhesives and plastic laminate prices have increased by 6 percent to 10 percent in recent months. And a Minneapolis Fed survey of business, people showed a marked increase in expectations that consumer prices would increase at an above-trend rate, compared to responses to the same question six and 12 months earlier.
