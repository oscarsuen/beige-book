Conditions are mixed among service producers. In California and Washington, employment and investment in the health care industry reportedly are being restrained by consolidation and uncertainty about future industry structure. Also, given an uncertain regulatory environment, a major auto and home insurer is modifying earlier plans to expand in Central California. In contrast, the transportation, communications, computer services, and tourism industries generally are operating at high levels and expanding. Sales of software produced in Washington are strong, and respondents expect software sales to be buoyed further by increasing exports. In Utah, hotel occupancy rates are high, and advance reservations for die ski season are strong; several hotels in Salt Lake City plan to expand their capacity.
Efforts to expand capacity were reported for many manufacturing industries. A U.S affiliate of a Japanese television manufacturer is reported to be expanding research, development, and distribution facilities in San Diego, as production at its Tijuana manufacturing plant picks up. In Central California, a major food processing plant is doubling capacity. An air bag manufacturer as reported to be expanding operations in Utah, and a multinational consumer electronics manufacturer is building a large plant in Oregon.
Construction activity is mixed. In Idaho and Utah, a slowdown in residential construction in the last three months is reported to have eased capacity constraints; however, prices of construction materials are reported to be still increasing quickly. In eastern Washington, residential housing investment continues at a relatively high level, but a respondent sees preliminary evidence of a softening in demand. In Southern California, new construction of office properties is almost non-existent, but the industrial real estate picture is reported to be brighter.
