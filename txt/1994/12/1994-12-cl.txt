General Business ConditionsThe District economy continues to expand vigorously, with virtually all sectors and regions reporting favorable trends. Price pressures continue to be felt in raw industrial materials, but these increases are not being reflected at the retail level. Moreover, wage pressures seem surprisingly light given growing indications of capacity constraints, particularly in the industrial sector. The rise in interest rates has had little measurable influence on either lending activity or consumer demand.
Price increases continue to be isolated primarily in the materials industries, such as metals, plastics, chemicals, and paper-related products. Resistance to price increases remains strong at the finished-goods level, however, and industry sources are troubled over narrowing margins. Some labor shortages were noted in specific technical occupations and in some regions, although there are still few reports of any general upward wage pressures. While many firms cited improved hiring plans, most continue to resist adding permanent staff
Mall traffic was reported to be exceptional over the Thanksgiving weekend. Sales were especially strong for discounters and department stores. Although specialty stores, such as apparel outlets, continue to lag the market, their holiday weekend sales were significantly improved. Price discounting was thought to be a contributing factor.
Retail inventories are reported to be conservative, but satisfactory. Shortages were reported in some areas, but retailers expressed little worry about insufficient stocks. Suppliers of furniture and petrochemical-based products are reported to be pressing for price increases, but retailers indicate that competitive pressures are still restraining force. Prices are apparently failing for many apparel goods and are rising only marginally in most other areas. As in the past several District reports, profit margins in the retail area are thin.
Temporary workers are increasingly hard to find this holiday season, and retailers are aggressively competing for qualified part-time workers. Several respondents noted a large number of help-wanted advertisements, and employment of high school students is reportedly on the rise.
Growing parts shortages are being complicated by increasing supplier requests for higher prices. Many parts suppliers have reportedly reached capacity and are unable to meet demand without incurring additional marginal expenses, such as overtime. Prices of raw materials, such as metals and polymers, are also rising, and profit margins in the supply network are compressed.
Automakers are employing a variety of efforts to increase production at existing factories, including three-shift work schedules, capital equipment additions, and production shifts between existing assembly lines. Industry sources agree that these efforts are adding only incrementally to total output, however.
Dealers remain optimistic about 1995 model-year sales and model shortages are expected to ease before spring. Dealer reaction to recent interest-rate increases is focused on their influence on floor-plan costs, although continued rate hikes could reportedly hamper consumer demand.
All of the District sources were concerned about a potential deterioration in loan quality as competition for loans continues to intensify. A few sources have begun to move away from some credit areas due to quality considerations and narrowing margins.
