All respondents raised their prime rate last month, and most expect to raise the rate again in the near term. All banks raised their consumer lending rates last month, and almost all anticipate further increases in the near future. Lending standards were unchanged.
Deposits last month were flat to up at most banks. Most respondents report increases in demand deposits. NOW accounts were constant to up, while large CDs were constant to down. Money market deposit accounts and small time and savings deposits were both mixed, with about equal numbers of respondents reporting increases and decreases.
Large supplies of red meat and poultry are holding down livestock prices and clouding the outlook for district livestock production. Lower feed costs and somewhat stronger fed cattle prices have trimmed losses to near break-even levels in most cattle feedlots. But a sharp decline in feeder cattle prices has pushed down profits on ranches. Meanwhile, low hog prices have triggered the liquidation of hog herds by some small-scale producers. Despite the downturn in livestock earnings, bankers report their farm loan portfolios generally remain in good condition.
