Evidence of greater inflation in retail prices remained relatively scarce. Most retailing contacts continued to stress that price competition remains intense, with little change in overall prices reported even among those retailers experiencing increased labor shortages and higher wages. One large retail chain stated that department stores "seem to be running a little more promotional than people might have expected a few months ago." Another large chain concentrated in apparel stated that price increases have played "no role whatsoever" in same-store sates gains in recent months. "We've had a lot of threats, but very few suppliers have really had the guts to try to put anything through."
