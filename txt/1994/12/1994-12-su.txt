Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest economic activity generally is continuing to expand at about the same pace as in recent months. Retail sales in most districts have improved, with nearly all districts reporting strong sales early in the holiday season. Manufacturing activity is increasing further in most districts, especially in durable goods industries, and the service sector is continuing to show strength. While single-family homebuilding continues to slow across most districts, commercial real estate markets and nonresidential construction have picked up in many districts. Loan demand is up in most districts, led by consumer loans and commercial and industrial lending. Farmers have harvested large crops in most parts of the nation but face generally low prices, as do cattle and hog producers. Energy activity in regions producing oil and natural gas has picked up somewhat. Prices of raw and intermediate materials continue to advance, with reports of some increases being passed through to final product prices. Labor markets in most districts have tightened further and more districts are reporting increasing wages in selected occupations.
A wide range of merchandise apparently has been selling well, with some regional variation. Retailers in the New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City districts report either recently improving sales of apparel or expectations of improving sales during the holidays. In some of these districts the improvement is a rebound from soft sales of seasonal apparel during warm-weather spells in October. Furniture in the Atlanta, Cleveland, and Kansas City districts has been selling well. Seasonal items such as snowblowers and car batteries have been selling well in the Chicago district. Retailers in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts expect strong sales of consumer electronic goods during the holidays. Auto sales have held up well in most regions, except where dealers continue to have difficulties obtaining popular models.
Durable goods industries over the past month have been the strongest performers. The strongest industries in the Boston district were consumer durables and new types of computer equipment. The electronic components industry has been strong in the Dallas and San Francisco districts. Factory activity in the Philadelphia and Cleveland districts has been boosted by increased production of durable goods such as steel, other metal products, and machinery. The Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis districts report strength in the production of automobiles and related products. While the Atlanta and Dallas districts note some slowing of orders for building materials, this industry remains robust in the San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, and Minneapolis districts.
Examples of weak industries are much less common. The aerospace industry continues to damp manufacturing gains in the Boston and San Francisco districts. And, the apparel industry remains weak in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Atlanta districts.
Commercial real estate markets have picked up in many districts. The Boston, New York, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas districts all report robust commercial real estate activity with a surge in sales and construction in most markets. In the Richmond district, activity was steady but commercial vacancy rates declined. In the New York, Atlanta, and Dallas districts, commercial real estate activity has been boosted by tightening markets for office space. Retail and industrial leasing was cited as an additional factor contributing to the strength in the Atlanta and Dallas districts.
The Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts report stronger energy activity, despite weak oil and natural gas prices. In the Minneapolis district, mining and forestry industries continue to boost output in response to strong demand.
Most districts report further tightening of labor markets, but the tightening remains confined to certain sectors. In the Cleveland district, labor shortages are limited to specific technical occupations. Markets for construction workers have been tighter in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City districts. In the Atlanta, Minneapolis and St. Louis districts, retail and food service firms report difficulty in hiring temporary workers for the holiday season due to tight labor markets. In the Dallas district, labor market tightness has surfaced in technical and professional fields.
Labor market tightness has led to rising wages in more districts than reported in the last Beigebook. Districts reporting evidence of rising wages include Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas. Wage increases have generally been confined to skilled construction and industrial occupations and entry-level service and retail occupations. In the Kansas City district, only a few contacts report increased wages, and those increases were limited to skilled construction workers such as carpenters. The Dallas district reports only scattered evidence of wage increases, mostly in temporary-help services, trucking, accounting, and communications. In the Richmond district, wages increased at service-producing firms.
