The First District economy continues its gradual recovery, with manufacturers reporting more widespread gains than retailers. Both sectors face selected price increases. The region's commercial real estate market is moving ahead, but at an uneven pace.
Retailers expect moderate holiday sales growth in New England. The majority anticipate December sales no more than 5 percent higher than a year ago. Inventories are higher than last month, in preparation for the holiday season; however, retailers are planning only modest increases in staff, if any, in December.
Over the next six months, building and hardware contacts expect sales to decline 5 percent, because of higher interest rates. They report 5 to 10 percent increases in the cost of building materials, paint, insulation, and lumber, which they are passing on to customers. Other retail contacts report stable prices, except for cotton and corrugated cardboard. Gross margins and profits vary considerably among retailers. This year's wage increases ranged from 3 to 5 percent. Only one retail contact reports major capital spending plans for 1995.
Contacts note sharp cost increases for paper products, polyethylene, alcohol-based products, and wool; costs have also risen noticeably for a variety of metals, other chemicals, and lumber. About one-half of the manufacturing respondents have raised or intend to raise their prices by between 2 and 6 percent, but makers of machinery and equipment are maintaining or reducing selling prices.
Employment trends over the past year have been mixed, but downsizing efforts appear to be nearing completion, and about one-half of the respondents anticipate making net new hires in the months ahead. Several contacts in New Hampshire and Vermont mention that it is becoming more difficult to hire and retain workers. Wage and salary increases mostly hover around 3 to 4 percent, but are lower for some companies facing weak demand and higher for some highly productive workers.
Most contacts are at least guardedly optimistic about their company's business prospects in the next six to 12 months, citing factors such as momentum in the U.S. economy, prospects for improved exports to Europe, and successful strategies by their firm. A couple indicate that higher interest rates are reducing their company's earnings, and some express longer-term worries about cost pressures or a downturn in consumer spending.
