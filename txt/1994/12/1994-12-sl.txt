District car dealers report mixed sales activity. Some dealers are still experiencing falling sales because of lack of inventory, while others are experiencing double-digit sales increases. Prices of most 1995 models have increased relative to their 1994 counterparts, although some dealers report that these increases are being absorbed in dealer costs rather than being passed on to consumers.
Most District industries surveyed report increased sales in recent months. For example, a maker of concrete products reports that October figures show sales up 30 percent over last year. In addition, this contact reports that demand has not followed the normal seasonal pattern: Strong residential housing demand is keeping demand for building materials unseasonably high. Similarly, a District brick manufacturer currently has one-third of its annual production on back order, which is more than usual, especially for this time of year. A glass container manufacturer reports that October sales were up 8 percent over last year, and a contact in the footwear industry reports a 1.5 percent increase during October but a 15 percent increase year-to-date. A maker of car exhaust systems reports that automakers' just-in-time inventories keep this company operating around the clock to keep up with demand. In general, contacts throughout Arkansas and the Louisville, Memphis and St.
Some contacts, however, are not as positive. A maker of corrugated boxes reports October sales were down 6 percent, although year-to-date sales are still up 10 percent. A contact in northeast Mississippi reports an overall softening in the region's economy; he cites not-so-upbeat reports from computer and office suppliers, who expect some slowing over the next six months, partly because of rising interest rates.
