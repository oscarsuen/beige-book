The First District economy is experiencing moderately vigorous expansion on the strength of retail and manufacturing activity, but housing sales are slowing. Prices of some manufactured goods and new homes are rising, while store prices generally remain flat.
The retail environment generally continues to be promotional. Prices and gross margins remain relatively flat, and inventories are intentionally lean.
Retail contacts anticipate a strong fall and holiday season with growth in sales of 5 to 12 percent. Encouraged by a perceived rise in consumer confidence and new mall developments in the region, some companies are planning increases in employment to staff new stores or expansions of existing stores.
Most respondents indicate some materials cost pressures. Several face substantial price increases for steel and copper as existing contracts with suppliers expire or strong demand forces them to rely on spot markets. Prices for raw wool and some wood species have recently risen by 20 to 30 percent, and paper prices are moving upward. Chemicals prices are reported flat.
About one-half of the manufacturing contacts have raised or plan to raise prices, by up to 5 percent. Remaining selling prices are flat to down, as a result of pressures from automotive customers and competition in industries such as textiles, medical supplies, and computers.
Equal numbers of respondents report that employment has decreased, increased, or held steady over the past year. Three-fourths of the manufacturing sample report modest to heavy use of overtime in recent months. Most contacts report 1994 wage increases of 2 to 4 percent.
Manufacturing respondents generally are fairly optimistic about future growth, although some point to risks associated with particular product markets or the economy at large. One-half plan limited hiring or reductions in the rate of job cutbacks. Manufacturers producing automotive parts, furniture, computer components, and paper goods are adding to capacity.
Although new construction is continuing strong as a result of contracts signed in the spring, a recent slowdown in purchase agreements and price increases due to higher input costs are expected to limit future activity. One Massachusetts builder notes that he has business only through September, and another contact expects that overbuilding will lead to a decline in speculative construction. Renovations and additions are reported to be strong.
Nonbank Financial ServicesThe majority of respondents at insurance companies report a small rise in overall sales in the second quarter compared to a year ago. The largest increases were for variable annuities. Almost all respondents report flat or lower employment for the second quarter and expect a similar trend for the rest of the year.
