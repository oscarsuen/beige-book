Commercial and multifamily real estate contacts continue to report improving conditions in their markets. Multifamily occupancy and rental rates are rising in most areas of the District, and many cities are seeing new multifamily development underway. In addition, commercial realtors are also reporting improved leasing activity and falling vacancy rates. While almost all new commercial construction in the District is either public or build-to-suit, some contacts have noted that they anticipate some speculative building in selected areas within the next year.
