Housing sales and construction have lost some momentum in recent months. An association of homebuilders reported that sales and traffic fell off significantly further than seasonally expected in May and June. Activity is well below expectations held earlier in 1994. One large homebuilder stated that "the initial sales push from fears of higher interest rates seems to have played itself out. The overall impact of higher rates is now negative." Demand from non-discretionary buyers has held up relatively well under rate increases, according to this contact, but May and June results were still characterized as "lousy." and below plan. One of the largest realtors, in the District reported that transactions volume in June was significantly below its year-earlier level; year-to-date in 1994, sales are even with last year, and "the trend isn't good." A large bank reported that housing loan demand has fallen off in recent months.
There are not yet any extraordinary shortages of construction equipment arising from an ongoing strike: some machine types are on allocation, but an industry analyst noted that "this is typical for the industry tight now." Overseas productive capacity is still underutilized for most of the affected manufacturers' product lines. A capital goods manufacturer stated that sales to the paper industry remain relatively weak, even as that industry's operating rate has risen to high levels, because paper manufacturers' profitability has suffered with weak prices due to low capacity utilization levels among overseas manufacturers.
Industrial material prices continued to climb faster than the overall price level. The price component of purchasing managers' surveys in Chicago, Detroit and Western Michigan each rose in June, and have been on upward trends during 1994. Finished steel prices have been heading higher this year on the spot market, while contractual prices with automakers are also expected to rise. After dropping off significantly in March and April, scrap steel prices firmed and rose anew during May and June, and an industry analyst expected further gains in coming months. A large petrochemical firm noted that future supply conditions are highly uncertain (citing output in the former USSR, in particular), and refrained from speculating about the future path of oil prices.
Several regional analysts reported strong gains in help-wanted advertising in their respective market areas, both in print as well as on the radio, with one noting increased advertising by employers based outside the local area where the ads appear. Few manufacturers stated that labor shortages were impacting wages, however, and those who did noted that upward pressures on wages were concentrated in skilled technical positions.
