In the southern parts of the District, building supplies companies report that year-over-year sales are up more than 20 percent; year-to-date sales are up 18 percent. A pallet producer reports year-to-date sales are up 15 percent. Other manufacturers report year-to-date sales increases of between 6 percent and 12 percent.
Firms are recalling laid-off workers and hiring additional workers in all parts of the District. For example, a clothing manufacturer in Arkansas recalled 2,000 laid-off workers and reports that plants are operating at capacity. A jeans manufacturer will soon complete a new facility in Kentucky, employing 350 workers, with potential for 250 additional workers if consolidation plans are realized. Northeast Mississippi is getting a new waste recycling facility, generating about 200 new positions. An aerospace firm is transferring production from Utah to an abandoned Mississippi facility, bringing 850 jobs. A nationally known discount store announced the opening of three supercenters in western Tennessee that will employ 1,800 people. An automaker announced it will continue to build a particular model at its current plant, saving 1,100 jobs.
Some employee layoffs, firm reorganizations and sales declines occurred in the District as well. For example, a maker of medical products closed two divisions and laid off 500 workers, about 125 in St. Louis. Riverboat casinos in the St. Louis area have also laid off workers, partly because of the normal overhiring that occurs when they first open and partly because of the lack of traditional slot machines, which reduces attendance and makes the riverboats less competitive. A shoe manufacturer and a chemical company announced plant closings, together eliminating almost 300 jobs. A southern Illinois mining company is closing a mine and a preparation facility by late August, eliminating 200 jobs, because its major customer, wanting a lower-sulfur coal, will not renew its contract. A vehicle transmission manufacturer reports that year-to-date sales are down 13 percent. A contact in the paper products industry reports that year-over-year sales are down 5 percent; however, demand in this industry usually lags the rest of the economy by about one year.
Commercial real estate markets continue to improve. In Memphis, the office vacancy rate is at a six-year low, and industrial construction is headed toward a 10-year peak. Some District contacts expect multifamily construction, which has been dormant for several years, to pick up in the near future.
