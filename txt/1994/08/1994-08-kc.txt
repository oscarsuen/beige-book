A modest rebound in cattle prices has reduced losses in the district cattle industry. The recent losses in district feedlots, however, have had relatively little impact on district ranchers. Most ranchers plan to sell their cattle in the autumn, when prices are expected to be higher.
District lenders report that most cattle feeders have been able to absorb their recent losses. Some small, under-capitalized feeders have been forced out of business. But most larger feedlots are well capitalized after several recent years of healthy profits. Thus, most lenders have experienced only a slight deterioration in cattle loan portfolios.
