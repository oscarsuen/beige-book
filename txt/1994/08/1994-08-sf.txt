Summer tourism is reported strong in most parts of the District, although the number of visitors is well below last year's level at some national parks in the West. Hotel occupancies are at record levels in Salt Lake City, and at strong levels in Las Vegas and in many coastal and mountain areas of California. In Reno, Nevada, airport passenger traffic has reached record levels. The depreciation of the dollar is expected to boost tourism from Japan and Germany. In fact, the visitor count in Hawaii has risen from its earlier low level, due in part to the higher value of the yen. However, the lower value of the Canadian dollar may reduce the number of "snow geese" traveling south this winter.
Oil prices have rebounded, helping producers in Alaska and California's Central Valley. Prices still are too low to spur increased exploration activity, however. In the Pacific Northwest, wood products orders are reported to have improved. Lumber prices remain low, down 30 percent from three months ago, while pulp and linerboard prices are up.

Construction activity remains strong in much of the District outside of California. In California, both home-building and nonresidential construction activity are above year-earlier levels, but construction activity has slowed since the first three months of 1994. Elsewhere in the District, reports of shortages of skilled construction workers and rising building materials prices are becoming more frequent. In Oregon, materials prices are reported up 10 to 15 percent. Skilled labor shortages in Utah have increased building delays.
