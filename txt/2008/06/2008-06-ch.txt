Economic activity in the  Seventh District expanded in April and May, but at a slower pace than in the  previous reporting period.  Consumer  spending was sluggish, and labor market conditions weakened some, although they  continued to vary by industry and location.   Residential construction showed signs of stabilizing and nonresidential  construction steadily increased.   Manufacturing activity weakened slightly, but business conditions  remained solid.  Consumer lending  declined, while business lending remained strong.  Cost pressures from rising material and  energy prices increased significantly from the previous reporting period, while  wage pressures remained low.  Delays in planting crops led to expectations of small losses in yield.
