Reports from  District contractors indicated that the pace of commercial development was  below that of a year-ago.  The majority  of contacts continued to report that commercial construction declined during  late April and May compared with a year ago.   Order backlogs continued to shrink while material costs continued to  rise.
Fuel and  petrochemical price increases were noted across the District.  Increases in the prices of metals and  agricultural goods were also observed.   There were more reports of these price increases being passed on.  However, notable exceptions were construction  firms, building materials producers, and businesses  that were restricted by existing fixed-price agreements with their  customers.
