The Second District's economy has been generally  weaker since the last report.  Manufacturers  report that business activity remained sluggish in May, while cost pressures  have been increasingly widespread.   Contacts at non-manufacturing firms, in general, report continued  deterioration in business conditions and anticipate little improvement in the  months ahead.  A major employment agency  notes recent weakening in hiring activity and some general slackening in the  labor markets.  Retailers indicate mixed  results for April and May; sales are said to be close to plan on average.
Tourism activity in New York City has shown some signs of softening since  the last report.  Housing markets weakened  further, with sales activity down and prices flat to lower.   New York City's office market continued to soften  in April and May--while leasing activity has remained moderately brisk, vacancy  rates have continued to rise. Finally, bankers report some steadying in loan  demand, further tightening in credit standards, and continued increases in delinquency  rates across all loan categories.
Consumer surveys indicate further deterioration in  confidence: the Conference Board's survey of Middle Atlantic state residents  (NY, NJ, Pa) shows consumer confidence declining for the eighth consecutive  month in May, falling to a nearly 15-year low.   Tourism activity in New York City has shown some signs of softening since  the last report.  While Manhattan's hotel occupancy rate remained  close to 90 percent in April, room rates were up by 7½ percent from a year  earlier, and total revenues were up 6 percent; these are the smallest 12-month  increases in more than two years.  More  recently, Broadway theaters report that both attendance and revenues were down  more than 10 percent from a year ago in April; they recovered somewhat in May  but were still down roughly 3 percent from a year earlier.
Separately, an expert in New Jersey's homebuilding industry notes that  the market for new homes is being hampered by ongoing weakness in the resale  market, where sales activity remains at low levels and prices are down more  than 10 percent from a year ago.   However, builders are reported to have worked through much of their  inventory overhang and are no longer offering aggressive discounts, but they  are still offering concessions.
Commercial real estate markets in the  region have shown further signs of slackening since the last report.  While Manhattan's office market is still  fairly active in terms of leasing activity and renewals, office vacancy rates  continued to rise in May--particularly on Class A properties.  A sizable amount of available space is coming  onto the market, largely from financial firms.   This has bolstered average asking rents, as the mix of available space  has become more weighted toward the high end: asking rents are up roughly 10  percent from a year ago, but this is well below the 20 to 30 percent  appreciation seen in 2007.  The sales  market for office properties is reported to be especially weak, with prices  estimated to be down 15 to 20 percent from a year earlier.  New Jersey's office rental and sales markets  are also reported to be increasingly soft, with a fair amount of new  development said to be in the pipeline.
New    York State  manufacturers report that business activity remained sluggish in May; contacts again  report increasingly widespread hikes in prices paid but only moderate increases  in selling prices.  Non-manufacturing  contacts, in general, report continued widespread weakening in business  conditions and widespread cost pressures but steady employment levels.
