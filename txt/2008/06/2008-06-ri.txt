On balance, economic activity in the Fifth  District edged lower in late April and May.   Retailers reported declining activity in recent weeks, due in part to  higher food and energy prices sapping consumers' available income.  Home sales remained sluggish across most of  the District, and commercial real estate leasing was soft.  In addition, commercial lending eased further  as some lenders tightened credit standards.   Manufacturing activity also slipped, though several contacts noted that  export demand continued to be a bright spot.   Many services providers reported slower revenue growth in recent weeks,  although some resort locations saw increased activity over the Memorial Day  weekend.  Manufacturers and retailers  trimmed payrolls and services firms reported little new hiring activity.  On the price front, contacts reported  generally higher prices in recent weeks.   Manufacturing contacts stated that rising energy and transportation  costs were being passed through to final goods prices.
Export activity at Fifth District ports "stayed  strong" with notable outbound volumes of heavy equipment and full containers  despite a dip in domestic auto shipments.   Import volumes flattened since our last report.  Inbound container ships remained near  capacity, but imports of bulk building materials such as lumber and plywood  continued to slump.  Port officials  reported that rising fuel costs persisted in recent weeks, but not enough to  offset activity "as of yet."
On the  commercial lending front, reports on activity were mixed.  In Charleston, W.Va., and Charlottesville, Va., contacts noted a slight pickup in  activity, while other lenders covering the Carolinas and Virginia reported demand as steady.  A Baltimore, Md., contact noted that "if they can,  clients are holding off on transactions."   Interest rates on commercial loans generally dipped since April.  Lenders in Charlottesville, Va., and Baltimore, Md., however, reported that rates had  edged   higher more recently but were "competitive for qualified clients."  Reports on credit standards revealed modest  tightening at some institutions.
Commercial  real estate market conditions softened further.   Leasing activity generally cooled across the Fifth District in late  April and May.  Contacts in Columbia, S.C., Baltimore, Md., and the Washington D.C., suburbs noted weaker demand for  office space in their markets.  However,  contacts in Raleigh, N.C., and Charleston, W.Va., reported demand as steady.  Leasing activity for retail space "slowed  notably" in Columbia, S.C., and was "sluggish" in Richmond, Va.   Vacancy rates were flat across most of the District, but edged a bit  higher in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area for both office and retail  space.  Rental rates were mostly firm,  although contacts in Baltimore, Md., and Washington, D.C., noted an uptick in concessions  being offered to clients.  Financing  remained a challenge according to contacts in Raleigh, N.C., and Columbia, S.C.   Agents reported little to no new construction, and contacts in  Baltimore, Md., and Washington, D.C., saw projects shelved until "at least next  year."
