Reports from the  Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity remained generally weak  in late April and May.  Three Districts  described economic activity as softer, weaker, or lower, with an additional  four Districts reporting slower, sluggish, or modest economic growth.  The remaining five Districts of Philadelphia,  Cleveland, Atlanta,  St. Louis, and San    Francisco described activity as stable or little  changed in recent weeks.
Consumer spending  slowed since the last report as incomes were pinched by rising energy and food  prices.  Higher energy prices also appeared  to damp domestic tourism.  Reports on  nonfinancial services varied across Districts and industries.  Manufacturing activity was generally soft in  recent weeks, with weak demand for housing-related and some other products but  with increasing demand for exports.   Residential real estate markets remained weak across most Districts.  Commercial real estate conditions varied  across Districts, as did reports on nonresidential construction activity.  Lending activity also varied across Districts  and market segments, though tighter credit standards were reported for most  loan categories.  Districts reporting on  the agriculture and energy sectors noted improved crop conditions and increased  drilling and extraction activity.
Reports of higher  input costs were widespread.   Manufacturing contacts in several Districts noted some ability to pass  along higher costs to customers.   Retailers reported mixed results with respect to raising final goods  prices.  In most Districts, wage  pressures were reported as moderate or limited for all but a few skilled-labor  positions, as hiring activity remained spotty in most Districts.
Reports  on overall sales of automobiles and light trucks were weak, with several  Districts indicating that sales of trucks and SUVs declined.  Although dealers generally struggled to move  vehicles off of their lots, contacts in the Richmond,  Atlanta, and Chicago Districts  reported solid sales of hybrid and other fuel-efficient vehicles.
Tourist activity  varied across Districts.  New    York contacts said that tourist activity had  softened, noting lower attendance at Broadway theaters. San    Francisco reported weaker hotel bookings in Southern   California and in Hawaii,  but record hotel occupancy rates in parts of Alaska.  Higher gasoline prices appeared to weaken  tourism activity in the Chicago District, but increased activity at some  resorts in the Richmond District as families took vacations closer to home.  International visitors boosted tourism  activity in the Atlanta and Dallas  Districts.
In service sector  labor markets, Chicago reported a  slower pace of hiring in recent weeks and Minneapolis  reported that employment in professional services companies decreased from a  year ago and is expected to remain flat over the next year.  Cleveland  and Richmond reported little net  change in services employment, while contacts in the St. Louis District said  that expansion at firms in some services industries will lead to additional  hiring.  Boston  and Dallas noted tight labor  markets for some skilled workers.
Commercial real  estate conditions varied in April and May, with some Districts reporting that  activity had softened.  Leasing activity  eased in Boston, New York,  Philadelphia, Richmond,  and San Francisco.  Minneapolis,  however, reported that market activity was up modestly, while activity was  mixed across the St. Louis District.   Vacancy rates edged higher in Boston, Kansas  City, and San Francisco, as well as  in pockets of the Richmond and St.  Louis Districts.  Absorption was negative  in Boston and in Minneapolis  for both office and manufacturing space.   Overall rents were on the rise in New York,  but were stable or beginning to slip in Boston,  Philadelphia, Richmond,  and Kansas City.  Sales trended downward according to the New    York, Philadelphia,  and Kansas City Districts.
Reports on  nonresidential construction activity were mixed.  Contacts from Chicago  and Minneapolis saw slight  increases in activity.  Philadelphia,  Cleveland, Richmond,  Atlanta, and Dallas,  however, reported easing or weak levels of construction.  A number of Districts--Cleveland,  Richmond, Chicago,  and Dallas--reported that  obtaining financing remained difficult for some projects.
The  New York, Philadelphia,  and Cleveland Districts reported increases in overall delinquencies, with  respondents in New York  indicating a notable rise in late payments for consumer loans.  Credit quality deteriorated further in San    Francisco, but began to stabilize in Chicago and  Dallas.  Contacts in Kansas    City and Dallas  expected loan quality to deteriorate going forward. All Districts reporting on  credit standards noted further tightening for consumer, residential, and  commercial loans.
Business contacts  in most Districts reported moderate or limited wage growth in response to some  loosening of labor market conditions.   Contacts in the Boston, Chicago,   Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts  noted wage pressures for certain skilled labor positions in industries facing  worker shortages.
