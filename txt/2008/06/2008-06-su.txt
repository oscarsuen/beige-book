Activity  in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from the Minneapolis,   Kansas City, Dallas,  and San Francisco Districts.  Cleveland  said that energy producers reported a pickup in oil and gas drilling, and Minneapolis  indicated that robust oil and gas exploration and production continued in their  District.  Kansas    City noted that the number of active drilling rigs  surged since the last survey period and remained well above year-ago levels.  San Francisco  reported that oil and natural gas extraction expanded further in response to  growing demand, but that activity had been constrained slightly by a shortage  of equipment and materials. In contrast, Dallas  noted that high oil and natural gas prices had pushed drilling to the highest  level in 20 years without any shortages of equipment and services to date. Prices  and Wages Business contacts in most  Districts reported increases in input prices since the last report, especially  prices for energy, petroleum derivatives, metals, plastics, chemicals, and  food.  Manufacturing contacts in several  Districts reported some ability to pass along the higher costs to customers and  contacts in the Cleveland District noted that they are considering additional  price increases in the near future if input costs continue to rise.  On the other hand, contacts in the Cleveland,  Atlanta, and Chicago Districts  noted falling or stable prices for certain goods related to the construction  industry.  Retail price reports were  mixed, with contacts in the San Francisco District reporting subdued price  pressures for most products save food and energy-intensive goods.  Contacts in the New York District reported  steady retail prices with somewhat more aggressive discounting.  However, retail contacts in the Richmond  and Kansas City Districts reported higher prices, while retailers in the  Chicago District reported increased pressure to pass along higher food and  energy prices.  Contacts in the Kansas    City and Dallas Districts cited expectations for  higher retail prices in the near future. Business contacts  in most Districts reported moderate or limited wage growth in response to some  loosening of labor market conditions.   Contacts in the Boston, Chicago,   Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts  noted wage pressures for certain skilled labor positions in industries facing  worker shortages.
