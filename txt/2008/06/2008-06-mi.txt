The Ninth District economy grew at  a sluggish pace since the last report. Decreased activity was noted in tourism,  services, residential construction and real estate, and agriculture. Modest  increases in activity were noted in consumer spending, manufacturing, energy,  mining and commercial real estate. Labor markets were  flat overall, while wages increased moderately. Significant price  increases were noted for some metals, food, fertilizer, airline tickets and  fuel.
Overall consumer spending was soft.  A bank director noted that restaurant sales were down  from a year ago. Same-store sales at a major Minneapolis-based retailer are  estimated to be flat in May compared with a year earlier. Recent sales and  traffic at a Minneapolis area mall were  on par with last year's relatively high levels, according to the mall manager. Recent  sales were level to up slightly compared with a year ago at a Montana  mall, while Montana bank directors noted that sales at a variety of retailers  in western Montana were generally  flat. A North   Dakota mall reported that April  sales were up 4 percent compared with a year ago; traffic was strong over  Memorial Day weekend. Traffic from Canada to District retailers near the border continued at a  strong pace; sales of used cars to Canadians have increased substantially. Recent  motor vehicle sales at a South Dakota  dealer were up from a year ago.
Spring  tourism was slow in a number of areas due to cool, wet weather, but officials  were cautiously optimistic for the summer season. Visits to northwestern Wisconsin were down from a year ago, but tourism businesses are  anticipating a solid summer season, according to a chamber of commerce  representative. Tourism activity was slow over Memorial Day weekend due to cold  weather in western South    Dakota. An official  in Montana noted that advanced reservations related to summer travel  were strong. A representative of a Minnesota-based travel agency noted  that corporate travel sales were up, while leisure travel was down from a year  ago.
Activity in the  professional business services sector contracted slightly. Preliminary results  of the Minneapolis Fed's annual survey of professional services companies in  May showed that profits and employment decreased from a year ago and are  expected to remain flat over the next year.Â   Respondents indicated that higher input costs and selling prices are  pervasive across the sector.
Commercial  construction activity increased slightly since the last report. Developers were  preparing to break ground on a 185-acre research complex in Sioux    Falls, S.D., and a number of  new hotels were under construction. Residential construction decreased. Units  permitted for construction in April fell 67 percent from a year earlier in the  Minneapolis-St. Paul area and 37 percent in Sioux Falls.
Commercial real estate was up  modestly. The western portion of the District continued to expand. Mixed  reports were noted in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area as warehouse activity  increased, but recent office and manufacturing absorption was down. Market conditions  for residential real estate continued to deteriorate. April pending sales in  the Minneapolis-St. Paul area were down more than 6 percent. Home prices fell  by almost 4 percent statewide in Wisconsin.
Activity in the energy and mining sectors  increased since the last report. Robust oil and gas exploration and production  continued in the District. A large wind farm expansion was announced in North    Dakota. A dual purpose biodiesel plant is planned in Minnesota.  Exploration, permitting and construction in the mining industry continued at a  solid pace since the last report.
Agricultural conditions weakened  since the last report. Cold, wet conditions delayed planting and development of  corn and soybeans in the eastern part of the District. Meanwhile, drought  conditions were severe in western North Dakota and eastern Montana. The U.S. Department of Agriculture  expects corn, soybean and wheat prices to increase, and milk and hog prices to  fall in 2008. Both farmers and ranchers are concerned about higher input costs  eroding profits.
Labor  markets were flat overall with a number of layoff announcements balanced by  reports of relatively tight employment in some areas. In Minnesota a medical devices producer recently announced plans  to cut 350 jobs and a company that manufactures life vests and water sport  products recently announced plans to close a plant that employs over 100  workers. A producer of computer diskettes will close a North Dakota  plant that employs 390 workers by the end of the year, earlier than originally  planned. The State of Minnesota  reported that the percentage of unemployed workers who ran out of unemployment  benefits without finding a job was higher than a year ago. Recent business was generally slower at a temporary  employment agency in Minnesota compared with a year ago; however, demand to help  companies fill full-time openings for existing positions remained relatively  strong. In contrast, a number of contacts in the Dakotas and Montana  reported difficulty finding qualified workers.
Overall wages increased moderately. Preliminary  results of the Minneapolis Fed's survey of professional services companies indicate  wages and benefits are expected to increase 2.4 percent per worker over the  next 12 months. However, recent total compensation package agreements for  skilled construction workers increased 5 percent in Minnesota.
Significant price increases were  noted for some metals, food, fertilizer, airline tickets and fuel. Prices for  steel and aluminum were up 35 percent and more than 15 percent, respectively,  over a year ago with most of the increase occurring in the past six months. A Montana  bakery noted that flour prices increased 130 percent over the past three  months, which led to a 25-cent to 50-cent increase in the price of a loaf of  bread. Phosphate fertilizer prices were almost twice as high as last year,  according to a bank director. A major Minnesota-based airline raised ticket  prices in   May in response to increased fuel  costs. In  contrast, lumber prices were down more than 10 percent from a year ago.
