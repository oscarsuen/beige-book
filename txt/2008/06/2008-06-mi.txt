Overall wages increased moderately. Preliminary  results of the Minneapolis Fed's survey of professional services companies indicate  wages and benefits are expected to increase 2.4 percent per worker over the  next 12 months. However, recent total compensation package agreements for  skilled construction workers increased 5 percent in Minnesota.
Significant price increases were  noted for some metals, food, fertilizer, airline tickets and fuel. Prices for  steel and aluminum were up 35 percent and more than 15 percent, respectively,  over a year ago with most of the increase occurring in the past six months. A Montana  bakery noted that flour prices increased 130 percent over the past three  months, which led to a 25-cent to 50-cent increase in the price of a loaf of  bread. Phosphate fertilizer prices were almost twice as high as last year,  according to a bank director. A major Minnesota-based airline raised ticket  prices in   May in response to increased fuel  costs. In  contrast, lumber prices were down more than 10 percent from a year ago.
