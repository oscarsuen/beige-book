Business conditions in the Third  District showed signs of stabilizing during May, overall, as some sectors  strengthened slightly and others weakened. Manufacturers, on balance, reported  nearly steady rates of new orders and shipments in May, after decreases in  April. Retailers continued to post lackluster sales results, with many stores  experiencing year-over-year decreases. Sales of motor vehicles continued to  fall. Bank lending has been increasing slowly. Residential real estate sales  and construction activity remained well below the pace of a year ago, although  there has been a slight seasonal increase in home sales. Commercial real estate  leasing and construction activity has diminished in the past few months.  Reports of increases in input costs and output prices were about as common in  May as they were in April. Employers in the District continued to describe wage  increases as moderate.
The outlook among  Third District businesses varies. Manufacturers' forecasts have become more  positive since the last Beige Book. On balance, they expect increases in  shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers generally do not  foresee a significant increase in the sales pace during the summer. Auto  dealers expect sales to weaken further. Bankers anticipate slow expansion in  overall lending. Residential real estate agents and home builders expect sales  to continue to be slow during the next several months despite the recent slight  upturn. Contacts in commercial real estate expect leasing and construction  activity to remain soft until financial conditions improve.
The outlook in the  Third District manufacturing sector has improved since the last Beige Book.  Around one-half of the manufacturers polled in May expect new orders and  shipments to rise during the next six months, and around one-tenth expect  declines. On balance, manufacturers in the District expect their order backlogs  to grow, and they plan to increase working hours.
The outlook among retailers  in the District remains subdued. Most of those surveyed in May see no signs  that consumer spending will strengthen soon, and they do not expect sales to  pick up significantly until consumer confidence is restored. With an uncertain  outlook, many retail companies in the region are postponing expansion plans and  limiting capital improvements.
Auto dealers in the region  generally reported a continuing downward sales trend in May. Although there  were indications that sales of automobiles were increasing, the decline in  sales of light trucks and SUVs has led to a drop in total vehicle sales  compared to a year ago. Dealers in the region expect total vehicle sales to  weaken further during the summer.
Commercial real estate  firms indicated that construction, leasing, and purchase activity have eased  since the winter. Nevertheless, overall office vacancy rates have edged down in  most markets. Rents have remained stable for class A buildings, but have fallen  for class B buildings. Contacts anticipate that sluggish activity will persist  as long as economic conditions remain uncertain or, as one contact phrased it, "until  the next up-tick in the capital markets."
