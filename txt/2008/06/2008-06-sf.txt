Economic activity in the Twelfth District appears to  have changed little during the survey period of late April through the end of May.  Upward price pressures were subdued for most  products but remained severe for food and energy-intensive items, while wage  pressures continued to ease in some sectors.  Retail sales were weak and demand growth  slowed for service providers.   Manufacturing activity held steady or grew slightly on net, while  producers of agricultural and natural resource products saw strong sales.  Housing markets remained exceptionally weak  despite scattered reports of improved sales, and demand for commercial real  estate continued to soften in some areas.   Banks and other financial institutions reported that loan demand was  largely unchanged or fell slightly on net, and credit standards tightened  further.
Upward wage pressures were limited,  with contacts noting only small increases in overall labor costs.  Reports indicated additional easing in wage  pressures in sectors that have seen reduced labor demand, such as construction,  finance, retail, and real estate.   However, wage increases remained rapid for skilled workers in selected  sectors, such as computer services.
Demand growth for service providers slowed  further on net.  Growth continued at a  moderate pace for providers of health-care services.  Demand weakened for providers of advertising  and professional services, although one contact noted that demand for business  enterprise software has "stabilized" after declining in earlier reporting  periods.  Providers of real estate  services, such as title insurance, faced very low levels of activity and  continued to reduce employment counts.  The  tourism industry saw mixed but somewhat weak performance on net. Hotel bookings  and visitor spending were characterized as weaker or declining in Southern   California and also in Hawaii,  where recent airline bankruptcies reportedly have held down visitor counts; in  contrast, hotel occupancy rates in parts of Alaska  have been at record levels.
