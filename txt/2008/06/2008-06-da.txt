Economic expansion in the Eleventh  District continued to soften in late April and May, although activity in  regions dominated by the energy industry remained robust. Businesses with  national sales reported that economic growth in Texas is stronger than in the rest of the  country.
Retail sales growth continued to be  weak, and service sector activity softened. Manufacturing was mixed but  improved some. Construction and real estate activity weakened further. Financial  service firms reported that loan demand is growing faster than deposits. Agricultural  activity improved.
Outside the energy industry, record high  costs are weighing heavily on profits and leading firms to be less optimistic  about the outlook for growth through the end of the year.
These developments are putting upward  pressure on selling prices for many products, and some firms are struggling to  raise selling prices, increase fees or reduce costs to survive. In the near term,  retailers say competitive pressure will remain intense as weaker players go out  of business and liquidate inventory. However, retailers say sizable input cost  increases are projected and are expected to push up selling prices next year. Selling  prices remained soft for most materials used in residential construction because  demand is weak and inventories high.
Overall semiconductor sales have been  flat over the past thirty days. Demand from Europe and Asia remained strong, but U.S. sales have been weak. Demand for  solar technology is hot, but much of the production is occurring overseas.  Semiconductor equipment producers say recent signs of stabilization suggest the  worst of the downturn in this cycle may be over.
Sales of food products were  unchanged, although higher prices have changed the mix of products and  customers. Demand for transportation equipment remained strong, with good sales  to supply the defense, aircraft and energy industries. Improved margins and an  end to the maintenance season have led refiners to ramp up production and  capacity utilization. Chemical production has also increased. Weak domestic  demand has been partly offset by a surge in exports that has created a shipping  logjam. Export demand is strongest for chemicals, such as ethylene, that are domestically  produced with natural gas and have a cost advantage over oil-based production  in other parts of the world.
Automobile  sales weakened slightly and remained below year-ago levels. Inventories have increased  for trucks and SUVs but are very low for fuel-efficient vehicles.
Legal activity continued to be strong,  but the mix of work suggests slower economic activity. Real estate transactions  declined, but there has been an increase in litigation and bankruptcy work. Oil  and gas-related activity also remained brisk. The accounting industry reported  moderate sales.
Rising fuel costs are straining the  transportation industry. Intermodal shipping volumes continued at a level that  is softer than earlier this year and a year ago. Exports have increased but not  enough to offset the substantial decline in imports. Truckers say diesel prices  have become too high to be fully covered by fuel surcharges and, in some  instances, drivers have stopped their trucks or are leaving the industry. A few  manufacturers said a shortage of truckers has caused delayed shipments and  inventory buildup. The rate of contraction in small parcel cargo shipping is  slowing. Demand is stronger for leisure air travel than for business.  International travel is stronger than domestic. Air fares are rising, and some  carriers have reduced capacity in anticipation of reduced travel.
Office  demand slowed, except in areas dominated by the energy industry, such as Houston and Fort Worth. Industrial demand continued to  weaken. Commercial construction levels are still high, but contacts say there  are few new projects being initiated because it is difficult to obtain  financing, particularly for large investments.
Deposit growth has been weaker than desired,  and banks are turning to other sources of liquidity. Contacts reported some  improvement in bank funding in recent weeks, with more access to a broader  maturity range, but said conditions are not yet normal, and funding is  expensive. Respondents indicated that there currently is sufficient liquidity  to finance quality deals, but expressed some concern that this may not continue  into the future.
