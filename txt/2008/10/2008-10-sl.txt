Business conditions in the Eighth District have continued to deteriorate since our previous report.  Manufacturing activity continued to decline, as did activity in the services sector.  Home sales continued to decrease, while activity in commercial construction remained mixed.  Total loans at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks decreased slightly during the three-month period ending in mid-September.
The District's services sector continued to decline in most areas.  Firms in the medical, information, financial, and truck transportation services industries cited weak demand and announced plans to reduce their workforce.  A firm in business support services announced plans to close a facility in the District.  In contrast, a contact in truck transportation services announced plans to expand facilities and hire additional workers.  A contact in health care services announced plans to move executive employees into the District and hire additional workers.  Retailers reported that sales volume remains fairly constant, but that consumers have shifted to lower-priced products.  One major auto dealer will close operations in the District and another dealer filed for bankruptcy.  Auto sales were slightly up from a year ago for some dealers, particularly among those offering customer incentives and rebates.  Small cars continued to sell well, but there was slower demand for trucks and large sport utility vehicles.
Commercial construction activity remained mixed throughout the District.  One of the Memphis area's largest commercial contractors reported a record level of committed projects for 2009.  A contact in central Arkansas whose firm specializes in general commercial construction reported that the firm's backlog has decreased from 12 to 6 months as projects have begun to dry up.  A contact in St. Louis reported that the industrial real estate market is stable and that developers are not overbuilding.  Contacts in Memphis reported that the industrial vacancy rate has remained steady largely because of the lack of new industrial construction so far this year.
