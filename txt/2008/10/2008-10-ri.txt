Business contacts indicated that, on balance, Fifth District economic activity weakened towards the end of August and through September.  Retail sales and manufacturing activity slowed across most of the District while services firms expressed concerns about the future.  One respondent noted reduced credit availability for local retailers. Although export volumes remained strong, activity at District ports cooled a bit as contacts noted some fall off in shipments.  Residential real estate activity continued to be weak in most of the District as national economic and financial uncertainty lowered demand for new mortgage lending.  Commercial lending also cooled as credit standards continued to tighten, and commercial leasing activity was sluggish, although vacancy rates changed little and rents were mostly stable.  Meanwhile, hiring activity contracted across the board.  Some input cost pressures remained for manufacturing firms, but overall wage and price pressures abated across District manufacturing and service-sector businesses.
Activity at Fifth District ports cooled somewhat in September.  Retail imports for the upcoming holiday season were below year-ago-levels at the District's largest container port, and other imports were reported to be "down across the board."  Export volumes remained strong but contacts noted some fall off in shipments, especially for lower end commodities--such as grains and scrap materials--due in part to elevated shipping surcharges.
In commercial lending, recent activity was stable to weaker.  Contacts cited a general "uneasiness" that contributed to "less aggressive lending" practices.  Credit standards continued to tighten--some contacts noted that informal guidelines were becoming policy, more due diligence was being exercised for new borrowers, and collateral requirements had increased.  Reports on credit quality were mixed.  One contact noted improved borrower quality resulting from more intense loan scrutiny, while others observed increased stress on the balance sheets of their business borrowers.  Several lenders reported that credit quality was holding steady, but they were "watching it like a hawk."
Turning to commercial real estate, leasing activity was sluggish across most of the Fifth District, especially in the Washington, D.C., metro area.  Agents in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina reported generally soft markets across all property types, but a contact in West Virginia noted pockets of healthy activity.  A Washington, D.C., agent specializing in Class B office space saw firmer demand--partly from tenants moving down from Class A space.  Vacancy rates were mostly unchanged, although reports indicated an uptick in vacancy for smaller blocks of office and retail space in the D.C. market as some tenants moved to home offices.  Rents were stable across much of the District, but contacts in Washington, D.C., noted some downward pressure.  Sales activity was slow to "non-existent" in Roanoke, Va., Raleigh, N.C., Charlotte, N.C., and Columbia S.C., while commercial property prices were steady.  In recent weeks, new construction was limited to smaller specialty-use properties, and contacts reported hesitancy in their markets as "people are putting the brakes on" deals because "there is so much unknown right now."
