Economic activity in the Twelfth District weakened further during the survey period of September through early October.  Retails sales were very sluggish on net, and demand fell for most categories of services.  Manufacturing activity slowed, but sales continued to grow for agricultural products and natural resources.  Activity in District housing markets generally remained anemic, and demand for commercial real estate weakened further.  Contacts from financial institutions reported a decline in loan demand and credit quality, along with a drop in credit availability.  Upward pressures on prices remained significant overall, due to the delayed influence of past increases in the prices of energy and selected commodities.
Wage pressures eased further as the degree of labor market slack deepened.  Job cuts were reported across a wide range of industries, particularly in the construction, finance, and real estate sectors.  As a result, unemployment rose throughout the District, and contacts noted that wages have been largely flat of late.  The primary exception is worker groups whose skills enable them to use advanced technologies, for whom wage gains remained significant.
Demand for services fell further compared with the previous survey period.  Health-care providers reported declining demand, with some medical centers noting a significant drop in cash collectibles recently.  Sales weakened for providers of advertising, professional, and legal services, idling some workers and reducing capacity utilization.  Activity remained moribund for providers of real estate services such as title insurance.  Contacts noted modest declines in tourist activity in some major tourist destinations in the District, such as Southern California and Las Vegas; the drop was more significant in Hawaii and was accompanied by layoffs there.
