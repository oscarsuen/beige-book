However, elevated costs of fuel, food and utilities continued to strain household budgets. Agriculture and Natural Resources Tropical storms improved agricultural conditions in much of the District. However, extreme drought conditions remained in Georgia and Tennessee. Citrus growers reported concerns over weakening prices because of higher orange juice inventories and weaker consumer demand. Poultry producers noted continued strong foreign demand. However, production growth was reported to have moderated as domestic consumption has slowed. The Sixth District's energy infrastructure, a major source of the country's crude oil imports, production, and refining, was negatively affected by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Although long-term damage to energy infrastructure is expected to be modest, electricity outages and lengthy delays in returning to operations contributed to significant short-term declines in oil production and refining. This led to shortages of gasoline and petrochemicals in some areas of the District.
