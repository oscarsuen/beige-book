Sixth District contacts reported that economic activity weakened further in September.  Banking and business contacts indicated that credit conditions tightened, and businesses reported that their ability to obtain financing had become increasingly difficult.  Labor market conditions weakened further in most sectors, and consumer spending slowed.  Residential real estate contacts noted that sales remained at low levels and construction declined.  The increase in the number of foreclosed properties was putting downward pressure on home prices in some District markets.  Commercial contractors noted lower activity and an increase in project cancellations.  Most manufacturing contacts reported reduced production levels.  Tropical storms improved agricultural conditions in much of the District, but the energy infrastructure suffered damage that curtailed the supply of petroleum and related products to some markets.  By most accounts, cost pressures on businesses eased over the month.
Tourism activity remained mixed in the District.  The region continued to attract international visitors, which helped offset weakness in domestic business and leisure travel.  There were several reports of discounting by hotels and cruise lines.
Most District commercial contractors continued to note declines in activity.  Projects were being postponed or cancelled because of funding constraints and weak economic conditions.  Several contacts noted that the amount of sublease space available rose modestly.  Overall, commercial contractors anticipated that development activity would slow further.
Business contacts noted that price pressures had eased for both raw materials and finished goods.  However, elevated costs of fuel, food and utilities continued to strain household budgets.
The Sixth District's energy infrastructure, a major source of the country's crude oil imports, production, and refining, was negatively affected by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike.  Although long-term damage to energy infrastructure is expected to be modest, electricity outages and lengthy delays in returning to operations contributed to significant short-term declines in oil production and refining.  This led to shortages of gasoline and petrochemicals in some areas of the District.
