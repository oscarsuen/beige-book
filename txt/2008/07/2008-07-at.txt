Sixth District business contacts indicated that overall economic activity weakened from June through mid-July.   Retailers and auto dealers reported that sales were lower than expected.   Tourism-related activity was mixed.  After noting some stabilization in recent months, contacts reported that residential real estate activity declined somewhat in June.  Building contractors indicated that commercial development remained weak and most industrial contacts reported that production and volume of shipments were down from a year earlier.  Banking contacts reported that credit availability remained tight.  Labor markets remained weak.  Further price increases were noted in energy, metals, and agricultural commodities.
Most District commercial contractors continued to note declines in construction activity on a year-over-year basis.   Weakness remained most pronounced in Florida.   Retail development slowed significantly, while vacancy rates among all commercial property types rose in most parts of the District.   Overall, commercial contractors anticipate further softening through the remainder of the year and a weak 2009.
Rapidly rising fuel prices continued to affect regional transportation companies.  Most trucking contacts reported lower net revenues in the first quarter.  Regional rail activity was down in June compared with a year earlier as shipments of automotive and construction materials continued to drop, offsetting gains in coal, minerals, and farm products.  Inter-modal shipments were lower than year-earlier levels.
District firms continued to struggle with higher input costs, especially for energy-related goods and services.  Reports of businesses trying to pass on higher costs to consumers increased, but with only limited success, or with limited expectation of being able to repeat price increases should costs increase further.  According to several business contacts, higher food and gasoline prices were cutting into consumer discretionary spending on other goods and services.
