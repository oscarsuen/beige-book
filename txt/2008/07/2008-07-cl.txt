Staffing firms saw a slight increase in the number of job openings, while the number of job seekers was unchanged.  Job vacancies were greatest in health-care, energy, steel, and chemicals.  Reports of rising input prices, especially for metals and petroleum-based products, were widespread.
Capital spending remains on plan; however, about a third of our respondents said that they expect to cut back on capital projects in the upcoming months.  Credit remains available to qualified applicants.  Almost all of our contacts reported price increases for raw materials, especially metals and petroleum-based products.  In response, three-fourths of them raised their product prices recently.  Looking forward, expectations call for prices to continue rising--especially for commodities.  However, only half of our respondents said that they would consider additional price increases in the near future.  On net, employment at District factories showed a slight uptick, although some hires are on a temporary or contract basis.  Wage pressure is not a major issue at this time.
Most commercial contractors said that business is expanding.  Several mentioned that their companies have strong backlogs and a steady flow of inquiries.  However, builders told us that they are concerned about rising input prices and their ability to maintain current margins and backlogs.  Nevertheless, they do not foresee any dramatic downturn in business.  Several contractors commented that although financing is available, lending standards are becoming tighter.  Contract pricing remains stable outside of rising materials costs, especially for steel, concrete, and petroleum-based products.  Workforce levels remain largely unchanged, and little wage pressure was reported.
