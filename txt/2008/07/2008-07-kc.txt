Economic growth in the Tenth District moderated slightly in June and early July.  Most retailers reported flat, but weaker than expected sales.  Manufacturing activity dipped in the period, but the outlook was relatively positive, given current conditions.  The residential real estate sector remained depressed, but seemed to stabilize.  Commercial real estate saw some improvement, but the outlook was modest.  The energy sector continued to boom and agricultural conditions were generally favorable despite severe storms.  Prices for raw materials, including fuel, continued to increase significantly, and some of these costs were beginning to be passed through to finished products.
