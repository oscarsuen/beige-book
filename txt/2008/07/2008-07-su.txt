Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that the pace of economic activity slowed somewhat since the last report.  Five eastern Districts noted a weakening or softening in their overall economies, while Chicago characterized its economy as sluggish and Kansas City noted a moderation in growth.  St. Louis said activity was stable and San Francisco reported little or no growth.  Cleveland and Minneapolis reported slight increases in economic activity, while Dallas described growth as steady and moderate.
Consumer spending was reported as sluggish or slowing in nearly all Districts, although tax rebate checks boosted sales for some items.  Tourist activity was mixed, with residents in several Districts choosing to vacation closer to home due to high gasoline prices.  The demand for services was also mixed across Districts, with strength in the IT and health care industries offsetting some weakness in other service sectors.  Manufacturing activity declined in many Districts, although demand for exports remained generally high.  Residential real estate markets declined or were still weak across most of the country.  Commercial real estate activity also slowed or remained sluggish in a majority of Districts, although a few Districts noted slight improvement.  In banking, loan growth was generally reported to be restrained, with residential real estate lending and consumer lending showing more weakness than commercial lending.  Districts reporting on agricultural activity said conditions were mixed, based largely on how June precipitation affected them.  Districts reporting on the energy sector said it continued to strengthen.
All reporting Districts characterized overall price pressures as elevated or increasing.  Input prices continued to rise, particularly for fuel, other petroleum-based materials, metals, food, and chemicals.  Retail price inflation varied across the country, with some Districts reporting increases but others noting some stability, at least for the present.  Wage pressures were generally limited in most Districts, as labor market demand was soft except for highly skilled workers and in the energy sector.
Reports on automobile sales were almost uniformly weak across Districts.  Sales were especially poor for large vehicles such as trucks, SUVs, and some minivans.  Indeed, auto dealers in the San Francisco District were increasingly reluctant to accept trade-ins of trucks and SUVs due to a lack of a wholesale market for these vehicles.  Demand for small fuel-efficient and foreign vehicles was reported to be solid or increasing in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts.  Dallas reported that consumers were paying sticker prices for such vehicles, and that they were in short supply.
Tourist activity was mixed across Districts.  Contacts in the Philadelphia and Chicago Districts reported weakness, and San Francisco said travel to Hawaii declined noticeably.  Atlanta also noted increased hotel cancellations and shorter trip durations, although convention business remained strong.  By contrast, tourist activity to mountain areas of the Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts was characterized as stronger, which some contacts attributed in part to more residents vacationing close to home due to high gasoline prices.  New York also reported strong tourism activity in New York City, including for Broadway shows and at Manhattan hotels.
Commercial real estate activity weakened or remained sluggish in a majority of Districts, although Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Kansas City noted some improvement.  Boston characterized sentiment in the sector as "decidedly morose," and industrial markets were especially weak in that District.  Office market conditions in the Richmond District continued to weaken and were "bleak" in the Washington, DC area.  Vacancy rates increased in the Philadelphia and Atlanta Districts, and were up noticeably in both Midtown and Downtown Manhattan, according to contacts in the New York District.  Office rents remained steady in the Philadelphia District, and were little changed in the Boston District after taking concessions into account.  More positively, contacts in the Minneapolis District noted rent increases and positive absorption in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area office market.  Districts reporting on nonresidential construction generally noted sluggishness, which contacts in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts attributed in part to prohibitively high construction costs.  Contractors in the Cleveland District were also worried about cuts but reported strong backlogs and a steady flow of inquiries.  Contacts in many Districts also cited tightened financing as a constraint.  San Francisco noted particularly steep drops in commercial construction in the San Diego area.  Retail space was described as overbuilt in the Boston and Chicago Districts.
Most Districts reported a further tightening of credit standards, especially for residential real estate and construction loans.  Dallas reported that lenders were tightening non-price terms and boosting loan spreads in response to increases in their cost of capital.  Tighter standards for construction loans were reported in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts, and San Francisco indicated that credit standards remained quite restrictive for both residential real estate and construction loans.  Tighter standards for business loans were reported in three Districts, but banks in the Atlanta District were reported to be competing more intensely for business customers with good credit histories.  Kansas City and Boston reported that tightened standards were especially prevalent on commercial real estate loans.
Among the Districts that commented on bank loan quality, some deterioration was reported, including in the Philadelphia, Richmond and San Francisco Districts.  New York reported increased delinquencies on consumer and residential real estate loans, and San Francisco indicated that declines in loan quality were greatest for real estate loans and construction loans.  In the Dallas District, contacts had not yet observed a significant decline in loan quality but expected deterioration in coming months, especially for residential real estate and consumer loans.
Energy activity strengthened further with rising energy prices.  Oil and natural gas drilling remained strong in the Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco Districts, with expectations of further exploration.  In the search for new energy sources, Dallas noted increased drilling activity toward unconventional natural gas sources, and Kansas City cited rising interest in tapping shale oil deposits.  Minneapolis stated that wind farm development continued, although ethanol production slowed with higher corn prices.  Mining activity increased in the Cleveland and Minneapolis Districts.  Cleveland indicated that equipment costs were rising, while the lack of equipment constrained oil and gas production in the Kansas City District.
Most Districts reported labor markets as unchanged or slightly weaker compared with the last survey period, and that wage pressures were generally modest.  Demand for labor remained high for skilled workers in most industries, while several Districts reported widespread weakness in the financial services, auto, and construction industries.  Contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts reported very little upward wage pressures, with the exception of the energy and skilled labor markets.  San Francisco noted some downward movement in wages for construction, finance, real estate, and retail jobs.  But Boston and Dallas said more workers were requesting wage adjustments to supplement cost of living increases.
