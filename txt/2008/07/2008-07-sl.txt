Overall economic activity in the Eighth District has remained stable since our previous report.  Contacts noted increases in the services sector and, except for the auto industry, in manufacturing.  Retail sales reports were mixed.  Auto sales were down in June and the first half of July compared with a year ago.  Home sales continued to decline throughout the District.  Lending at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks increased slightly from early April to mid-June.
The District's services sector continued to expand in most areas.  Several firms in the business support services industries announced plans to expand facilities and hire additional workers. Two new call centers will support a major retail operation and a computer manufacturer.  In contrast, many healthcare services firms announced plans to lay off workers and consolidate operations.  One healthcare service provider announced plans to close its facilities.  Retail contacts expressed some concern heading into the summer months, as consumers make fewer trips and seem more willing to postpone big purchases.  Discount retailers reported an increase in sales while retailers of large durable goods reported weak sales.  Auto sales were down in June and the first half of July compared with the same period last year.  Auto dealers indicated that sales of domestic trucks and minivans were down sharply.
Commercial real estate construction reports were mixed throughout the District.  A contact in western Kentucky reported that commercial construction is relatively strong, while a contact in northeast Arkansas reported that commercial construction is very spotty.  A top regional contracting contact in Memphis was optimistic concerning projects for the remainder of 2008, but a contact in Evansville, Indiana, reported that industrial construction has slowed.
