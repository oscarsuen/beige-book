Economic activity in the Seventh District was sluggish in June.  Consumer spending was mixed and labor market conditions weakened some, although they continued to vary by location.  Residential construction declined further and nonresidential construction showed signs of slowing.  Manufacturing activity weakened slightly.  Consumer lending declined, while business lending was stable.  Cost pressures from rising material and energy prices remained high, while wage pressures continued to be low.  Flooding and cool weather further set back crop conditions in June, although they improved toward the end of the month and in early July.
