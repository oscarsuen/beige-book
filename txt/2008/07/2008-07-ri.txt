The Fifth District economy weakened further in June and early July.  Retail contacts reported generally falling sales, though discounters told us they were seeing increased sales of certain items.  Additionally, residential real estate sales were slower in most markets, as was residential lending activity.  Commercial leasing activity also weakened across most markets, with little new construction expected, while demand for temporary workers was weaker.  Manufacturing activity declined overall, though exports showed further growth since our last report.  In contrast, commercial lending activity was seen as stable, on balance, with mixed reports across markets in the District.  Similarly, we received mixed reports from the services industries, and also mixed reports of tourism activity during the holiday weekend.  Retailers and manufacturers noted further input price increases, but had uneven results passing the additional costs through to their customers.
Fifth District export activity continued at a healthy clip in June and early July.  Port officials reported sustained growth in outbound tonnage, which was "still growing in double digits" at one port.  Import volumes remained steady in recent weeks, although several officials noted slight slowdowns from Northern Europe.  Fuel surcharges continued to rise and respondents believe "they are here to stay."
On the commercial lending front, activity was generally stable.  Loan demand ranged from steady to slightly up across Virginia and the Carolinas, although activity weakened somewhat in the Washington, D.C., and Charleston, W.Va., markets.  Contacts in Washington, D.C., Charlottesville, Va., and Charlotte, N.C., reported further tightening in credit, especially for projects in real estate-related industries.  Credit quality showed signs of deterioration in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and the Carolinas, where lenders reported an uptick in client bankruptcies and weaker financial statements.
Commercial real estate conditions continued to weaken across most of the Fifth District.  Contacts in Washington, D.C., Richmond, Va., Charlotte, N.C., and Columbia, S.C., reported that leasing activity for office space had subsided, with a Greensboro, N.C., agent adding, "things are sluggish for everyone."  Demand for retail space was mixed.  Contacts in Charleston, W.Va., and Raleigh, N.C., noted a slight increase in activity, but conditions were "bleak" in Washington, D.C.  Vacancy rates were mostly firm and rental rates were generally unchanged.  Contacts in the Washington, D.C., and northern Virginia markets, however, reported owners accepting offers lower than asking prices, while office rental rates were up slightly for new space in Raleigh, N.C. No major construction was announced recently, and agents reiterated that clients were having difficulty financing new projects.
