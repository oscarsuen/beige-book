Economic activity in the Twelfth District remained subdued during the survey period of late July through late August.  Upward price pressures eased for food and energy-intensive items, but price inflation remained significant overall, while wage pressures fell further.  Most retailers saw sluggish sales, and demand for services weakened.  Manufacturing activity was mixed across sectors but appeared to expand on net, while demand remained strong for agricultural products and natural resources.  The prolonged slump in District housing markets continued, and demand for commercial real estate remained somewhat weak.  Contacts from financial institutions indicated that loan demand and credit quality slipped a bit further.
Upward wage pressures eased further.  Firms in most sectors have been reducing staff counts through layoffs or attrition, with particularly pronounced drops continuing in the construction, finance, and real estate sectors.  The resulting labor market slack has reduced upward wage pressures in general, with the exception of workers with specialized skills in a few sectors such as resource extraction and information technology.  Several contacts reported upward pressure on overall labor costs due to substantial increases in the costs of health benefits.
Demand for services appeared to decline slightly compared with the previous survey period.  Health-care providers reported a drop in demand, with some medical centers reducing staff counts in part by leaving vacant positions unfilled.  Demand remained soft for providers of professional and legal services and fell further for providers of advertising services.  Conditions remained "dismal" for providers of real estate services such as title insurance, with cumulative employment reductions reportedly in the range of 40 to 50 percent over the course of the ongoing real estate slump.  Tourist activity was flat to down in major tourist destinations such as Southern California and Las Vegas and down significantly in Hawaii, and airlines continued to struggle with reduced travel demand and elevated fuel costs.
