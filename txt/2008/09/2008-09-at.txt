Construction-related firms reported very weak conditions.  A larger proportion of contacts said that higher prices for raw materials and energy were being passed through to customers than in previous reports.  Activity six months from now was expected to be similar to current levels with manufacturers anticipating the price increases for both raw materials and finished goods to moderate.  Vehicle production at District plants weakened in July and August in response to lower consumer demand. Freight demand was weaker than a year earlier, according to contacts.  Regional rail activity was down from year-earlier levels as shipments of automotive and construction materials continued to drop, offsetting some gains in coal, minerals, and farm product shipments.  Inter-modal shipments were also lower than year-earlier levels. Banking and Finance Most banking contacts in the District reported that credit standards remained tight during July and August.  Many District banks adjusted rates upward according to risk, required larger down payments and higher credit scores, lowered loan-to-value requirements, and stipulated that new loan customers open deposit accounts.  Consumer loan demand ranged from being steady to down across the District.  Banks reported that funding remains an issue and retail deposit competition remains strong.  Pricing for CDs is characterized as remaining high. Employment and Prices The majority of business contacts continued to report reductions in hours and workforce in July and August.  Overall, firms were holding wage bills in check.  There were only scattered reports of wage increases, mainly in high-demand professional positions, in markets along the Gulf Coast tied to rebuilding efforts, and in energy-extraction industries. District businesses continued to note higher input prices mostly tied to higher energy costs, although increases in the prices of metals, food and fertilizers were also noted.  Higher fuel prices continued to have a negative effect on the profitability of regional freight and passenger transportation firms.  There were increased instances of businesses passing on higher costs to consumers.  However, there was skepticism about the ability to sustain the rate of pass through in the future because of weakening demand conditions. Agriculture Most District growers affected by poor soil moisture levels benefited from increased precipitation in July and August.  Drought conditions still persisted in many northwestern Georgia counties.  Many District growers continued to report higher costs of fuel and fertilizers.
