Reports from contacts for July and August continued to describe weak levels of economic activity throughout the Sixth District.  Retailers reported that sales were below expectations while inventories were higher than a year earlier.  Both commercial and residential construction activity was weak.  Most manufacturers reported lower production levels along with higher input prices.  District banks continued to note tighter lending standards.  Food, energy, and raw materials prices were elevated, but wage costs were not rising in most parts of the District.
The majority of reports from commercial contractors noted declines in construction activity on a year-over-year basis.  Weakness remained most pronounced in Florida.  Vacancy rates among all commercial property types continued to rise in most parts of the District.  Overall, commercial contractors anticipate development activity will remain restrained at least through the first quarter of 2009.
Freight demand was weaker than a year earlier, according to contacts.  Regional rail activity was down from year-earlier levels as shipments of automotive and construction materials continued to drop, offsetting some gains in coal, minerals, and farm product shipments.  Inter-modal shipments were also lower than year-earlier levels.
District businesses continued to note higher input prices mostly tied to higher energy costs, although increases in the prices of metals, food and fertilizers were also noted.  Higher fuel prices continued to have a negative effect on the profitability of regional freight and passenger transportation firms.  There were increased instances of businesses passing on higher costs to consumers.  However, there was skepticism about the ability to sustain the rate of pass through in the future because of weakening demand conditions.
