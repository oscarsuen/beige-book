The Eleventh District economy expanded modestly in late July and August. Economic conditions were slightly softer than reported in the last survey. Despite weakness in some sectors, businesses with national sales say demand remains better in Texas than elsewhere in the country. Most contacts said higher costs continue to impact profitability. Many expressed concern about the health of the national economy and current financial conditions.
After peaking at an all-time high in mid-July, oil prices retreated in recent weeks but remain elevated compared to a year ago. Oil product prices, such as gasoline, diesel and heating oil, fell in tandem with crude oil. The price of natural gas also declined to its lowest level since February. Natural gas inventories are near their 5-year average but are below the high levels seen last year. Prices for some petrochemicals, including ethylene and propylene fell along with energy prices, but plastics prices held steady and industry contacts noted they remain behind the curve in passing through previous energy increases.
Respondents in high-tech manufacturing report flat to slightly lower sales since the last survey, with most describing the pace of growth as weak to moderate. One contact noted a recent softening of demand in Asia which had previously maintained a strong pace. Inventory levels were mixed. Expectations have diminished. Contacts said they had expected demand to improve in the third quarter but now expect weakness through year-end.
Food product sales remain near year-ago levels and the outlook is positive, despite higher costs for input prices such as corn and milk. Contacts are optimistic about the back-to-school season and expect new snack products to generate demand through the rest of the year. Activity remained steady for specialized transportation equipment, such as ambulances and aircraft parts. Automotive manufacturers said demand continued to fall--particularly for vehicles with low fuel economy--and there are reports of temporary plant shutdowns. Sales of corrugated packaging remained sluggish.
Demand for gasoline, diesel, and other oil products weakened and refiners cut production. Contacts said refining margins fell sharply as the decline in product prices was faster than the decline in crude prices. Contacts reported softer demand for petrochemical products as domestic sales remained weak and exports slowed, partly due to Olympics-related production cutbacks in China and the August vacation period in Europe.
Automobile sales remained weak, and most contacts expect no improvement until early next year.  Inventory levels improved as manufacturers reduced production and dealers cut prices.
Legal firms said bankruptcy and litigation work continued to shore up activity. Transactional work was down overall, although demand from the oil and gas industry remained strong. Real estate-related demand was weak. Contacts in accounting services reported steady, moderate demand.
Elevated fuel costs continue to hamper the transportation services industry. Intermodal cargo volume remained steady, but was well below year-ago levels. Respondents noted international demand has shifted the client composition to favor exporting. Railroad industry contacts said volumes were up slightly for metals, coal and chemicals, although the transportation cost of such materials was of great concern. Airlines continue to be negatively impacted by high jet fuel costs. Despite the recent reprieve in energy prices, airline contacts are maintaining their business models and will go ahead with announced capacity cuts.
Office leasing activity remained positive but the pace was slower. Contacts noted that even as vacancies tick up, an expected decline in office construction should keep market fundamentals balanced.  Overall, commercial construction activity remains relatively strong due to projects currently in the pipeline and elevated public sector construction, although many contacts expect a slowdown next year. Commercial real estate sales activity was subdued as investment capital remained scarce.
Competition for deposits remains high, and contacts continue to pursue other sources of liquidity.  Elevated capital costs continue to pressure lenders to increase interest rate spreads. Loan demand remained soft for automobiles and single-family mortgages but commercial lending was fairly solid. Lending was reportedly strong for new multifamily development.
