Ninth District economic activity was stagnant since the last report. Decreased activity was noted in consumer spending and services, while residential construction and real estate remained slow. Tourism and commercial real estate and construction were mixed. Increases in activity were noted in manufacturing, energy, mining and agriculture. Labor markets loosened somewhat since the last report. Wages increased moderately, while prices for many commodities and energy have decreased since mid July, but remain at relatively high levels.
Tourism activity was mixed. Tourism activity in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was soft in July, but August was fairly strong, according to an official. A tourism official in Montana noted that summer activity is on a par with last year; however, tourists are spending less on souvenirs and retail. The number of visitors stopping at tourism information centers was down during July in South Dakota compared with a year ago, but there was a substantial increase in the number of Canadians and other international travelers. A number of contacts observed that people were vacationing, but staying closer to home to save on fuel costs.
Commercial real estate activity was mixed. A Minneapolis-St. Paul commercial real estate firm reported that so far this year, the industrial market has been strong, while the office market has been mainly flat and retail has worsened. Contacts in other District cities also reported slow demand for retail space. Residential real estate remained slow. Second-quarter home sales in central Minnesota were down 14 percent from a year earlier. The western Montana home market has cooled slightly from last year, but is performing well relative to most other areas. July pending sales in Minneapolis-St. Paul increased 6 percent from a year ago.
Wage increases were moderate. Miners and support staff at a Montana mine approved a four-year contract that includes pay raises of 4 percent annually, similar to the previous contract. However, a Montana bank director noted that in the northwestern part of the state, wage increases for management positions were accelerating.
Prices for many commodities and energy have decreased since mid July, but remain at relatively high levels. Several metal and grain prices, including aluminum, copper, lead, corn and soybeans, decreased significantly. Minnesota gasoline prices were 38 cents per gallon lower in mid-August than in mid-July; however, they were 68 cents higher than a year ago. Some school districts have moved to a four-day week in order to reduce fuel and energy costs. A bank director noted that medical insurance prices increased 7 percent this year, while health care costs to businesses increased only 5 percent due to benefit reductions and product shifts.
