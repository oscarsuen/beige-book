Economic activity in the Fifth District remained weak in late July and August.  Retail sales were soft despite recent tax holidays and rebates; a few auto dealers reported low but nearly steady sales.  Similarly, service sector firms reported mostly sluggish demand with little or no revenue growth, while temporary employment agencies noted mixed conditions.  Residential real estate sales remained weak across most markets, resulting in low home mortgage demand.  Commercial real estate activity was generally softer.  Manufacturing activity declined further amid feeble domestic sales that were not fully offset by increased exports.  Tourism was a bright spot, with contacts in both coastal and mountain resort areas noting increased bookings since our last report.
Exports at Fifth District ports remained substantially above year-ago levels in recent weeks.  Port officials noted particularly strong outbound activity for grains and paper products, although one contact reported a slowdown in automobile exports.  Import levels generally remained steady, although several respondents noted a "big drop" in inbound furniture shipments.  Fuel surcharges stabilized somewhat in late July and August, and one port contact anticipated that "they'll hold for awhile."
Demand for home mortgages across the Fifth District continued to weaken in late July and August.  A Richmond, Va., lender noted that her firm was "feeling a pinch for the first time," while a Charleston, S.C., contact said that loan initiations were down forty percent from the previous month.  However, several contacts attributed a portion of the slowdown to seasonal factors.  Contacts in Richmond, Va., and the Carolinas reported further tightening of credit standards, but a Washington D.C., lender said his institution had generally held standards unchanged, though loan-to-values had been increased "ever so slightly."  Reports on credit quality were mixed.
Commercial loan activity softened a bit in recent weeks as somewhat weaker demand combined with tighter loan standards.  A lender in Charlotte, N.C., described activity as generally "healthy, although moderating in growth," while a Washington, D.C., contact said that activity in his market was "continuing to slow."  Lenders tightened credit standards further and several noted more "laborious" underwriting and stricter adherence to policies and guidelines.  Respondents also reported some deterioration in borrowers' credit quality.  In addition, several contacts said that long-standing customers of some banks were being turned down and were shopping around at other institutions.
Residential real estate agents across the District reported continued weakness in home sales.  In Asheville, N.C., a contact told us that his housing market was very sluggish overall, noting that a lot of people were "on the fence" waiting to see if prices fall any further.  Likewise, a Richmond, Va., agent told us he noticed only a seasonal change in August but was optimistic that September would be a better month for sales with vacations ending.  In Washington, D.C., a contact told us that buyers were looking for specific properties and when they can't find them they wait.  In contrast, a contact in Greensboro, N.C., reported moderate sales activity and was hopeful that business would pick up when a large trucking firm moves its headquarters to the area in the coming months.  Sales held steady in Fairfax, Va., where an agent said that prospective buyers feel the worst is over and prices are as low as they are going to go.  Low-to-middle price houses remained the best sellers across much of the District, with little movement in the upper price range, particularly in parts of the Washington, D.C., market.
Commercial real estate conditions varied across the District.  Leasing activity slowed in Richmond, Va., Columbia, S.C., and the outlying areas of Washington, D.C., picked up slightly in Charleston, W.Va., and Greensboro, N.C., and remained flat in Raleigh, N.C., and Baltimore, Md.  Office vacancy rates were "creeping up" in northern Virginia and Richmond, Va., but were generally unchanged elsewhere.  Agents in Baltimore, Md., Washington, D.C., Richmond, Va., and Raleigh, N.C., reported steady rental rates, but an increase in concessions.  Only a handful of new construction projects were announced in recent weeks, and all were small and/or entirely pre-leased.  While respondents continued to report that obtaining financing from larger banks was challenging, several noted that community banks remained more active in lending.
