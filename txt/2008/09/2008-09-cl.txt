Residential construction remains weak, with no improvement expected going into 2009.

Employment levels were largely unchanged and wage pressures were limited to energy producers.  Staffing firms saw a small increase in the number of job openings and job seekers.  Job vacancies were greatest in health care and high-skilled manufacturing.  Accounts of rising input prices, especially for metals and petroleum-based products, were widespread.  However, we heard a few reports that the rate of increase in commodity prices is moderating.
Capital spending remains on plan, with almost half of our respondents saying that they plan to raise spending in the upcoming months.  Although credit remains available, we heard several accounts of borrowers seeing more stringent terms and higher interest payments.  Most manufacturers reported continuing price increases for raw materials, especially steel, petroleum-based products, and processed food ingredients.  In response, half of them raised their product prices recently.  Looking forward, expectations call for inflationary pressures to continue.  However, only a third of our respondents said that they would consider additional price increases in the near future.  On net, employment levels and wages at District factories have been stable, with little hiring anticipated in the near future.

Contract pricing remains fairly stable, and the rapid rise in steel and fuel prices is beginning to abate.  Workforce levels were largely unchanged, and little wage pressure was reported.
