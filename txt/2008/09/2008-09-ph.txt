Business conditions in the Third District remained soft in August. Manufacturers, on balance, reported nearly steady shipments but a drop in new orders. Retailers posted mixed sales results, with year-over-year increases at some discount stores but decreases at most other types of stores. Motor vehicle sales were about flat during the month but well below the level of a year ago. Bank lending continued to grow slowly. Residential real estate sales and construction activity continued to be sluggish. Commercial real estate leasing and construction activity remained slow. Reports of increases in input costs and output prices were about as prevalent in August as they were in July.
The outlook among Third District businesses is mixed. Manufacturers forecast increases in shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers generally expect consumer demand to be restrained for the balance of the year, and auto dealers expect slow sales to persist into next year. Bankers anticipate slow growth in overall lending. Residential real estate agents and home builders have varying opinions on how much further home sales will fall, although most agree that a rebound is not likely until next year. Contacts in commercial real estate expect leasing and construction activity to remain soft until financial conditions improve.

Auto dealers in the region reported a near steady pace of sales in August but at a level far below sales in August of last year. Many dealerships were being closed or consolidated. Supplies of small cars continued to fall short of demand, according to dealers, but they said overall demand for vehicles was weak and total sales were unlikely to rise much even if the more popular small cars were available. Dealers expect sales to remain slow into next year, and they anticipate more dealerships will close as well.
Commercial real estate firms indicated that construction and leasing activity continued to be very slow in August. Office markets have softened as tenants have reduced their space needs by vacating buildings as leases have expired or by offering currently leased space for subleasing. Commercial agents noted that demand for industrial and retail space has declined recently; however, they indicated that the pace of new development has slowed, helping to limit the increase in vacancies. Although several new construction projects have been announced in the region, no start dates have been set, and as one contact noted, "with tight financing conditions it is likely these projects will not commence construction in the immediate future."
