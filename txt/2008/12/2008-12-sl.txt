Banking and Finance A survey of loan officers showed a decline in overall lending activity in the three months ending in October.  Credit standards for commercial and industrial loans and for commercial real estate loans tightened, while demand for these loans ranged from unchanged to weaker.  Meanwhile, credit standards for consumer loans ranged from tightened somewhat to unchanged, while demand for these loans was also weaker.  Demand for all types of residential mortgage loans was moderately weaker, while credit standards for these loans tightened somewhat. Agriculture and Natural Resources Good weather conditions helped farmers make significant progress with harvesting, which was nearly finished as of mid-November.  Between October and November, yield estimates for crops changed by less than 6 percent except for cotton in Arkansas (which decreased by 10 percent), sorghum in Illinois and cotton in Tennessee (both increasing by about 10 percent).  Most District states were ahead of normal with winter wheat planting, but crop growth was slightly behind normal in most states.  Similar to last year, at least 90 percent of the winter wheat in each state with available data was rated fair or better.
