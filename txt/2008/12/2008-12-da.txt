There was a broad-based weakening of the Eleventh District economy in October and the first half of November. While there were a few exceptions, most businesses reported declines in production and/or new orders.  Both manufacturing and staffing services noted a particularly sharp reduction in activity.  Many contacts reported that they were being impacted by the weakness in the national economy and the crisis in the credit markets.  Almost all respondents voiced concern about the near-term outlook with expectations of improvement ranging from about four to twelve months away.
In mid-November crude oil prices dropped below $50 per barrel from near $90 in early October.  Oil product prices have fallen along with crude oil, as gasoline prices at the pump are down by about 40 percent and diesel is down by 30 percent.   Natural gas prices have held steady at around $6.50 per thousand cubic feet although contacts said that if the winter is mild it is likely that prices will fall.
Construction-related manufacturers reported falling activity due to continued low demand from residential builders and a drop off in demand from commercial construction.  Producers of stone, clay and glass reported that demand fell sharply since the last survey.  Primary and fabricated metal producers report that production has remained relatively flat but that new orders are down significantly.  Many contacts expressed concern that commercial builders no longer have access to credit which will likely reduce demand for construction-related materials well into 2009.
Respondents in high-tech manufacturing report that orders have weakened since that last survey.  Orders from businesses for high-tech machinery and equipment fell sharply.  Demand for consumer products was moderately weaker with some low-end electronics seeing some strength.  Contacts reported that they were surprised by the sudden weakness in demand from businesses in Asia although consumer demand appears to be holding up.  Most respondents reported that inventories were near desired levels, although one respondent noted that they were above desired levels and that they will be paring them down over the next few months.   Respondents expect demand from businesses to continue weak for six to twelve months and consumer demand to improve near the second quarter of 2009.
Paper manufacturers reported continued declines in demand, with corrugated boxes particularly weak. There were several industries that were exceptions to the recent decline in activity.  Food processors reported that demand increased since the last survey.  Demand for emergency services vehicles continues to be strong and aircraft parts contacts anticipate increased orders over the next several months.
Auto dealers report that sales and traffic have dropped further from the low levels six weeks ago.  Most respondents think the market will continue to be very weak at least until mid-2009 and are keeping inventories at a bare minimum.
Airlines report that business demand has declined and future bookings suggest continued weakness over the next several months.  Demand for barge services has slowed and contacts said they expect conditions to weaken further in the months ahead.  Intermodal services and railroads reported decreased volumes.  Railroads said that there were significant declines in shipments of construction-related materials, autos, pulp and paper, petroleum products and chemicals.
Elevated foreclosures and large price incentives from some builders exerted downward pressure on prices.  Home values have held up relatively well in Texas markets, and the recent dips remain modest compared to other parts of the country, say contacts.  Respondents said apartment demand remains relatively solid and rental growth remains positive but slower.
Commercial real estate contacts said leasing activity and investment continue to be hampered by credit conditions. Businesses have abruptly halted leasing and expansion decisions, as they take a wait-and-see approach. The commercial investment market has ground to a halt with lenders unwilling or unable to lend and investors unwilling to take any risk.  On a bright note, contacts noted businesses were acting orderly and pragmatically, just waiting for things to bottom out, and were not behaving in a panic mode.
