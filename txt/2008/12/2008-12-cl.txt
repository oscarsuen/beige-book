Overall economic activity in the Fourth District has weakened markedly since early October.  The downward trend in factory output and steel shipments that began in the middle of the third quarter continued.  Residential construction remains very weak, with no improvement expected during 2009.  Commercial builders told us that inquiries have been falling off, and they anticipate a slowdown in business through at least the first half of next year.  Sales by District retailers were characterized as flat to down, while reports from auto dealers indicate that purchases of new and used cars have dropped.  Business loan volume has been steady to up, while consumer lending activity has weakened.  Energy production is stable.  And freight transport volume declined across most industry sectors.
Reports show a drop in employment levels, primarily in manufacturing, residential construction, and auto dealerships.  Staffing firms reported that job openings were flat to slightly down, with openings concentrated in health care and financial services.  Wage pressures remain contained across all industry sectors.  Almost all respondents affiliated with manufacturing, construction, and energy companies said that raw materials prices were stable or showed a moderate decline.
Capital spending remains on plan; however, two-thirds of our respondents reported that they plan to cut back on capital expenditures during 2009.  Companies with strong balance sheets were successful in renewing credit lines.  However, the agreements contained additional covenants and the cost of credit was higher.  Almost all of our respondents said that the prices they pay for raw materials have declined, some significantly.  Moreover, only one producer raised his prices during the past six weeks, while several reported lowering the prices of their products.  Looking forward, a majority of our contacts expect that cost pressures will continue to subside.  Half of our respondents said they have either laid off employees or intend to do so in the near future.  Further, we heard several reports of companies eliminating overtime or initiating hiring freezes.  Wage pressures are not an issue.
Most commercial builders told us that business started to slow down during the past six weeks, and they expect the decline will continue through at least the first half of 2009.  Several firms attributed the slowdown, in part, to difficulties in financing projects.  Backlogs remain relatively strong, while inquiries have been falling off.  Contractors reported holding their prices steady; however, a few expect some margin contraction in 2009.  Construction materials prices have stabilized.  Workforce levels were largely unchanged, and no wage pressure was reported.
