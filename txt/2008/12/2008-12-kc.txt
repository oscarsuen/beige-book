The Tenth District economy weakened in October and November.  Consumer spending and manufacturing activity declined, and the slowdown in commercial real estate intensified.  Residential real estate activity continued on a downward trend and the energy sector slowed moderately, while agricultural conditions were largely unchanged.  Bankers reported tighter credit standards, lower loan demand, and weaker loan quality.  Most business contacts expressed little optimism about economic activity going forward.  Price pressures eased further with falling energy prices, and wage pressures diminished due to weakness in the labor market.
