Economic activity in the Twelfth District weakened decidedly during the survey period of mid-October through late November.  Upward price pressures eased overall because of declines in the prices of energy and some commodities and widespread discounting in the retail sector.  Most retailers struggled with unusually weak demand on a seasonal basis, and demand for services continued to fall.  Manufacturing activity slowed further.  Agricultural sales generally continued at a brisk pace, but energy providers faced declining demand and falling output prices.  Activity in District housing markets remained weak on net, and demand for commercial real estate continued to erode.  Contacts from financial institutions reported weaker loan demand amidst sharply restricted credit availability and further tightening of lending standards.
Upward pressures on wages have largely disappeared.  Contacts reported job cuts and hiring freezes across a wide range of industries, causing unemployment to rise in most areas.  The few open positions have been attracting large numbers of applicants, thereby alleviating upward wage pressures.  Wage gains have slowed markedly for worker groups who previously had seen rapid growth, notably those skilled in the use of advanced technologies.
Demand for services declined further compared with the previous survey period.  Providers of health-care services reported slower activity and concerns over their ability to issue debt to fund needed capital spending.  Sales continued to weaken for providers of professional services such as advertising, legal services, accounting, and consulting.  Providers of real estate services such as title insurance reported very low levels of activity, with further reductions in some areas.  Travel activity fell in major District destinations:  contacts from Southern California reported a rising incidence of canceled corporate meetings, and tourist visits and spending have dropped sharply in Hawaii.  Restaurants throughout the District have seen their business drop off; some have closed, and more closures are expected in coming months.
