Economic activity in the Fifth District continued to advance at a sluggish pace in late February and March, though there were a few signs of improvement.  Retailers said that consumers continued to rein in their spending. Home sales activity remained weak in most markets and assessments of commercial real estate conditions in the District were generally downbeat.  In addition, commercial lending activity continued to slump, though residential lenders noted that demand for home mortgages edged higher.  Other sectors fared better in recent weeks, however. Activity at Fifth District factories and ports picked up since our last report, spurred by strong overseas demand for U.S. goods.  Additionally, revenue growth at services firms was steady and reports on tourist activity were mostly upbeat.  There was also brighter news from District farms as overall conditions improved and spring planting activity proceeded on schedule.  On the employment front, hiring activity was mixed.  Service providers added workers, while manufacturers and retailers continued to trim payrolls.  Readings on prices also varied as retail and services price growth moderated somewhat, while raw material costs were up sharply.
Assessments of commercial real estate conditions were a bit weaker in recent weeks as additional softness in the northern half of the District overshadowed somewhat positive reports from the Carolinas.  The pace of leasing activity was steady in Raleigh and Charlotte, N.C., while an agent in Richmond Va., remarked that clients were "starting to pull in their horns."  Similarly, a Washington, D.C., contact told us that his area "hasn't seen the normal spring pickup."  Reports on vacancy rates were also mixed.  Realtors in Baltimore, Md., and Charleston, W.Va., reported little to no change, the Columbia, S.C., and Charlotte, N.C., markets saw rates edge lower, while contacts in northern Virginia and Richmond, Va., noted an uptick in vacancies.  Rental rates were flat across the District, though agents in Richmond, Va., and Washington, D.C., said landlords were offering incentives to retain clients.  Reports of new construction activity remained "sparse" as lenders continued to heavily scrutinize proposals.  Agents in Columbia, S.C., and Richmond, Va., noted an increase in the number of deals falling through, while a Charlotte, N.C., contact said, "finding a developer who can close is the trick right now."
