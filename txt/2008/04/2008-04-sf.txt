Economic activity in the Twelfth District appears to have been largely flat on net during the survey period of March through the beginning of April.  Upward pressures on labor costs continued to moderate in some sectors, while upward price pressures were subdued for most products but remained strong for food and energy-intensive items.  Retail sales weakened further and demand growth for services continued to slow.  Manufacturing activity was mixed across sectors but appeared to hold steady on net, while agricultural producers saw solid growth in sales.  Demand for residential real estate remained exceptionally weak, and demand for commercial real estate softened a bit in some areas.  Banking contacts reported that loan demand was largely unchanged or fell slightly on net and credit standards tightened further.
Wage pressures were modest in general, with contacts noting only small increases in overall labor costs.  Upward wage pressures moderated further in sectors that have seen reduced labor demand in recent months, such as construction, retail, finance, and real estate.  However, wage increases remained rapid for engineers and other highly skilled technical workers in selected manufacturing industries, such as aerospace, and in computer and software services.
Demand growth for service providers eased overall.  Growth continued at a moderate pace for providers of health-care services.  However, for providers of real estate services, such as title insurance, activity remained at very low levels and contacts reported significant contractions in employment.  Demand for advertising has been on a downward trend, and contacts in software services reported that sales slowed as businesses scaled back their spending on information technology equipment.  Travel and tourism activity rebounded a bit in Hawaii, with gains in visitor counts and spending evident relative to 12 months earlier.  By contrast, in Southern California, hotel bookings for the spring and summer have been running significantly below their levels from last year, and in Nevada casino revenues recently recorded their slowest growth rate in four years.
