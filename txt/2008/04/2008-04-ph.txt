Business activity in the Third District, on balance, appeared to soften further in March, although some sectors made slight gains. Manufacturers reported declines in new orders and shipments, overall. Retailers generally reported sluggish sales, with many posting year-over-year decreases. Auto sales continued to fall. Bank lending has continued to increase moderately. Residential real estate sales and construction remained well below the pace of a year ago. Commercial construction activity remained slow. Service-sector firms gave mixed reports; some have had modest growth, but others have experienced declining business. Reports of increases in input costs and output prices were about as prevalent in March as they were in February. Wage increases were reported to be moderate.
The outlook among Third District businesses varies. Manufacturers' forecasts have improved somewhat since the last Beige Book. On balance, they expect increases in shipments and orders during the next six months. However, retailers have generally made further downward revisions to their 2008 forecasts, and some are uncertain that sales will turn up before the year comes to a close. Auto dealers expect sales in 2008 to be below those of 2007. Bankers anticipate slow expansion in overall lending but expect further deterioration in credit quality. Residential real estate agents expect sales to continue to be slow through the rest of the year. Contacts in commercial real estate anticipate slower leasing activity and fewer building sales this year compared with last year.
The outlook among retailers in the District is not positive. The early response to spring merchandise, according to a department store chain, "is not looking good." Several store officials said they have made further downward revisions to their sales forecasts for the year, and most are limiting inventories. Many of the retail executives contacted for this report also expressed concern about growing difficulties in financing their operations, noting recent reductions in the availability of both short-term credit and long-term financing.
Auto dealers in the region generally reported a continuing downward sales trend in March. Inventories have increased with the sales slowdown, but dealers have been limiting restocking. Dealers in the region have reduced their forecasts for the year, and the consensus is that sales are unlikely to improve much, if at all, from the current rate.
Banks and other financial institutions continued to report frictions in secondary markets. According to one contact, "liquidity is scarce and trading is difficult" as most institutions are focused on rebuilding capital. In response to retrenchment in secondary markets, some banks in the District have stepped up promotional efforts to gather retail deposits.
Commercial real estate firms indicated that many proposed projects have been put on hold in response to reductions in available financing and pullbacks by prospective tenants. Rents have remained stable, but building prices have come under some downward pressure as investors' interest in commercial real estate has ebbed. Contacts anticipate slower sales, construction, and leasing activity this year than last year, but they expect rental rates to remain fairly stable.
