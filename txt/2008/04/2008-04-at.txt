Sixth District business contacts indicated that overall economic activity weakened in March and early April.  Several retailer and auto dealer contacts noted that sales were moderately lower than a year ago.  However, most tourism industry contacts reported that spending remained positive on balance.  Residential real estate activity continued to be weak, with many areas noting high inventories and price declines.  Commercial development was also below year-ago levels in most areas.  Manufacturing varied by industry, with energy, defense, and aerospace production remaining steady, while automobile and construction-related production declined.  Banking industry contacts continued to report tight lending standards throughout the region.  On balance, labor markets weakened, with contacts in several industries reporting a pull-back in hiring and an increase in layoffs.  Contacts continued to note concern over rising food, energy and raw materials prices.  Drought conditions eased somewhat in March and early April.
District vehicle sales continued to weaken.  Dealers reported disappointing sale volumes in March, despite added incentives for slow-selling trucks and SUVs.  Sluggish consumer demand for new vehicles has resulted in inventory accumulation for both domestic and foreign brands.
Reports on hospitality and tourism indicated continuing strength through March.  New Orleans contacts noted continuing improvement in the city's tourism and convention activity.  Gaming revenues from the Mississippi Gulf Coast resorts also strengthened.  Reports from Florida were also largely positive, with many destinations there benefiting from an increase in international visitors, especially from Europe.
Reports from District contractors indicated that commercial development had weakened.  Nearly half of our contacts reported that commercial construction declined significantly during the first quarter of 2008 compared with a year ago.  Meanwhile, order backlogs continued to shrink throughout much of the District.  Contacts noted a sharp increase in material prices, while labor costs growth held fairly steady.  Expectations for commercial development for the remainder of the year have weakened.
Increases in food and energy-related prices were noted across the District at both the wholesale and retail levels.  Raw materials prices, especially metals, were also accelerating according to several contacts.  The ability of businesses to pass on these higher material costs to their customers varied.
