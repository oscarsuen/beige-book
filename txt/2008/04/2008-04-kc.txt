Economic growth in the Tenth District continued to slow, with gains largely limited to energy- and agriculture-focused regions.  Consumer spending was flat on net since February and manufacturing activity slowed further.  Residential real estate activity remained weak, with some exceptions in energy-producing regions.  Commercial real estate activity also slowed, with reports of recent municipal bond problems potentially reducing the scope of planned projects.  High commodity prices continued to bolster the energy and agricultural sectors.  Labor markets slowed, but continued to show growth.  Reports of wage pressures continued to be lower than last year, but price pressures were reported at many stages of production.
