Economic activity in the Fourth District held steady since mid-February.  In general, factory output was unchanged, though shipments by steel producers and service centers were on the rise.  Production at auto assembly plants increased slightly.  The housing industry remains weak with little expectation of improvement in the near future.  Commercial building contractors reported steady to increasing business and a rise in the number of inquiries.  Sales by District retailers were flat to declining.  Bankers cited a slight improvement in consumer lending and a small drop in business loans.  While there has been some tightening in credit standards, credit is widely available to qualified applicants.  Energy production was stable to increasing.  And the demand for freight transport services was soft.
Employment levels and wages were largely unchanged Districtwide.  However, energy companies reported strong employment growth and some wage pressure.  Staffing firms cited a slight increase in the number of job openings, persons seeking jobs, and placements.  Demand was greatest in health care and professional business services.  A significant rise in commodity-based input prices was reported by manufacturers, commercial contractors, and restaurateurs.
Several contacts noted an increase in exports.  Capital spending remains on plan, with most producers saying that 2008 expenditures will be at or above 2007 levels.  Three contacts told us they plan to increase spending substantially on capacity expansion projects.  Access to credit has not been an issue for manufacturers.  However, a few mentioned that their accounts receivable have been impacted by customers who were negatively affected by tightening credit standards.  Almost all manufacturers reported strong price increases for raw materials, especially metals and thermoplastics.  However, less than a third had raised their prices in response, and only a few contacts plan to raise prices in the near future.  On balance, there was little change in employment levels, and limited hiring is expected in the near future.  Wage pressures are not an issue though many respondents expressed concern about rising health-care costs.
Commercial contractors reported that business has been steady to increasing slightly since our last report and on a year-over-year basis.  Inquiries have picked up and backlogs are at acceptable levels.  Credit was available to all our contacts.  Expectations call for construction activity to remain at current levels or to strengthen.  Most contractors have experienced some increase in the cost of materials, with the price of steel rising sharply.  Workforce levels remain largely unchanged.  Pricing for subcontractor services is competitive.
