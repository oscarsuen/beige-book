Strong oil and gas exploration and production activity was noted by several Districts. Consumer Spending and Tourism Reports indicate that holiday sales were generally disappointing.  Sales in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco Districts were varyingly described as lackluster, weak, below year-ago levels, or mixed.  Kansas City reported that spending was solid, but below expectations.  Sales rose modestly according to Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and St. Louis reports.  Atlanta and New York merchants noted that foreign buyers were a boost to holiday sales.  Overall, the outlook for 2008 among retail merchants was cautious. Most Districts reported that vehicle sales for late 2007 were below year-ago levels.  However, the Minneapolis report noted strong demand from area farmers and Canadians purchasing vehicles across the border.  The Atlanta and Kansas City Districts reported that sluggish vehicle demand has resulted in unexpected inventory accumulation.  However, imports and fuel-efficient vehicles continued to sell well according to the Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas reports.  Atlanta noted that some foreign brands had turned to fleet sales to offset generally weaker retail demand.  Dealers in Philadelphia and Cleveland anticipated that sales in 2008 would be flat to lower than in 2007. Reports on tourism were mostly positive.  The Atlanta District observed that Florida businesses catering to winter visitors experienced increased demand.  The number of visitors from Europe and Canada were especially strong, and bookings for the Spring were robust.

However, according to most Districts, conditions in manufacturing industries producing construction and home-related goods remained weak.

Atlanta indicated that Gulf Coast crude inventories were low, but new offshore platforms should help boost production in 2008. Prices and Wages According to most reports, businesses continued to face rising costs for food, petrochemicals, metals, and energy-related inputs.  Several Districts noted that transportation costs for most products increased.  Philadelphia reported that some firms had raised output prices in order to cover higher energy costs.  In the San Francisco District, price inflation was said to be limited in general, but significant for food and energy.  Dallas reported that high or rising input costs were squeezing margins for most industries.  Manufacturers in the New York District reported prices paid and received had increased and that this was expected to continue.  Atlanta noted that input costs continued to increase for imported goods originating in Europe or Japan because of the lower value of the dollar.  In contrast, producers of framing lumber, wallboard, and wood panels reported weak prices according to the Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Chicago reports.
