Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity increased modestly during the survey period of mid-November through December, but at a slower pace compared with the previous survey period.  Among Districts, seven reported a slight increase in activity, two reported mixed conditions, and activity in three Districts was described as slowing.
Most reports on retail activity indicated subdued holiday spending and further weakness in auto sales. However, most reports on tourism spending were positive. Residential real estate conditions continued to be quite weak in all Districts.  Reports on commercial real estate activity varied, with some reports noting signs of softening demand. Manufacturing reports varied across industries, with pronounced weakness noted in housing-related industries as well as the automobile industry.  Strong export orders and increased demand in industries whose products compete against imports was reported by some Districts.  Demand for nonfinancial services remained generally positive, although some Districts commented on continuing weak demand for transportation services.
Reports from banks and other financial institutions noted further declines in residential real estate lending, and lending to the commercial real estate sector was generally described as mixed.  Some Districts reported lower consumer loan volumes, whereas the volume of commercial and industrial lending varied.  Most Districts cited tighter credit standards.
Demand continued to decline for construction workers and those in housing-related industries, according to most reports, while demand generally held steady for skilled workers in nonfinancial service industries. Wage increases remained moderate overall.  Increases in prices for food, petrochemicals, metals, and energy-related inputs continued to be widely reported, and production and delivery costs for many products increased because of higher fuel prices. Producers in the agricultural sector reported generally strong demand and favorable production conditions outside of the drought-stricken areas in the Southeast.  Strong oil and gas exploration and production activity was noted by several Districts.
Most Districts reported that vehicle sales for late 2007 were below year-ago levels.  However, the Minneapolis report noted strong demand from area farmers and Canadians purchasing vehicles across the border.  The Atlanta and Kansas City Districts reported that sluggish vehicle demand has resulted in unexpected inventory accumulation.  However, imports and fuel-efficient vehicles continued to sell well according to the Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas reports.  Atlanta noted that some foreign brands had turned to fleet sales to offset generally weaker retail demand.  Dealers in Philadelphia and Cleveland anticipated that sales in 2008 would be flat to lower than in 2007.
Reports on tourism were mostly positive.  The Atlanta District observed that Florida businesses catering to winter visitors experienced increased demand.  The number of visitors from Europe and Canada were especially strong, and bookings for the Spring were robust. Minneapolis reported that solid snowfall in many parts of the District helped spur winter tourism activity.  Richmond?s assessment of tourist activity was also generally upbeat. Tourism activity in New York City was said to have remained strong through year-end.
Demand for transportation services was generally weak, led by lower demand from the housing sector.  Reports indicated that freight volume continued to weaken in the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts and was slow overall in the Dallas District.  Inter-modal transportation volumes were also said to be lower in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, although Dallas noted that rail shipments were up, led by strong agricultural shipments.
Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and Atlanta reported that many firms were expanding export activity.  In some cases, demand was also said to have increased as a result of import substitution.  For example, Chicago reported that domestic steel production was expanding, led by a moderation in imports.  Demand for equipment used in energy extraction and mining continued to be robust as well.
However, according to most Districts, conditions in manufacturing industries producing construction and home-related goods remained weak.  Richmond noted weakness in demand for electronics, and San Francisco described production of industrial equipment as tepid.  In addition, auto-related production was soft according to the Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis reports.
Reports on commercial real estate activity varied, with some Districts noting that activity had eased late in the year.  Contacts in the Atlanta and Boston Districts indicated that commercial markets were little changed while the Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and Richmond reports suggested slower growth.  Activity was stable to increasing according to the Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco reports.  Vacancy rates were described as stable in the New York, Philadelphia, and Kansas City Districts, and as varied in the Richmond District.  Chicago and Minneapolis contacts noted that retail vacancies had risen.  Kansas City contacts reported that leasing activity was stable, whereas leasing activity in the Richmond, Philadelphia, and New York Districts had slowed.  Most Boston District contacts reported that rents were flat, while rents were steady to declining according to the Chicago and Kansas City reports.  New York and Richmond noted that rental rates had stabilized in the fourth quarter, whereas Dallas continued to report rising rental rates.
Contacts in the Boston and Chicago Districts indicated that commercial construction activity was slowing.  Developers in the Atlanta and Richmond Districts reported smaller backlogs of projects while Cleveland District contacts said that backlogs had risen.  Most contacts anticipate a slower pace of commercial development during 2008.
Activity in the energy sector increased according to the Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts.  Dallas noted a sharp rise in the Texas rig count while Kansas City cited strong drilling activity in Oklahoma and Colorado.  However, seasonal factors dampened drilling activity in the Cleveland District, and reports on coal production in the region were mixed. Atlanta indicated that Gulf Coast crude inventories were low, but new offshore platforms should help boost production in 2008.
Reports suggest that labor markets remained relatively tight overall, and especially for skilled workers, whereas housing-related industries continued to trim payrolls.  Increases in employment costs were generally described as moderate.  Kansas City reported that overall wage pressures eased, with only the energy sector citing significant wage pressure. Philadelphia reported that labor costs continued to increase at a moderate pace while Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco reported that wage pressures remained limited outside of a few sectors that continue to experience shortages of skilled labor.  Wage pressures were not significant according to the Cleveland report.
