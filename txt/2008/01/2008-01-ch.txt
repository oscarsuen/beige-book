On balance, labor market conditions softened slightly, though they continued to vary by industry and location.  Residential construction continued to decline, and nonresidential construction showed signs of slowing.  Modest expansion continued in manufacturing, with export-oriented businesses continuing to do very well. Credit standards tightened further, but business lending remained strong.  Material cost pressures increased from the previous period, while wage pressures declined.
