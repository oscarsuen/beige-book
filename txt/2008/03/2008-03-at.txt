Residential real estate activity remained quite weak, although homebuilders commented that new home inventories were marginally lower.  According to Realtors, inventories of existing homes for sale continued to increase.  Commercial real estate development was described as having slowed in January and February.  Manufacturing performance varied by industry, and domestic freight traffic remained generally sluggish.

In addition, some temporary staffing industry contacts reported a decline in orders and an increase in worker applications.  Contacts noted that rising food and energy prices, along with increases in health insurance premiums, were major concerns.
Tourism-related spending remained generally positive in January and early February.  However, one contact noted that bookings for the spring season were down nearly 20 percent from year-ago levels, and some reports indicated that business-related travel had slowed and was lagging year-ago levels.  Also, several hotel contacts expected lower occupancy rates and more conservative spending by guests in the near-term as a result of higher food and energy costs.
Reports from District contractors indicated that commercial development during January and early February was flat to slightly down on a year-over-year basis.  Most contacts indicated that they anticipate a further decline in activity over the next several months.
The lower value of the dollar was said to be supporting exports by District manufacturers, and was also boosting foreign industrial investment in the District.  However, freight companies continued to report lackluster domestic demand.  Several regional trucking companies cut back operations as a result.
Food, petrochemical, and energy-related costs continued to escalate, according to most reports.  Increased energy and raw material costs were noted by most manufacturing contacts, but their ability to pass on the higher costs varied.  Some specialty-food industry contacts said that recent price increases led some customers to switch to lower price brands.
