Growth in the Tenth District economy slowed to a very modest pace in late January and February.  Consumer spending was flat, and manufacturing activity was sluggish.  Residential real estate activity remained weak but stable, while commercial real estate activity eased somewhat.  The energy sector continued to post solid gains, however, and agricultural investment continued to rise.  Labor markets also expanded modestly.  Most firms indicated few wage pressures, but overall price pressures increased, driven by rising commodity input costs.
