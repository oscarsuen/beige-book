However, contacts expressed concern about the effects of the housing sector slowdown on future manufacturing growth.

Contacts in the electrical equipment manufacturing industry reported plans to expand existing facilities and operations.  In contrast, contacts in the nonmetallic mineral product, plastics product, and transportation equipment manufacturing industries reported plans to lay off workers and decrease operations.  A firm in machinery manufacturing announced that it will close a plant and lay off workers.  Contacts in fabricated metal product manufacturing reported mixed conditions. The District's services sector has shown signs of softening since our previous report.  Contacts in the heath care and educational services industries reported plans to lay off workers.

In Memphis, downtown office vacancy rates increased while suburban office vacancy rates declined.

Banking and Finance A survey of senior loan officers at a sample of District banks showed a moderate decrease in overall lending activity during the fourth quarter of 2007.  During this period, credit standards for commercial and industrial loans ranged from unchanged to somewhat tightened, while demand for these loans ranged from unchanged to moderately weaker.  Credit standards for commercial real estate loans were tightened, while demand for these loans was moderately weaker.

Credit standards for residential mortgage loans were tightened, while demand for these loans ranged from about the same to moderately weaker. Agriculture and Natural Resources The total value of all field crops in the District states rose by 36 percent from 2006 to 2007.  Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Mississippi, and Missouri farmers saw increases of at least 30 percent, while Kentucky farmers saw no change.  In contrast, the total crop value in Tennessee declined by 14 percent over the same period.  Value gains reflected mostly increased prices for all major District crops, especially corn, soybeans, winter wheat, and sorghum (for which prices rose by at least 30 percent), whereas total production increased only for corn and sorghum.
