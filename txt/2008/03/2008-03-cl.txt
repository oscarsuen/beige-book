Economic activity in the Fourth District has slowed somewhat since early January.  Overall, factory output was flat though shipments by steel producers and service centers rose.  Production at auto assembly plants increased.  The housing industry remains weak with little expectation of improvement in the near future.  Nonresidential builders reported business was steady to increasing.  Sales by District retailers weakened and fell below plan.  Bankers cited a pickup in business lending while consumer loan demand was flat to declining.  Further, deterioration in credit quality and a small rise in delinquencies were indicated.  Energy production was steady to increasing.  Truck freight volume slowed.
Employment levels across the District were largely unchanged, though workforce levels fell at a number of national banks and trucking companies.  Staffing firms reported a modest increase in the number of job openings while the number of job seekers was unchanged.  Demand was greatest in nursing and allied health professions.  Apart from energy producers, little upward pressure on wages was noted.  Almost all manufacturers cited increased costs for raw materials while homebuilders and nonresidential contractors noted rising metal prices.
Reports on capacity utilization were mixed.  Capital spending remains on plan with most producers saying that spending in 2008 will be at or slightly above 2007 levels.  However, four of our contacts told us they plan to dramatically increase spending on new buildings and equipment.  Almost all of our respondents reported increasing prices for raw materials, especially metals.  Further, half of them told us that they have either raised prices or added surcharges since our last report.  However, only a few contacts said they plan to raise prices in the near future.  Most manufacturers also expect modest inflationary pressures to continue.  On balance, there was little change in employment levels and limited hiring is expected in the near future.  Minimal wage pressure was reported.
Almost all commercial contractors reported that business has been steady to slightly increasing since our last report and on a year-over-year basis.  Current backlogs are at acceptable levels.  Expectations for 2008 suggest that building activity will equal that seen in 2007.  We heard some reports that residential contractors are beginning to move into the commercial sector, resulting in a more competitive bidding process.  With the exception of a rise in steel prices, material costs have been stable.  On net, workforce levels remain largely unchanged; however, a few builders said they may add workers in the second half of 2008.  Little upward pressure on wages was reported.
