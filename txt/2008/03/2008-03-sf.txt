Economic activity in the Twelfth District appears to have grown modestly during the survey period of early January through late February.  Upward price pressures remained strong for food and energy but were limited for other products, and scattered reports pointed to slight easing in upward pressures on labor costs.  Contacts reported weak sales of retail goods and slower demand growth for various categories of services.  Manufacturing activity was mixed across sectors but appears to have expanded slightly on net, while agricultural producers saw continued solid growth in sales.  Demand for residential real estate remained exceptionally weak, and demand for commercial real estate eased a bit further.  Banking contacts reported that loan demand was little changed, while credit standards tightened further.
Wage increases were moderate on net, with numerical reports generally in the range of 2 to 4 percent on an annual basis.  Contacts provided scattered reports of reductions in upward wage pressures for sectors in which labor demand has eased of late, such as construction, retail, and finance.  However, selected categories of skilled technical labor remained in short supply in some areas, and workers in these categories continued to receive large wage increases.
Conditions weakened slightly for service providers.  Utilization of health-care services continued to grow but at a slower pace than in prior months.  Activity remained very low for providers of real estate services such as title insurance, and weakness in the real estate sector reportedly has held down demand for legal services in some areas.  Travel and tourism activity fell a bit further from earlier high levels in Hawaii; however, tourist activity remained largely stable in the coastal areas of California, due in part to continued growth in foreign tourism spurred by the lower exchange value of the U.S. dollar.
