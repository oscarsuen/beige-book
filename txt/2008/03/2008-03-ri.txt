Business contacts suggested that the Fifth District economy lost some additional momentum in late January and early February.  District retailers reported that consumer spending continued to soften in recent weeks, while production activity at District factories slowed further.  In addition, commercial lending activity moderated and demand for home mortgages remained weak, though contacts said increased refinancing activity provided somewhat of a boost.  Assessments of District real estate markets were also downbeat - home sales continued to languish and commercial leasing activity cooled in several major markets.  Feedback from other sectors was more encouraging, however.  Tourist activity remained a bright spot and revenue growth at District service providers firmed in February.  Port activity was mixed with increases in exports, but sharp declines in import volumes.  On the employment front, labor market conditions in the District deteriorated a bit since our last report.  Retailers and manufacturers cut jobs, services hiring was flat, and demand for temporary workers softened.  Price pressures were elevated in recent weeks behind faster growth in raw material and energy prices.
Assessments of commercial real estate conditions were mixed in recent weeks.  Conditions were notably weaker along the I-95 corridor between Richmond, Va., and Baltimore, Md., while reports from the Carolinas were generally upbeat.  Contacts in the Washington, D.C., area said the pace of office leasing had "slowed to a crawl" in late January and February.  In addition, agents reported that some recently completed office buildings along northern Virginia's Dulles corridor were not attracting tenants.  On the other hand, contacts in Columbia, S.C., and in Raleigh, N.C., described demand for office space as "steady."  Office vacancies edged higher in Baltimore, Md., and in Washington, D.C., but were "fairly stable" in the Carolinas.  It was a similar story with rental rates.  Rents were mostly firm in the southern half of the District, while a contact in the northern Virginia suburbs reported downward pressure on office and retail rents, and said he was advising clients "to take what they can get."  Contacts reported little to no new construction activity, and agents in Richmond, Va., and in Washington, D.C., told us that several national retailers had recently decided to delay new projects in those markets.
