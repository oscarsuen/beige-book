Most of the respondents report-total deposits were unchanged last month, but changes varied among different types of deposits. Demand deposits declined slightly while MMDAs increased. Large CDs, small time and savings deposits, NOW accounts, IRAs, and Keough accounts held steady.
None of the respondent banks changed their prime rate last month, and only one bank expects to lower its prime rate in the near future. A few respondents increased their consumer lending rates slightly, but most respondents expect no further change in the near term. None of the banks report a change in lending standards.
The rise in crop prices has also pushed up feed costs, worsening the profit outlook for the district cattle industry. With continued large supplies of beef and other meats in prospect, fed-cattle prices are not expected to rise much above break-even levels in the months ahead. As a result, cattle feeders are paying less for young cattle entering their feedlots, pushing down incomes for district cattle ranchers. Despite the recent surge in crop prices, disappointing crops and weak profits in the cattle industry point to little, if any, improvement in district farm incomes in 1995 following last year's sharp decline.
