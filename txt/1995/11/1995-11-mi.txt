"Suburban office and warehouse building remains very strong," says a Minnesota director, "but retail building has passed its peak." Commercial building is described as strong in most other urban areas of the district with the exception of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Publicly-let construction projects in the Dakotas and Minnesota continue slightly above 1994 levels.
Iron ore mining continues to have a good season with shipments generally running ahead of 1994. Existing copper mines in Montana and Wisconsin are running at capacity, and a large mining firm is advancing in permitting a new mine southeast of Eau Claire. Lumber and building board producers report sales down somewhat for the year-to-date compared to 1994, but note late summer improvement. High paper prices continue to fuel strong output.
While 1995 yields are below 1994's record levels for most crops, harvests are much better than expected in late spring or even midsummer, especially for corn, durum wheat, sunflowers, and soybeans in most areas. Prices for all the grains are well above year-ago levels. One concern is that rail and barge capacity is lagging output and localized shortages of storage are appearing.
Higher hog prices have cheered producers from a year ago when inflation adjusted prices reached historic lows. While increased feed costs continue to crimp profits, prices in the high $40 per cwt. range mean that most producers are at least recovering all costs. This increase in prices is apparently due largely to increased exports rather than changes in domestic demand or in output. Cattle producers, particularly those with breeding herds, continue to experience severely adverse prices. While well-capitalized producers who experienced favorable prices earlier in the decade should be able to weather the cycle trough, bankers in ranching areas expressed concern about recent entrants and highly leveraged operators.
The Ninth District third quarter survey of agricultural credit conditions showed a 10 to 40 basis point reduction in various categories of farm interest rates and adequate supplies of loanable funds. Most bankers noted increases in observed farm income and spending, which are confirmed by implement manufacturers' reports of good sales. But bankers in ranching areas report large increases in the proportion of their borrowers up against their credit limits.
Auto dealers continue to ride a roller coaster, with highly variable sales generally running somewhat below 1994 levels. But there are areas of strength, North Dakota dealers report good sales of pickups resulting from oil sector activity and improved earnings for farmers.
Reported increases in compensation levels are generally modest. One construction equipment manufacturer in North Dakota signed a 4-year contract with its union providing for a 3 percent per year increase in wages and another concluded an agreement for 1996 with no increase in wages. But some firms apparently are increasing benefits to attract and keep employees. An employee benefit plan firm reports a sharp increase in the number of restaurants and fast-food franchisees who are offering insurance packages and 401k plans.
Agricultural commodities have risen in price, and non-ferrous metals and paper remain high. But price declines are reported for a number of intermediate goods including most grades of steel and particle board. Declines are also reported for property and casualty insurance premiums, technology products, advertising specialties, and some trucking rates. Petroleum product prices continue to decline, and gasoline is advertised at less than $1 per gallon for the first time in years at some Minneapolis-St. Paul gas stations.
