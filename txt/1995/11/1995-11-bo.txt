Expansion continues at a lackluster pace in the First District. Although most retailers report sales declines from a year earlier, tourism is up. while some manufacturers continue to experience steady growth, half the manufacturers contacted have seen sales weaken in recent months. Commercial real estate in New England is sluggish, and the insurance industry reports mixed results.
Most vendor prices remain stable; however, promotional pressures are eating away at gross margins and profits. The New England retail landscape continues to shift as several off-price retailers disappear or reorganize under the protection of Chapter 11. Only one contact plans significant increases in capital budget and employment levels in the coming year.
By contrast, the region's tourist industry reports significant gains in September and October compared to the previous fall's strong performance. Earlier concerns of potentially disappointing foliage did not materialize and several state tourist offices report a rise in hotel and motel occupancy rates, attraction attendance, and general tourist traffic.
Many manufacturers report some softening of prices that had sharply escalated earlier in the year, including paper and packaging, metals, plastics, cotton, and synthetic fibers. Finished goods prices generally are increasing only 1 to 4 percent at annual rates, with higher inflation for paper products. Contacts selling to the aircraft, automotive, and apparel industries are experiencing a squeeze on profits as a result of their limited scope to raise prices.
Just over half the contacts report that their employment is little changed from a year ago; most of the remaining manufacturers have cut their work forces. Typical 1995 wage and salary increases are in the range of 2 to 4 percent, with higher increases for some high technology employees or in tight labor markets. About one-third of the contacts are contemplating a wage freeze and/or employment cutbacks in 1996. Most respondents report heavy capital expenditures this year, but one-third are now cutting back because of budgetary constraints.
Manufacturers expect modest growth in the U.S. economy in the next year. Some are optimistic about their own company's prospects based on export opportunities or a recovery for their industry, while others are concerned about having to reduce costs or reorient their mix of products.
