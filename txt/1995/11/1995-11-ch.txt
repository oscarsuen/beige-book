Signs of slowing have arisen within the District's capital goods sector, notably among producers of construction equipment and heavy-duty trucks. A construction equipment industry analyst stated that retail sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be flat to down slightly from last year, as an uptick in activity in August doesn't seem to have followed through into September and October. Sales remain at high levels, and recent strengthening in housing activity is still expected to boost construction equipment sales by the second quarter of 1996. Nonetheless, this analyst characterized manufacturers' current inventory as "high for all types of machinery." Another analyst reported that heavy-duty truck order cancellations have risen sharply in recent months. Order backlogs have declined considerably, albeit from dramatically high levels. Even so, current production schedules imply a small decline in heavy-duty truck output in the fourth quarter, and another trucking industry observer estimated that fleet utilization slipped further in the third quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis. A large manufacturer of locomotives also reported slower new orders in recent months.
