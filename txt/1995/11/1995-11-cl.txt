Low rates of unemployment, among other employment indicators, suggest that District labor markets continue to be somewhat tight. Labor shortages are being reported in many areas and job categories, including construction workers, nurses, engineers, and some business service occupations. At a recent meeting of District small businesses, several employers noted difficulty in retaining skilled workers and indicated that training costs were increasing as workers moved into more skilled job classifications. These costs are seen as a large and growing component of noncompensation labor costs in the region. Employers note that the migration of workers into skilled positions is pushing up wages for unskilled workers, who are reportedly in short supply in many parts of the District.
Steel prices are still roughly 5 to 15 percent above last year, but have been falling in recent months. Material costs for construction have remained relatively high compared to two years ago, especially in southwestern Ohio. Prices for paper and some chemicals are also reported to be moving sharply higher. However, earlier reports of rising materials costs have dissipated, and in many cases, prices have begun to come down recently.
Manufacturing employment is holding about even with the second quarter, although hours have come down and many manufacturers have eliminated overtime. Project managers, supervisors, engineers, and other skilled workers are reported to be migrating from western Pennsylvania to Ohio, where labor market conditions are considerably stronger. A report from Dayton indicates difficulty in finding civil engineers and other skilled workers such as machinists and some construction workers.
Respondents continue to report pressure to hold prices down, and margins are still being squeezed by rising costs, especially for labor. As companies prepare to hire temporary workers for the holiday season, there is a strong demand for qualified workers in southwest and northeast Ohio. Cincinnati has many unfilled jobs in the retail sector. One large retailer in northeast Ohio says that hiring difficulties have been partially accommodated with more flexible work schedules.
Price increases on 1996 models have varied from above 5 percent to less than 1 percent, although most have been around 3 percent. Dealers report that higher interest rates are having little negative effect on sales. Although dealers are optimistic that sales will pick up further this quarter, several expressed concern that we are nearing the end of what has historically been the strongest sales period for a new model year.
