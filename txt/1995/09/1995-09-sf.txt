District service-producing industries generally noted continued strong demand, with the exception of some providers of transportation services to business. Truck and rail cargo volumes in the District reportedly have been weak so far this year, given the earlier dropback in some types of manufacturing activity. In Utah, tourism traffic remained at elevated levels, keeping hotels relatively full and fostering room rate increases at a 9 percent annual pace.
Non-residential construction increased in many areas, leading to some additional tightness in the market for construction labor. Major projects for hotels in Nevada and for manufacturing facilities in Oregon and Utah reportedly are creating higher demand for skilled construction workers, and respondents in such fast-growing areas reported difficulty in obtaining bids on small construction projects.
