Among the noteworthy changes in the District in recent months is a rather prominent improvement in construction activity, particularly of single-family homes. Virtually every major real estate market in the District saw an upturn in home sales and construction in July compared to earlier in the year.
Price and wage pressures are reported to be modest. Prices of paper and some plastics are rising, offset by lower steel and aluminum prices. Wage growth is tracking in the neighborhood of what is presumed to be the underlying inflation rate, about 3 percent.
In general, retail inventories have been reduced substantially over the past few months and are currently in a range considered about average for the period. Several District retailers note that computerized inventory management systems and other innovations have helped to monitor stockpiles before any substantive imbalances have developed.
A majority of the dealers we contacted have a positive outlook for the remainder of the 1995 model year, spurred recently by the introduction of factory incentives. New-car stocks are reported to be near a desired level, although scattered reports of inventory shortages were heard. District sources indicate that price increases for 1996 models are running about 1-1/2 to 3 percent above 1995 levels. Interest rates were not considered to be either a positive or a negative influence on recent auto sales performance.
Consumer demand for credit appears to be holding at a relatively high level, and in some cases, such as revolving credit, is still expanding. Most major consumer credit components were reported to be strong, with the exception of mortgage refinancing, which has languished over much of the summer.
While several sources noted a further deterioration in the terms and quality of credit covenants, loan delinquency rates in the District remain low.
