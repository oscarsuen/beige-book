There are some areas of decline, though. Reported layoffs from downsizing and plant closings are scattered throughout the District; such layoffs are slightly more concentrated in durable goods producers than in other industries. A few auto parts manufacturers and makers of industrial boilers and air conditioners point to declining sales as the reason for the employment losses. Some nondurable goods manufacturers also report recent setbacks. An apparel manufacturer announced layoffs because of declining market share. A food producer, although undergoing a plant renovation, is laying off workers as part of a nationwide downsizing effort.
