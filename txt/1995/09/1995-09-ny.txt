On balance, reports on economic conditions in the Second District suggest that growth has slowed in recent weeks. Retail sales weakened considerably in August, with more than half the contacts reporting sales declines. Although the unemployment rate in New Jersey edged down slightly during August, New York State's unemployment rate jumped nearly a full percentage point. Finally, eighty percent of senior loan officers at small and midsized banks report steady or weaker aggregate loan demand over the past two months.
Residential construction across much of New York State and northern New Jersey remained slow during July and August. In New York, the market for new construction is weakest in the central part of the State, while activity in Buffalo and Rochester is sluggish but has generally remained at 1994 levels. One builder in northern New Jersey said housing construction during August was "as dry as the weather". In contrast, residential construction in New York's downstate area showed greater strength than elsewhere in the District, buoyed by subsidy programs for affordable housing as well as continued strength at the upper end of the market.
Purchasing managers in the Buffalo and New York metropolitan areas reported that manufacturing production contracted sharply in August. However, in the New York metropolitan area, strength in the region's larger non-manufacturing sector more than offset weakness in manufacturing. Although commodity price pressures moderated in Buffalo, they increased slightly downstate.
Extremely dry weather has adversely affected field crops across much of the District. As a result, corn, hay, and soybean production is expected to decline from last year's levels.
On a more positive note, tourism--particularly from abroad--has been unusually strong this year. Hotel occupancy in Manhattan for the January through July period was up over four percent from the same period in 1994, while such other tourism-related industries as restaurants, theaters, and museums report that traffic has been brisk. An influx of tourists is expected to visit New York's Finger Lakes region for this month's Ryder Cup golf tournament.
Average loan rates are lower at half of the participating banks and are the same at the other half. The spread between average lending and deposit rates is steady at sixty-five percent of the banks and narrower at nearly thirty percent. Almost all of the respondents maintained their credit standards and all are just as willing or more willing to lend. For the most part, delinquency rates are stable or lower.
