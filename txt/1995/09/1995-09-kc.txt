None of the respondents changed their prime rate last month, but half expect to lower it slightly in the near future. Some respondents lowered their consumer lending rates, but few expect further change in the near term. Lending standards generally remained unchanged.
Half of the respondents report an overall decrease in deposits, but changes were mixed among different types of deposits. Demand deposits and NOW accounts slipped, while MMDAs, large CDs, IRAs, and Keogh accounts rose. Small time and savings deposits were steady.
Higher crop prices, however, are trapping district cattle feeders between higher feed costs and low cattle prices. With cattle prices held in check by record production of beef and competing meats, further losses appear in store for district cattle producers. The size of district cattle herds remains fairly steady, but continued losses may force some producers out of business later this year.
With farm incomes down, district bankers report some erosion in the quality of farm loan portfolios. The erosion is greater among livestock loans than crop loans, due to two years of losses in the district cattle industry.
