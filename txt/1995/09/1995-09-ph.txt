Reports from major economic sectors of the Third District suggest some improvement in activity in August. Manufacturers generally indicated a steady rate of orders and a slight upturn in shipments for the month following several months of declining business. Retailers reported the usual increase in sales for the back-to-school shopping period. Auto dealers said sales have been running at a steady pace. Bankers generally described overall lending as flat to up very slightly, with gains in consumer lending being nearly offset by a decline in borrowing by businesses. Tourist officials in the District said the summer season has been a relatively good one.
The balance of opinion among Third District manufacturers is that business will improve over the next six months. About half of the plant managers polled expect new orders and shipments to rise, while one-fourth anticipate they will be steady, and one-fourth anticipate declines. On balance, surveyed companies expect both the workweek and total employment to remain at current levels during the next six months.
Auto dealers in the District reported a steady rate of sales in August. Sales of four-wheel-drive vehicles appear to have fallen below expectations, however, and price cuts and other incentives to reduce inventories of these vehicles were common. Dealers said sales may pick up as model-year-end promotions are put into place, but most expect the overall sales rate to remain flat through the end of the year.
In Philadelphia, hoteliers and retailers said summer business attributable to tourists and conventioneers had generally met their expectations. City hotel occupancy rates were said to be slightly above rates attained last year despite a large increase in the number of rooms available, and the average room rate had increased from last year as well.
