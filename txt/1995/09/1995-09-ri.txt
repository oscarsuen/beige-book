Agriculture
District agricultural conditions worsened in recent weeks according to agricultural analysts.

Tobacco poundage and quality were below average, especially in the Carolinas. Pastures were in poor condition in some areas of the District. In South Carolina, recent heavy rains caused flooding and minor crop damage; the state also suffered the worst outbreak of southern pine beetle on record, causing the loss of $70 million of pine timber.
