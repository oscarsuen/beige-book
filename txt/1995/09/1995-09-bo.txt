Business activity in the First District is generally expanding, but more slowly than a year ago. Both retailers and manufacturers expect continued slow growth in coming months. Price pressures are reportedly moderate. The residential real estate market is sluggish in most of the New England states.
Price reports for materials are mixed, with declines in lumber and cotton prices and increases for fabric, foam, and paint. Retailers say they and their manufacturing suppliers are hesitant to inch up prices, given this summer's slow shopper traffic. Two contacts plan to expand stores or open new ones; none, however, plans to increase employment.
Over the past year, manufacturers have experienced higher costs for a number of materials, including petrochemicals, paper and packaging, metals, and cotton fibers. In most instances, however, cost increases now appear to be abating; some manufacturers attribute this change to soft-demand. One-third of the contacts report that they have raised selling prices over the past year, mostly in the range of 2 to 8 percent. Remaining prices are generally flat, with some decreases noted for computers and medical equipment.
Most respondents foresee little change in the size of their work forces in coming months. Those who are hiring report that the only area of difficulty is finding qualified specialists in computer-related fields. Labor costs appear to be rising only modestly.
The majority of contacts report that capital spending is increasing, with some making very substantial investments to expand capacity and/or improve productivity. Two contacts mentioned added investments in Mexico.
Manufacturers generally expect the U.S. economy to grow rather slowly over the next year, with little inflation. Most feel that the macroeconomic environment and industry-specific factors will create reasonably good results for their company, but two said an interest rate cut would be desirable.
