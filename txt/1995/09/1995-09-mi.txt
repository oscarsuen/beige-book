The Ninth District is stilt experiencing growth in many sectors but softness is evident in a few. Residential, commercial and heavy building continues to show strength. Business for mining and energy firms remains favorable, with increased oil drilling giving western North Dakota an extra boost. In forest products, paper mills are pressing their output limits, while lumber and building board producers report increased output compared to the spring. As the summer has worn on, favorable weather has improved the prospects for district farmers. Tourist spending is up in the eastern half of the district, but retail and auto sales are generally described as soft. Manufacturing sales are not increasing as rapidly as a year ago. Employment growth is modest; some shortages of skilled and entry-level workers are reported and unemployment rates remain low. Wage increases reportedly are small, as are price increases, and manufacturers report no delays in delivery of raw materials.
Lumber production is up from this spring, and mill operators report improved prices and sales. Hardwoods are the one exception. Building board plants continue to produce at capacity and have eliminated the sharp price discounts offered this spring. Paper mills are generally running flat out.
In livestock, hog prices have risen substantially from earlier in the year in spite of continuing high slaughter levels, and producers are generally making better profits. But cattle prices remain depressed.
Automobile dealers report a roller coaster year with sales very slow in the spring, some strengthening in June and July, but apparent weakening again in August. "People are just being very conservative" says one Montana dealer.
Employment is up modestly in most areas of the district and in most job categories compared to a year ago. Unemployment rates remain below year-ago levels in many areas of the district and well below national levels in all areas except Michigan's Upper Peninsula. "We never used to see "help wanted" signs in Missoula, but we do now," says one Montana small business owner, who reports having to give modest raises to entry-level workers to avoid losing them. Another small business owner in North Dakota lists machinists, welders and CAD/CAM technicians as being particularly hard to hire. But most employers insist that overall wage increases are low.
"We aren't getting any price increases on the material we buy," says one North Dakota manufacturer, "and lead times from order to delivery are back to normal." That seems to be the case for raw materials and intermediate goods in most sectors, with the continued exception of paper and packaging materials. Petroleum product prices have declined 3 cents to 4 cents a gallon from increases posted in late spring and are close to year-earlier levels.
