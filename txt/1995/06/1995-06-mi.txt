The Ninth District economy shows few signs of slackening from the brisk pace reported previously. Manufacturing is strong. Oil drilling is experiencing a resurgence, mines are looking for ways to expand output and paper mills are running full out. The construction sector as a whole is robust, with commercial and heavy building projects more than offsetting declines in residential work. General merchandise sales are improved from earlier in the year. Vehicle sales remain below year-earlier levels, but some sources note an upturn in sales. Employment growth remains robust and employers report continuing problems in finding employees. Few substantial wage or price increases are reported other than for paper products and some industrial inputs.
Adverse weather is responsible for problems in two sectors. Excess rainfall and cool weather severely delayed planting in many areas. Some loss of potential yield appears likely, particularly in the Dakotas. Moreover, the same wet, cool weather has dampened business in most tourist regions.
Favorable prices have paper mills running at capacity and looking for ways to eliminate bottlenecks. Lumber prices are down in response to slowing of residential construction for the nation as a whole, but loggers remain busy. Plants producing oriented-strand board and other plywood substitutes are also busy.
Vehicle sales continue somewhat below levels that prevailed a year ago. In North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota new registrations for the year through May are about 10 percent below year-earlier levels. But there may be some upturn. While South Dakota's year-to-date totals continue to lag 1994, new registrations for the month of May were up 11 percent from year-earlier levels. Some dealers and association representatives confirm some strengthening of sales, particularly for pickups and sport-utility vehicles.
A cold, wet spring has dampened tourism in many parts of the Ninth District Tourism in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan decreased during May from a year ago due to poor weather and the Canadian exchange rate, according to tourist officials. In South Dakota, visitations to major outdoor attractions dropped about 10 percent. On a brighter note, an official in Duluth, Minn., reports a 7 percent increase for May.
With respect to wages and prices, reports are mixed. Paper products continue to increase in price, and there are reports of magazine publishers switching to cheaper grades. Some manufacturers report increases in prices for steel and plastic components. But a builders association noted that building materials prices, especially lumber, have dropped dramatically. Reports on wage trends are mixed. Many employers report they have raised entry-level wages substantially in order to secure needed workers. But others report new wage agreements with increases of 2 percent to 3 percent.
