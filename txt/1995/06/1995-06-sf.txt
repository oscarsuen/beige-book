District service industries report continued strong demand. In a national survey of travel agents, California cities held 4 of the top 11 spots in terms of advance summer vacation bookings. In Las Vegas, the rapid growth in tourist activity tapered off slightly in March, most likely because of severe weather in California. Convention attendance and air passenger traffic continued to increase in March, but auto traffic from California declined.
Commercial and multi-family real estate activity in the District generally remains strong. Commercial office rents in San Francisco are reported strengthening slightly at the higher end. In Las Vegas, commercial construction activity increased in the last quarter, as several new resort-casino projects started and the development of a large new mall continued. Apartment construction continues at a steady pace in Las Vegas. Apartment rents are reported rising at an 8 percent annual rate in Salt Lake City, but rent increases have slowed to a 4 percent annual rate in Boise. In some parts of Oregon, the apartment vacancy rate is reported to be near zero.
