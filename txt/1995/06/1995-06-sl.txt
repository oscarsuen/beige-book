Contacts describe a general slowdown in the national and regional economies, although the regional slowdown is more spotty. Overnight package delivery firms and interstate trucking companies report a slowing in orders. Suppliers to the auto industry have felt the effects of waning auto demand; one such supplier reports the company's first decline in sales in more than a year. Contacts in the apparel industry report that apparel sales are down and do not show any sign of bouncing back soon; however, shoe sales are stable. Competitive pressures have caused firms in this industry to obtain most of their product overseas to control costs. In addition, by managing their clients' inventories, these firms have held prices down and improved overall industry efficiency Generally, international markets appear to be the strongest areas of growth.
Contacts at public utilities report that the pace of new residential installations has fallen because of the construction slowdown; meanwhile, the pace of industrial installations for small businesses has been steady. A chemical company that depends largely on the auto and construction industries reports strong sales in recent months, with plants operating almost at capacity; this company's plastics division has been operating above capacity. This contact expects the recent slowdowns in auto production to dampen sales, though.
Some District industries continue to report growth. Mobile home manufacturers around the District report sharp increases in sales and employment. In addition, they report increases in starting wages to improve recruitment and retention of new employees. Furniture makers in northeast Mississippi are operating at capacity with plans to expand. A contact whose firm makes prefabricated metal buildings also reports rapidly growing sales.
Many areas of the District are still experiencing tight labor markets, particularly for entry-level positions. Some contacts still report difficulty finding qualified applicants. One firm reports a 60 percent turnover rate for new employees, and many firms have resorted to hiring those applicants with "good attitudes," that is, those who are willing to be trained. Some firms have been substituting capital-especially computers-for labor as a way to increase productivity In some instances, though, this action has added to hiring pressures because the new technology raises the job's qualifications, and firms are finding that many entry-level applicants arc computer-shy.
