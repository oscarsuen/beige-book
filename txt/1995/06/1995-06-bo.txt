Economic activity continues to expand in the First District, although signs of a slowdown are apparent. New England retailers are slightly acre upbeat than six weeks ago. Manufacturing contacts report ongoing year-over-year gains in sales. A few have experienced significant slowdowns in incoming orders in recent weeks; the majority have not. The residential real estate market has slowed.
Contacts cite few increases in vendor prices on merchandise; however, they report significant increases in the prices of retailer supplies, such as paper and plastic. An exception is lumber price., reported to have declined by more than 20 percent in the past two months.  Most respondents note an increase in 1995 profits, despite varied success at improving gross margins. Contacts generally anticipate little growth in employment and capital spending in 1995 and wage gains of less than 4 percent.
Views on input coats are mixed, with some contacts reporting that materials prices are stabilizing but others seeing no moderation in rates of increase. In particular, firms using oil-based and paper products (resin, polyester, pulp, paper and packaging materials) note little or no deceleration. Most contacts have achieved selling price increases on selected products, with the increases ranging from 1 to 5 percent. A minority have unchanged prices or across-the-board gains.
Most contacts report that employment levels are little changed from a year ago,  however, two have had recent layoffs, and three cite job gains ranging up to 12 percent. While a few firms mentioned that overtime hours are down, no additional layoffs are planned. By contrast, one-third of the firms have current openings or hiring plans.
First District manufacturers surveyed generally expect capital spending to equal or exceed last year's pace. The increases cited range from 10 to 100 percent. Roughly half of the contacts mentioned the need to ease capacity constraints.
Looking ahead, most contacts describe themselves as wavering between hopeful optimism and watchful concern. They contrast their ownorder books with media reports and are keeping a wary eye on the auto industry, Congress, the stock market and corporate earnings. Some foresee further deceleration in growth; no one expects a recession.
New construction is reported to be significantly slower, as many builders struggle to sell "spec" houses built in anticipation of a stronger spring market. One Massachusetts builder noted that this was his worst spring in a number of years and that layoffs were imminent.
