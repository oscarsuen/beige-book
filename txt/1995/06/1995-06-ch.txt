District steel production flattened out at high levels through the early part of the second quarter,  then declined relatively sharply in late May and early June -- largely due to an explosion and downtime at a large blast furnace in Gary. Orders for steel from auto and appliance producers have eased in recent months, according to a large steel producer, while other markets remain relatively strong. A large appliance manufacturer stated that shipments remain below year-earlier levels, but have improved recently. Appliance industry data suggest shipments increased slightly in April and the first four weeks of May on a seasonally adjusted basis. A large manufacturer of housing products stated that shipments are running ahead of orders, but the company is building inventory even as backlogs decline. "We think things could turn up in the latter half of the year, and we don't want to get caught short."
Capital equipment producers' reports generally remained stronger than those from manufacturers of consumer goods. A large manufacturer of machine tools characterized orders from the automotive Industry as "stable;" with no significant recent cancellations. Manufacturers of construction equipment continued to report strong sales gains. A heavy-duty truck manufacturer reported that orders fell below year-earlier levels after a stronger-than-expected first quarter, but a price increase and tighter order cancellation policies prompted some of the recent pullback. A manufacturer of industrial automation equipment reported a slight decline in orders growth in April and May, but noted that "we've still got a backlog of biblical proportions."
A majority of surveyed District auto dealers reported stronger sales in May and early June than in April, after discounting normal seasonal trends, while a slimmer majority expected sales to strengthen from the first half of the year to the second half. Most speaker presentations prepared for our recent auto industry outlook conference were cautiously optimistic, and the consensus forecast prepared for the meeting implied a small gain for new vehicle sales in the latter half of 1995.
