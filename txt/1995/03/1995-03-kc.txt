Many respondents raised their prime rate last month but expect the rate to hold steady in the near future. While consumer lending rates increased, most banks do not expect additional changes in the near term. Lending standards remain unchanged.
Changes in total deposits among reporting banks were mixed. IRA/Keogh accounts rose, while demand deposits and NOW accounts fell. Changes in money market deposit accounts and small time and savings deposits were also mixed.

Spring credit reviews at district agricultural banks reveal a sharp drop in profits for livestock producers in 1994 and a modest rebound for crop producers. Big crop yields bolstered incomes for crop producers, despite lower crop prices. Weak livestock prices triggered losses for livestock producers. Recent gains in crop and livestock prices have slightly improved the outlook for district farm incomes in 1995.
