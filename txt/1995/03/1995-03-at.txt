Commercial and multifamily real estate contacts continue to report strengthening markets. Several areas of the District report that strong demand is driving apartment construction. Large blocks of contiguous office space are reported to be scarce throughout the region. However, the majority of commercial construction remains build-to-suit with very little speculative space available. Realtors continue to be optimistic and anticipate that both commercial and multifamily markets will continue to strengthen during 1995.
