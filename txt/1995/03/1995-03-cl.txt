A steady or slightly rising proportion of manufacturers are reporting higher employment levels; only a small and declining number indicate reductions. In many industries and regions, companies are having difficulty finding skilled laborers, and indeed, unemployment rates in the District are among the nation's lowest. Several respondents also reported higher rates of labor turnover. Nevertheless, signs of wage pressure are difficult to find, and most companies are still reporting wage growth at, or perhaps slightly below, the rate of inflation. A major commercial real estate firm reports a shortage of industrial space, and industrial construction activity appears to be on the rise.
Several manufacturers report a moderation in the rise in industrial commodity prices, although the number of goods whose cost has increased is still very large and ranges from wood products (lumber, paper, and wallboard), to plastics (polyester and PVC), to metals (aluminum, copper, and steel).
One of the District's largest furniture sellers reports that many suppliers will not quote prices on orders more than 30 days in advance because of the uncertain cost of wood and other furniture construction materials. However, price competition remains severe and retailers say that it is virtually impossible to pass price increases through to consumers.
Slower auto sales have resulted in a considerable unplanned inventory buildup - a dramatic turnaround from the shortages that dealers complained about through the third quarter of 1994. The buildup of vehicle stocks combined with higher interest rates, has reportedly caused a surge in floor plan costs.
Auto dealers also point to higher interest rates as a pivotal development in the new-car market although bad weather in February may also have hurt sales. Still other sources my that rising interest rates for new-car loans are not reducing sales as much as are the restraining income effects of higher mortgage rates on disposable incomes. These higher rates have virtually eliminated home refinancing while boosting mortgage payments for households with variable-rate agreements. Fourth District auto dealers remain hopeful that sales will improve in the months ahead, but few believe that the gains will rival last spring's performance.
Price increases for 1995 new-car models were bumped marginally higher early this year. However, incentive plans are becoming increasingly common, helping to offset the higher costs.
