Discussions with auto dealers were mixed, with the majority indicating some slowing in sales momentum in early 1995. One of the largest auto dealers in the District reported that traffic and sales turned busier in the latter half of February and early March, however, after slowing significantly in January and early February. This contact has not pulled back on orders from its earlier plans; "we've been able to get some extra vehicles, unlike last year when things were really tight and we're taking everything we can get." This dealer expected sales to improve in coming months. Commenting on a competitor's financing promotion, this contact stated that "if we did that, we just couldn't get enough vehicles to sell." Another large auto dealer also reported weak sales in early 1995, partly due to vehicle price increases. This contact stated that sales would likely increase from 1994 to 1995, if interest rate changes stabilize or become less prominent.
A large staffing services firm saw "no sign of a slowdown" in its own temporary placements growth in early 1995. Another staffing firm stated that "there's more business than we can handle, and a tremendous shortage of applicants." This firm expected somewhat greater upward wage pressure in coming months. A staffing firm specializing in professional services reported that robust billings growth continued in recent months. "Clients are more than willing to ante up" if a good candidate is successfully recruited. The manager of recruitment advertising for a newspaper stated that "right now, we couldn't kick the business out of here with a stick." Help-wanted advertising in an industrial materials newsmagazine climbed to record levels in recent weeks. A regional analyst stated that labor shortages in Western Michigan continued to intensify, and noted increasing reports of business expansion plans being constrained by worker shortages.
