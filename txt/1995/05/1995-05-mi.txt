The Ninth District economy continues to grow at a healthy pace in spite of consumer reluctance to purchase new homes and vehicles. Manufacturing is strong. Mines and paper mills are running at capacity. Commercial construction is also robust. General merchandise sales are good, with some sources noting an increase from the January-February period. Tourist business is solid, but not spectacular. Labor markets remain tight, and many employers find it difficult to hire new workers. Prices for industrial inputs continue to show upward pressure but those for construction inputs have eased.
But interest-rate sensitive sectors clearly have slowed. Automobile sales are substantially below year-earlier levels. Home construction has slowed in virtually all areas of the district compared to 1994's heated pace. Weather rather than interest rates is the problem for agriculture, where cold, wet weather has delayed planting and harmed beef producers.
Paper producers enjoy favorable prices and mills are running at capacity. Prices for recycled paper and cardboard have risen substantially as producers compete for raw materials.
Residential building is clearly down from year-earlier levels in most areas. New starts are typically down 5 percent to 20 percent in metropolitan areas. The extreme was Sioux Falls, S.D., where new permits for March declined 60 percent compared to a year earlier. But even that decline was reported under the heading, "Builders positive despite drop." In most areas declines are from a very fast pace set in 1994 and builders generally expect a satisfactory season in 1995. Minnesota's construction employment for March was up 1.6 percent over a year earlier. Reflecting strong commercial work, Minneapolis-St. Paul construction worker numbers increased 6.5 percent in the same period.
A cautious mood was apparent among farmers even prior to April's unseasonable weather. Bankers responding to the Minneapolis Fed's first quarter 1995 survey of agricultural credit conditions describe their farm borrowers as cautious, particularly in regard to capital spending, citing low product prices and uncertainty about the future of federal agricultural legislation. Rates of loan repayment are described as somewhat below normal and requests for extensions somewhat higher, although most farm borrowers are reportedly able to service their debts. Farm interest rates continue to edge up, with most categories in the 10 percent to 10.5 percent range.
Vehicles are another story. New vehicle registrations for the year through March were down about 8 percent for the state of South Dakota compared to the same period in 1994. For Minnesota and North Dakota the declines were 6 percent and 10 percent respectively. Dealers and association representatives agree that the strong sales climate which had prevailed through most of 1994 is definitely over.
Sparse snow cover hampered winter tourism in Montana and many other areas, although Michigan's Upper Peninsula had good cover through March and strong business. Tourism inquiries for the summer are active and up from last year, except in Montana. In South Dakota, visits to museums and major outdoor attractions are up sharply over last year and tourism officials expect a very busy summer season. New motels are being built in a number of South Dakota locations in anticipation of growing tourist business.
Prices continue to increase for industrial inputs, particularly paper, packaging and basic chemicals. But lumber and other construction materials' prices have moderated somewhat. One Montana mill reportedly cut 2x4 lumber prices sharply to move excess inventory. Petroleum product prices rose in March and April, and are now about 4 percent above a year ago. At the consumer level, some fresh vegetable prices are markedly higher but meat is steady to lower. Few other price changes are reported.
