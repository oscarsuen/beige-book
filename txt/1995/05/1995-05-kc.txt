No respondents changed their prime rate last month and none expect to do so in the near term. Few banks altered their consumer lending rates last month, and none anticipate changes in the near future. Lending standards also were unchanged.
Deposits were up slightly last month. Demand deposits, money market deposit accounts, large CDs, and small time and savings deposits rose slightly, while changes in NOW accounts were mixed.
Cattle feedlots in the district were relatively full last month but held fewer cattle than a year ago. Bankers remain cautious about lending to cattle feeders, as many fear a possible drop in cattle prices this fall. Despite record supplies of beef and low cattle prices during the past year, few district cattle producers are reducing their cow numbers.
