Several District sources note a rise in labor turnover in recent months, and applications for job openings are reportedly down. Skilled workers are particularly difficult to find, although shortages of unskilled workers are also seen in some areas. However, wage growth in the District remains moderate, reportedly in the 2 to 4 percent per year range.
Industrial space is said to be in short supply. and this has apparently put some upward pressure on rents. Likewise, we continue to hear reports of rising prices for a broad range of industrial commodities, particularly aluminum, steel, caustic soda, and paper. However, resistance to finished goods price hikes continues, with capital goods producers in the District appearing to hold the line on any increases.
Within the overall sales picture, some nondurable goods have been strengthening slightly, while the demand for durables has flattened or declined. Furniture sales have eased slightly, as have home decorating products more generally. One observer linked the sales slump here to the drop-off in home sales last fall.
Retail profit margins are said to be very thin as higher wholesale costs continue to squeeze flat finished-goods prices.
Dealers cite a number of factors, including the unseasonable weather and higher interest rates, for this weakness. New car loan rates are approaching, or in some cases have already reached, double-digit levels. Surprisingly, auto credit is reported to be readily available, and local finance markets are said to be aggressively competing for borrowers. Moreover, higher bank rates for vehicle loans are being partially offset by factory incentives, including special financing arrangements and cash rebates.
Auto inventories are higher than desired in many District markets. However, there are still shortages of a few popular vehicles, apparently resulting from production glitches rather than a shortage of capacity.
