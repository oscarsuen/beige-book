The pace of the expansion continues to moderate in the First District. Most retail contacts report disappointing sales results. Manufacturing activity has slowed since the fourth quarter, but year-over-year gains reportedly continue at a satisfactory pace.
Contacts note that vendor prices have inched up 1 to 3 percent over the last year, with steeper increases in the prices of rubber, cotton, leather, and especially paper. Gross margins and profits for 1994 were up slightly from the previous year. Most contacts plan zero or very small increases in capital spending and employment this year.
Tourist industry contacts report a large increase in the number of visitors to New England in March and April, particularly to the Boston and Cape Cod area. The rise is attributed to more international travelers, Americans' current preference for family-oriented short trips, and the 375th anniversary of the Pilgrims' landing. Despite the increased numbers, tourist officials observe that domestic visitors are spending less in souvenir shops and restaurants.
Manufacturers described double-digit price increases for a wide variety of commodities, including rubber and petroleum-based products, paper, wood pulp and packaging materials, cotton, fabrics, and metals. Several also mentioned the impact of the yen's appreciation on the cost of inputs from Japan. Views were mixed on whether commodity price increases are abating. Just over half of the respondents are starting or continuing to raise selling prices on selected products. The others, facing ongoing competitive pressures, are holding the line.
Employment is slightly above year-ago levels at more than half of the manufacturing contacts, and one-third plan selective hiring in the coming months. Still, several First District manufacturers remain in the midst of previously announced consolidations; some of these firms plan ongoing cutbacks but at a slower pace. No one noted any labor shortages or wage pressures. Over half the contacts expect capital spending in 1995 at or above last year's pace, with the focus on cost-cutting equipment and new product development.
Although growth is widely seen to be moderating in response to higher interest rates, most contacts expect their own firms and the U.S. economy to keep expanding at a satisfactory pace. A few are keeping a wary eye on the consumer, but most anticipate a "soft landing," with little pickup in inflation.
