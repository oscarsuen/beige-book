New vehicle sales remained relatively slow for the time of year, according to a survey of District auto dealers, but dealer optimism remained high. Used vehicle sales continued to strengthen, particularly for late-model cars, and dealer service revenues related to "fix-or-buy" decisions were not increasing in line with what might have been expected if the new car market were fundamentally weakening. Vehicle availability has improved, and a dealer association stated that "dealers still don't want to get caught short like they did last year." Incentives declined from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the first quarter of 1995, but area auto dealers expect higher rebates as well as increased dealer incentives in May and June. Significant redesigns for half of the top 10 selling vehicles are reportedly constraining new vehicle sales. A survey of auto dealers indicated that interest rates on new car loans continued to increase in recent months.
Reports from District realtors suggest that existing home sales improved in March and April on a seasonally adjusted basis, with declining interest rates on mortgage loans playing an important role. Expectations for future sales have risen in recent months. An association of home builders stated that new home sales are still anticipated to decline slightly in 1995, after a very good year in 1994. "Builders are prepared for some slowing, however, and inventories are not especially high." Traffic quality (buyer interest, credit-worthiness) remains strong. Cement producers also expected somewhat slower growth in shipments volume, partly because of weaker-than-expected public infrastructure spending. Shipments for cement used in residential construction gained renewed momentum in the region in recent months, however, and overall shipments volume is still expected to post a new record in 1995.
