Most districts continue to report economic expansion, although in some areas the rate of expansion has moderated recently. The Upper Midwest, Southeast and West continue to expand. Other areas are experiencing little or no growth. Expansion of retail sales also varies by geographic region, with the center of the country generally doing somewhat better than other areas. Manufacturing, particularly the auto and construction-related industries, continues to slow in many districts. However, orders are up in some districts, and inventories generally are considered to be at acceptable levels. Reports of tight labor markets come from many districts, but few report increased wage pressures. Three-quarters of the districts continue to report higher prices for raw materials, but the rate of increase is decelerating. Retail prices are generally unchanged or up modestly. In most areas of the country, residential and commercial real estate markets are picking up; loan demand is steady or strengthening. Weather concerns dominate reports from most agricultural-producing districts, while livestock producers face reduced profits because of lower selling prices and higher feed grain prices.
Reports on auto sales are mixed, ranging from sluggish in the Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts, to above last year's levels in the Cleveland, Dallas and Kansas City districts. In the Philadelphia district, increases in auto sales are leveling off from their higher rates earlier in the year, and dealers in the St. Louis district report flat to moderately strong growth. In the Chicago district, auto leasing is very strong.
The Atlanta, Chicago and Kansas City districts report some gains in overall production, with Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco noting increases in orders. The demand for machinery has jumped significantly in the Boson district. Computer and electronic firms in the Atlanta district indicate that recent increases in orders are adding to their backlogs. Heavy truck manufacturers in the Cleveland district report that a backlog of orders is sustaining theirbusiness. The Chicago district notes a decline in steel demand, while St. Louis is experiencing an expansion in the steel industry.
Exporters in the Boston district report that even though sales to European markets have been sluggish, demand from developing countries has grown substantially. Inventories at firms in the Cleveland and Kansas City districts are at desired levels, but firms in the Atlanta district report that levels remain below those posted earlier in the year. Small high-tech firms in the Minneapolis district note expanding activity.
Input price increases at the manufacturing level are more widespread and appear to be more prevalent for raw materials like paper and wood products, chemicals and certain metals. Nine districts report higher input prices; of those nine, two-Boston and Cleveland-expect to see higher prices of cotton goods and furniture, respectively, later this year. In the Dallas district, on the other hand, recently announced increases in chemical prices have been rescinded, and in the Chicago district, prices for steel and resin have actually declined.
Activity in commercial real estate markets, especially industrial markets, continues to increase or hold steady across all reporting districts. Commercial vacancy rates have declined in the Minneapolis and Richmond districts, while holding steady in the Dallas and Philadelphia districts. The multifamily sector is strengthening in the Atlanta, Boston and Dallas districts. New residential construction is reported in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Minneapolis districts and in selected portions of the Richmond and San Francisco districts.
Energy production has changed little despite lower oil prices. A marked decline in crude oil price has not prevented an increase in oil drilling activity in the Kansas City district. Despite lower natural gas prices in the Dallas district, drilling activity for natural gas is reportedly higher. Minneapolis reports robust growth in its natural resources industries. In particular, copper and wood products producers are operating at capacity, while activity in the San Francisco district's mining industry is increasing.
