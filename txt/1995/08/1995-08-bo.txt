Economic activity is slowing in the First District. Sales or revenues of a majority of retail and manufacturing contacts in New England are flat to down from a year earlier. Most prices are reportedly flat. Commercial real estate markets are mixed, with the office and retail sectors weaker than last year.
Most vendor prices remain stable; by exception, recent increases in cotton prices are expected to boost prices of cotton goods this fall and winter. Most retailers, particularly off-price discounters, are struggling to maintain gross margins and profits. Only two contacts plan significant increases in their 1995 employment levels and capital budgets.
In contrast to the disappointing retail situation, the region's tourist industry reports extraordinary activity this summer, far exceeding expectations. Both Americans and foreigners are attracted to New England, reportedly by reasonably priced package vacations offering mental points of interest, much as outlet shopping, cultural events, and outdoor experiences.
Manufacturers indicate that their input end selling prices are mostly flat. Prices of petrochemicals and copper are reportedly rising and shortages of memory chips are leading to some temporary price increases. One contact notes that an anticipated increase in paper prices did not materialize, while another reports that surcharges for chrome appear to be ending. Prices of computers and of machinery sold to automakers continue to fall.
Capital spending has increased over the past year at most contacts, with close to half the sample reporting a substantial increase. Much of the additional investment is being driven by the development of new products. In some cases, a changing product mix is also leading to selective hiring.
Most manufacturers believe that they will be operating in an environment of slow economic growth in coming months. Some are hopeful that new products or successful promotion of existing products will boost sales.
