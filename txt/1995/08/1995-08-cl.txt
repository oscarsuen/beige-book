No indications of an inventory imbalance at the manufacturing level are noted, and virtually all sources consider current production and employment levels high by historical comparison. Labor appears to be amply available, with only a few, scattered shortages of skilled workers, notably in the northern Kentucky region.
Retail price increases remain moderate, with apparel prices actually declining during the past several months. Women's apparel prices have been especially depressed. Despite observations that demand for home-improvement products has been soft, furniture prices are expected to rise as higher materials costs are pushed through to retailers. Some labor shortages are occurring in the retail sector, especially in larger cities. Several retailers also note plans for capital expansion and renovation.
District auto dealers report that mid- and -large car sales have surpassed small-car sales, and one dealer notes that sport-utility vehicle sales have quadrupled from last year. Demand for options has also strengthened during the summer months. Virtually all dealers report lower new-car inventories from the District report of two months ago, but new car inventories vary substantially by model, ranging from a 35 to 90 days' supply.
Manufacturer incentives have helped sales when used. One dealer reports that incentives have offset the effects of high interest costs, although a few sources noted that new car loan rates have begun to edge lower from their recent cyclical peaks.
Bank lending remains especially strong in the commercial credit area, where loan demand for plant and equipment expansion, mergers, and inventory floor plans has increased substantially from the spring. Household borrowing is also reported to have strengthened, with an improvement in consumer and new mortgage credit over the past several months. Despite the continued rise in debt levels, however, District banks are reporting exceptionally low delinquency rates, particularly for consumer-related credit. Several institutions cite delinquency rates of less than 1 percent.
