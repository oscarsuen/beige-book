Agriculture remains a problem sector due to persistent low livestock prices and adverse weather. But crop prospects have improved substantially since mid-spring and the 1995 crop will likely be good, though well below 1994's record.
This strength in non-residential construction is more than compensating for the slight slowing of residential work. As evidence, construction employment in Minneapolis-St. Paul is up 8 percent from a year ago. For Minnesota as a whole and for North and South Dakota, employment in the sector is up 1 percent to 2 percent in spite of some slowing of single-family home building in many areas. Some residential builders report strengthening sales of new homes in mid-summer and restored buyer confidence in the economy, although they do not expect a return to 1994's record levels.
"Our residential business has really picked up since mid-winter although it is still below 1993 and early 1994," says a Minnesota regional manager for a major realtor. And one major mortgage lender reports strong increases in new loan and refinance business in early summer, although competing firms claim little change.
Lumber mills have been whipsawed by gyrations in lumber prices, but output remains generally stable. For loggers, any decreases in work for sawmills is being offset by pulpwood cutting for paper mills. Paper producers continue as capacity and pulp and paper prices are at record levels.
In contrast to the improved situation for crops, livestock production continues to have severe problems. Cattle and hog prices remain depressed and the recent runup in grain costs is further squeezing producers. Periods of extreme heat in mid-July slowed livestock gains and caused severe death losses for district turkey producers.
Automobile sales numbers remain slightly below 1994 levels, but the gap closed somewhat in early summer according to new registration data. Dealer association representatives also report improved dealership traffic and buyer interest in many areas.
As the weather improved from mid-spring to mid-summer, so did tourist business in many areas, although the 1995 season is not expected to set any records. Sources in Montana report mixed conditions, with higher-altitude areas such as Glacier National Park suffering from cold, wet conditions well into July. But western South Dakota destinations report improvement. Camps and lake resorts in northern Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan had good business in July as urbanites fled extreme heat.
Reports on wages and prices are mixed. Pressure to raise entry-level wages clearly continues. One South Dakota grocery distributor had to raise hourly starting wages for data entry and warehouse workers from $5 to $7 in order to fill jobs. But wage contract settlements at many firms continue to be in the 1 percent to 3 percent range.
Once again paper is the most visible culprit in product prices. Prices of many printing and packaging grades are at historic levels. Copper, brass and aluminum are also more expensive and, in some cases, on backorder. Lumber prices have been volatile but generally well below a year ago. Gasoline and diesel prices were several cents above 1994 levels, but this spread has diminished in recent weeks.
