Auto and appliance output firmed up on a seasonally adjusted basis, but have yet to post any significant rebound in spite of reports of great retail sales growth. Light vehicle deliveries strengthened in June and early July, and some industry analysts even expected auto output to increase slightly in the third quarter. Heavy-duty truck order cancellations rose considerably in recent months however, and build plans imply a decline in assemblies by the end of the year. Factory shipments of major appliances weakened slightly on a seasonally adjusted basis during late June and the first two weeks of July, after strengthening in May and early June. Factory inventories of appliances fell sharply in June, and then flattened out in recent weeks. Reports from heavy machinery manufacturers remained relatively upbeat. For example, a construction industry analyst reported that unit sales of new equipment rose sharply in the latest reporting period (May). Year-to-date, this contact reported that sales in the Midwest posted the largest year-over-year increase in the nation, despite especially adverse weather earlier in the year. An air cargo firm focused on construction equipment and parts stated that "we had a huge June, and expect July and August to be just as strong."
