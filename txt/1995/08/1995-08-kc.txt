Most banks report no change in their prime rate last month, but some banks lowered rates and additional declines may be forthcoming. Only a few banks lowered consumer lending rates or expect to lower rates in the near term. At all banks, lending standards remain unchanged.
Total deposits at district banks were steady last month. MMDAs increased slightly and NOW accounts decreased slightly. Large CDs, demand deposits, and small time and savings deposits were unchanged.
Higher crop prices have also boosted feed costs and deepened losses for district cattle producers. A surge in red meat and poultry production promises to hold down cattle prices, delaying a rebound in industry profits. With profits down, some district ranchers plan to trim the size of their breeding herds.
Overall, farm income in the district may decline slightly this year after a much steeper drop last year. The drop in farm income has weakened business activity somewhat in small rural communities that depend heavily on agriculture. But business conditions remain healthy in the larger rural trade centers that have a broad economic base.
