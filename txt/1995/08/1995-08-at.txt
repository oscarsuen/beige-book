Commercial and multifamily contacts continue to report strengthening activity. Multifamily construction demand continues to be strong in many areas of the market but has slowed slightly in some. The majority of commercial construction remains build-to-suit; however, several major speculative office buildings have broken ground recently or been announced within the District. Realtors are optimistic and anticipate that both commercial and multifamily markets will continue to strengthen moderately during the remainder of 1995.
