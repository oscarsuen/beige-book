Builders describe the inventory of unsold homes as normal or slightly less than normal and report that home prices have climbed during the past year. Building materials are readily available, and most builders expect little change in prices or availability of material in the next few months, despite a recent decline in lumber prices. Mortgage lenders throughout the district expect mortgage demand to remain strong during the next few months.
None of the respondents banks changed their prime rate last month, and most banks anticipated no change in their prime rate in the near future. A few of the respondents lowered their consumer lending rates slightly, but most expect no change in the near term. Most of the banks report no change in lending standards.
The higher crop prices have also pushed up feed costs, however, worsening the profit outlook for the district cattle industry. Fed cattle prices recently rose to profitable levels for the first time in six months. But large supplies of beef and competing meats may limit further gains in cattle prices, while higher feed costs squeeze profit margins. With feedlot profits weak, cattle feeders are paying less for young cattle entering feedlots, triggering losses for district cattle ranchers. As a result, many ranchers are expected to trim the size of their herds, and some may quit the business in the months ahead. On balance, higher crop prices have brightened agriculture's income prospects only modestly, due to lingering problems in the cattle industry.
