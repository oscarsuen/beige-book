Reports from District auto dealers through mid-November have been mixed. A major Midwest dealer of foreign nameplates reported that sales of core products were doing well but sales of niche products--especially sports cars--were weak. A domestic nameplate dealer described sales of new models as "spotty," but indicated that November sales were on target to meet expectations. Several dealers noted that minivan and sport/utility vehicle sales have shown improvement, while auto sales remained weak.
In contrast to the auto-related sectors, several reports from other producers suggest some recent slowing in demand. A small steel producer serving a diversity of markets reported that recent orders were flat to slightly down from last quarter, although production was being maintained by selling more steel to their affiliates. An analyst in the medium and heavy-duty truck industry reported a slowing pace in gross orders and fairly high cancellations, but noted that production of some models was being maintained even though inventory was being built. Producers of construction equipment continued to indicate an easing in orders and production. A major appliance producer reported that demand has been mixed, with demand for refrigerators and freezers doing well while demand fordishwashers has weakened. In contrast, producers of agricultural equipment reported that demand was strong.
