Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic activity continues to expand, but at the somewhat slower pace reported in the last beige book. Most district banks indicated little change from the last report; however, Cleveland and New York reported slower growth, and Chicago reported moderating growth in manufacturing. Many districts noted that retail sales appeared stronger in early November following widespread weakness in October. Districts reporting on initial holiday sales found mixed conditions. Dallas and New York said sales were lower than expected, while Atlanta, Chicago and Cleveland reported encouraging holiday results. Most reports of auto sales were weaker.
Manufacturing production continued to rise, with strong demand for high-tech products in the Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts. However, several district banks reported slowing in some manufacturing industries. Single-family construction activity was mixed, but commercial real estate and construction activity remained a bright spot in many districts. Loan demand increased in most Federal Reserve districts, with strong demand for commercial and industrial loans. Demand for most business services remained strong.
Rising crop prices boosted farm income in Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis, yet higher feed costs and low cattle prices continued to squeeze margins for ranchers in some districts. Energy activity was mostly unchanged, despite a cold snap in the Midwest and Northeast that caused prices for natural gas, heating and crude oil to rise.
Most Federal Reserve districts reported tight labor market conditions for both skilled and unskilled labor. Several districts, including Chicago, Dallas and Minneapolis, reported rising wage pressures for entry-level positions. There were a few reports of price increases in intermediate goads, but very few for final goods.
Vehicle sales weakened over the past six weeks according to several district banks. The Kansas City and St. Louis districts said a shortage of popular models constrained sales. Auto dealers in Philadelphia said sales of new model cars have not met expectations, and dealers in Chicago noted sports/utility vehicle sales were outperforming auto sales. Dallas was the only district reporting improved sales.
A few districts reported increases in multifamily construction. In the Atlanta district, low vacancy rates and higher rents were boosting new apartment development. The Kansas City and St. Louis districts also reported a pickup in apartment construction over the past six weeks.
The Dallas and Kansas City districts reported little change in energy markets, despite a weather-related rise in natural gas, heating oil and crude oil price in recent weeks. Natural gas spot prices rose from $1.70 per thousand cubic feet in mid-October to $2.10 per thousand cubic feet by late November. Wholesale heating oil prices rose by 5 cents per gallon as colder weather hit the Midwest and East Coast. The price increases were not enough to encourage new drilling activity, however. Mining and drilling contacts in die Minneapolis district were pleased with current levels of activity.
