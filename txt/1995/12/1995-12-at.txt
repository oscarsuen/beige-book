Commercial and multifamily real estate contacts from across the District characterized their markets as strong. Low vacancy rates and higher rents have spurred new apartment and office development in many local markets. While most office and retail projects continue to be build-to-suit, contacts also noted that a number of speculative projects have gotten underway in recent months. Real estate professionals remain optimistic about the prospects for each of these markets, and most anticipate that the pace of new construction of both commercial and multifamily projects will be strong through much of 1996.
