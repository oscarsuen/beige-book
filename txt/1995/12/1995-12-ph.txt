Economic activity in the Third District moved up in November, although the improvement appeared to be modest. On balance, manufacturers reported increases in orders during the month, but the gains were not nearly as widespread as they had been earlier this fall. Retailers indicated that cold weather had boosted sales of winter apparel and that the overall pace of sales was turning up, with Christmas shopping running about in line with their modest expectations. Auto dealers, however, said sales of new models were running below expectations and the sales rate has been slipping. Bankers generally reported continued growth in major credit categories, and some renewed strength in consumer lending, primarily credit cards.
The outlook in the Third District business community is generally positive, although expectations are not robust. Despite the recent easing of growth in manufacturing activity, the balance of opinion among plant managers in the region is that growth will accelerate in the first half of next year. Retailers anticipate that sales for the holiday shopping period this year are likely to be ahead of last year's by only a few percent in dollar terms. Bankers expect to add to commercial and industrial loans outstanding, and they expect some further growth in consumer lending, but they are apprehensive that retail sales may ebb, limiting the gain in this credit category.
Despite the slower growth in November, the balance of opinion among Third District manufacturers is that shipments and orders will pick up during the next six months. While most firms plan to maintain steady payrolls, slightly more intend to add workers than cut back. Investment spending plans are positive as well. On balance, manufacturers are scheduling higher capital outlays in the next six months.
Auto dealers reported that sales of new model cars have not met expectations; as a result, inventories have risen above desired levels. The rate of unit sales has slipped from the pace set in the first three quarters of the year, according to dealers contacted at the end of November, and they are paring back their sales estimates for the fourth quarter and for 1996.
Looking ahead, bankers expect some further increases in commercial and industrial lending, although they expect the market for new business loans to remain competitive. However, they anticipate that retail sales will not be strong and that, consequently, gains in consumer lending as well as lending to retailers will be limited in 1996.
