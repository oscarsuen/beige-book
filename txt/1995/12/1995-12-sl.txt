Rebates and other incentives have been used by about half of the respondents to spur sales.

A defense subcontractor reports business is picking up because of recent contracts secured by a major St. Louis-based defense contractor.

The District's apparel industry is contracting because a national manufacturer is closing two District plants and scaling back production at a third. A total of 1,265 people will lose their jobs. Another apparel firm is also closing three District plants, which will affect 700 people. In both cases, slack demand and fierce foreign competition are the causes. The southern Illinois mining industry will shrink again as three more mines close, eliminating about 700 jobs. Depleted reserves and declining demand for high-sulphur coal are being blamed for the shrinkage. A District shoe producer has announced it will leave the production aide of the business and focus solely on marketing and sales. This plant closure, which affects 195 people, is part of the company's cost-cutting and reorganization plan.
