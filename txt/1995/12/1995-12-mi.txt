Moderate growth with few problem. continues as the watchword for the Ninth District economy. Construction, which caught a second wind in late summer, is busy right into the winter. Most natural resource industries have strong output and some firms plan new investment in plants or equipment. With the exception of cattle producers. most farmers had a reasonably good year in 1995 and are investing carefully in machinery. The holiday shopping season began with strong Thanksgiving weekend sales, but in general consumer spending on automobiles and general merchandise is cautious. The winter tourism season is off to a good start. On balance, manufacturing orders are slowing somewhat, particularly in firms related to vehicle production, but other firms continue to report strong sales. Tightness continues in most labor markets, but few increases in wages or prices are apparent.
Commercial building, particularly offices and warehouses in Minneapolis-St. Paul suburbs and in other regional cities, continues active into early winter. Publicly-let heavy construction ends the year as it began, slightly ahead of robust year-earlier figures.
Hog producers continue to face prices that are above late 1994 levels and generally adequate to cover costs. Beef producers, on the other hand, continue in their slow financial hemorrhage. For many producers, the value of calf sales in 1995 was about half that of 1993, the last year of good prices. Dairy farmers are being squeezed by higher feed costs resulting from increased grain prices, but their financial situations are generally reported as stable. Many farmers express concern with continuing uncertainty about the outcome of the 1995 farm bill, particularly its dairy and Conservation Reserve Program provisions.
"It is not that people don't have money, it is just that they are being very careful about how they spend it," is how a dealers' representative describes auto sales in South Dakota. His description is applicable to most areas of the district. Vehicle sales generally continue slightly below 1994 levels, with great variation between different regions. North Dakota, with good crops, strong construction, and oil activity, generally has good sales, particularly of pickup trucks. South Dakota, with a poorer crop and low cattle prices, reportedly has good sales in its larger cities, but slow ones in farm and ranch areas.
Paper continues to head the list of products with price increases. Agricultural commodities follow and non-ferrous metal prices continue high. But there the list runs out, and reports of price decreases continue for some types of steel and other intermediate goods.
