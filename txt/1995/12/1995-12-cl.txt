Price pressures remain somewhat light considering the relatively high level of business activity. Presumably, improved productivity levels are contributing to this environment. Furthermore, optimism appears to be relatively high in the District, as evidenced by further expansion in business investment and generally strong consumer spending.
Capital goods producers indicate a substantial lessening in orders growth in the past several months, and a few cancellations of earlier orders are noted. Nevertheless, net new orders are still characterized as good, and most industries report plans for capital expansion in 1996. Moreover, export markets are considered quite strong.
While some industries report capacity shortfalls, most indicate that factory overtime has eased. Instead, pressure to restrain the rise in costs through improved productivity and innovation is reported as the driving factor in many business' capital expansion plans.
Wage growth is in the 2% to 3% range, about the rate of inflation. Some worker shortages are reported, such as in engineering. Most manufacturers indicate difficulty finding qualified job applicants, although fundamental changes in the workplace, rather than the current state of the business cycle, are seen as the underlying problem.
Preliminary information on the bellwether post-Thanksgiving weekend sales is incomplete, but somewhat encouraging. Several respondents report strong traffic and suggest that sales were well above last year's level. These results are consistent with a recent survey suggesting that nearly three-fourths of area households indicate they will spend "at least as much" this holiday season as they did in 1994. Casual apparel was highlighted as an area of particular strength this season.
Retail inventories n moving lower as store traffic has increased. Still, inventory levels are running somewhat higher than desired. Some retailers note difficulty finding qualified seasonal sales help as a consequence of generally strong District labor markets.
Interest rates are having little or no reported effect on sales, although a few dealers complain that high rates are dampening business. Leasing activity continues on an upward trend, accounting for about 50% of sales at District dealerships.
Though generally rising, commercial borrowing has slowed since summer. One source noted a sharp falloff in borrowing to finance inventories. Most banks report a rise in past-due loam, although the present level of loan delinquency is judged to be very low. Competition for deposits remains severe, and deposit levels are reported to be holding about even.
