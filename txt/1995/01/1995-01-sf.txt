The services sector continues to expand moderately, boosted by gains in tourism and business services and less of a drag from restructuring in the health care industry. Hospitals were reported to be more willing to make investment purchases recently. Hotel occupancy rates were reported to be high in most of California and Utah, owing in part to convention activity and a strong start to the ski season. Among business services, software development has been strong, and in tight labor markets--such as in Idaho-wages for computer programmers were reported to be increasing rapidly.
The government sector remains weak, and new concerns about budgetary pressures have been expressed in some areas. In Oregon, wages of state government employees are scheduled to be cut in mid-1995. In eastern Washington, expectations of a significant reduction in the workforce at the Hanford site this year are dampening the business outlook in that area. In Southern California, respondents expect the Orange County bankruptcy and investment pool losses to result in a combination of local government layoffs, service cuts, infrastructure project delays and cancellations, and higher "user fees."
