Lending is active in most institutions, and credit margins are still narrowing. Only in the mortgage area has there been a significant drop-off in loan growth since the last District report.
Capital goods producers continue to report a further growth in orders, with the domestic auto industry a heavy source of demand. Orders for metal-cutting and metal-forming machine tools are strong, following the upward trend in steel demand: The orders backlog here extends well into 1995. Export orders for capital goods are improving gradually for European customers, and District manufacturers expect sales to Europe to improve further in 1995. Small growth in the Japanese market is also hoped for this year. However, there still is reported to be little room for substantial price increases for finished capital goods, despite reports of production constraints by many capital goods producers.
Industrial materials producers also note strong business conditions, especially steel and chemicals suppliers. Both industries are also reporting improved sales volume in Europe. Industrial materials production is reported to be near capacity and raw materials prices are still increasing, particularly for steel and certain industrial chemicals. However, plans to increase employment in these areas remain modest.
District auto ales in December were also average for this time of year, but some vehicle types are still reported in short supply. Most dealers indicated availability problems with the 1995 models, particularly light trucks and utility vehicles. There is a presumption that low inventory positions dampened dealers' sales performance in December.
Consumer borrowing remained high during the holiday period, and revolving credit balances are reported to be substantially above this time last year. Mortgage credit activity has fallen off, and although some of this is typical for the season, higher mortgage rates are presumed to have flattened mortgage refinancing.
