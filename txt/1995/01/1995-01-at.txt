Contacts in the apparel industry continue to report a shrinking factory workweek and payrolls. Temporary help firms supplying personnel for manufacturers report that the pace of placements remains brisk. Foreign orders for military aircraft have brightened the outlook for Lockheed's Marietta, Georgia, facility. However, recent cancellations or scalebacks of U.S. Department of Defense contracts continue to adversely affect many defense-related firms in the District.
The recent peso devaluation has some regional manufacturers concerned that exports of their products will slow as U.S.-made products become more expensive in Mexico. A broad range of regional industries has posted significant gains in exports to Mexico since NAFTA was enacted last January. Most industrial contacts remain optimistic about the near-term outlook.
Commercial and multifamily real estate contacts continue to report improving market conditions. The apartment market is characterized by steadily rising rental rates and high occupancy levels. Contacts say that, as a result, multifamily construction is on the rise in many areas of the District. Commercial realtors also report declining vacancy rates and steadily increasing rental rates. While commercial construction is reportedly accelerating, the majority of current construction is build-to-suit with most of the space leased prior to building, leaving very little speculative space available. However, builders say that shortages of skilled labor continue to push building costs up. Realtors anticipate both commercial and multifamily markets will exhibit continued strong growth in 1995.
