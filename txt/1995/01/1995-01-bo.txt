Reports from First District businesses in early January were similar to those in October and November. Manufacturers' gains are widespread, while retailers' results vary considerably. Prices of selected inputs are reportedly rising.
Retail contacts' expectations for the first half of 1995 also vary widely, ranging from 0 to 20 percent sales growth from a year earlier. Vendor and retail prices remain fairly level, although the number of exceptions is growing, including plastics, resin-based products, paper, and cotton. Most contacts report higher profits in fiscal 1994, and only one mentioned lower gross margins because of holiday promotions. Major capital and employment expansions in 1995 are limited to the top- performing large category chain-stores.
Manufacturers report significant cost increases for paper and packaging, plastics, steel, polyester fibers, and postage; moderate cost increases for chemicals; unchanged costs for cotton fibers; and declining costs for electronics components. Selling prices mostly are flat or slightly higher than a year ago. Some contacts report that their industrial customers are imposing limits on price increases. In other cases, negotiated agreements with suppliers, a lack of labor cost pressures, or greater operating efficiencies are limiting the need for price hikes.
At most respondent companies, U.S. employment has remained flat or has decreased at a single-digit rate over the past year. Only a couple of smaller firms have expanded their work force to any significant degree.
Most manufacturers expect good results in 1995, although the majority anticipate a slowdown in U.S. GDP growth by the second half of the year. Exports are projected to be a bright spot. Several contacts say that they will try to raise prices before the anticipated slowdown.
Employment was flat in the fourth quarter at all but two insurance contacts (who expanded slightly). Half the respondents plan to cut employment in 1995, some significantly; the rest plan either small increases or no change.
