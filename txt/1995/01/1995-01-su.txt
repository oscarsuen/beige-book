Production and orders trends in durable goods industries continued to lead growth within the overall manufacturing sector. Cleveland's industrial contacts indicated that orders growth remains solid, with particular strength in capital goods industries. Automotive contacts reported some of the strongest sales gains within Boston's manufacturing sector. Cleveland and Chicago reported strength in demand for steel, with Chicago noting that steel output plans for the first quarter were recently increased in response to stronger automotive orders. Auto parts suppliers continued to announce construction of new production facilities in the Atlanta region. Increased exports to Europe boosted recent results among Cleveland's manufacturing contacts. Uncertainty over Mexican developments clouded expectations in several regions, however.
Increasing wage pressures were reported more frequently in the Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while Kansas City stated that tightness in markets for skilled manufacturing and construction labor had eased. Surveys by compensation consulting companies in the Chicago region suggest that salary increases for exempt salaried employees of large firms will remain in line with 1994, while pay varying with sales growth, profitability, customer service, or other organizational goals will continue to take an increased share of total compensation.
Manufacturers continued to report strong (but perhaps diminishing) pressure against output price increases. Boston stated that long-term agreements with suppliers, low labor cost increases, pressure from customers and greater operating efficiency continue to limit many manufacturers' needs for output price increases. Reports from a minority of Districts included a growing set of exceptions to this rule, however.
Retailers in Dallas and San Francisco noted higher price pressures from rising packaging costs. Labor shortages and strong demand increased price pressures among service firms in the Dallas region. Agricultural businesses in the San Francisco region expressed concern about rising labor, transportation, packaging, and raw materials costs.
