Car dealers generally report increased sales in December, in some cases of up to 20 percent over last year, although some dealers lost sales because of continued shortages of popular models. Many cite creative leasing programs and improved local economic conditions as boosting sales, despite slightly higher prices on 1995 models.
Growth in sales and employment continues around the District. Farm equipment dealers report that although sales were down slightly in the most recent period, 1994 was a record year, with sales up about 12 percent over the year before. Various manufacturers in western Tennessee and eastern Arkansas report sales and revenue increases of between 15 percent and 40 percent in late November and early December over the prior month. These contacts report, though, that profit margins are much tighter because of competition and rising costs.
Reports suggesting that many firms are facing capacity constraints are increasing. For example, a food processor reports significant overtime, a printing establishment has all plants running at capacity, and a maker of packaging products now operates three shifts to meet increased demand. In addition, announcements of new plants come from the Little Rock area, northern Kentucky, central Arkansas and northwest Mississippi. Each will bring at least 200 jobs into their areas, most by June.
