Most large retailers indicated that year-over-year sales gains improved as the season matured, except in apparel sales. For example, one large durable goods retailer characterized sales in the last week of the season as "booming," with sales gains running well ahead of previous weeks. A number or retail chains indicated that toy sales gains were in line with or stronger than companywide averages, and home entertainment software and computers were among the strongest gift-giving categories.
Excluding apparel sales, most large retailers reported better overall sales gains in the District than their national average. A late December survey by an accounting firm suggested that Midwest consumers had higher planned and actual spending levels than consumers in any other major Census region. Large prospective and actual bonuses in the auto industry boosted retail sales in Detroit and other areas of the District.
The District has experienced large-scale expansion in retailing capacity in recent years. As a result, survey data, reported same-store sales gains, and anecdotal evidence on individual store chain results may well understate the strength of aggregate sales growth. Increased retailing capacity also helps explain why discounting ran more aggressively than many retailers anticipated at the onset of the 1994 season, in spite of strong demand and customer traffic. The strongest holiday sales gains seem to have arisen in products where prices have been declining (such as computers and electronics) and in outlets where prices are relatively low. Several retailing analysts suggested that discount stores took a larger share of holiday sales growth in the region during 1994, as consumers turned more aggressive in their search efforts alter a less-cautious shopping season in 1993. One large outlet mall characterized its holiday sales season as "awesome." Customer traffic was up nearly 30 percent based on vehicle counts, and the number of motor coach trips to the mall were up 36 percent. Separately, this contact noted that charitable gift giving rose markedly from 1993.
A large automaker stated that dealer orders and showroom traffic remained stable or even picked up a little around the industry in recent months, on a seasonally adjusted basis. A large steelmaker stated that first quarter production plans were recently raised in response to modestly higher auto industry demand than originally anticipated. An association or machining shops reported that production continued to trend higher in recent months, with machine tool purchases among its membership surging since the industry trade show in September. One machine cool manufacturer stated that customers' capacity expansion projects accounted for a greater share of orders growth in recent months, joining continued gains in orders for tools designed more closely for productivity improvement.
