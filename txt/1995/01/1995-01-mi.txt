As 1995 opens, the economy of the Ninth District shows robust growth in most sectors. Manufacturing is very strong. Construction is active for the winter season, with commercial projects replacing residential buildings as the focus of strength. Iron mining expects its best year in over a decade and other metal mining faces favorable conditions. Forest product output remains high, with paper production continuing to gain strength. Modest recovery in depressed farm prices reportedly is fueling some increases in farm capital spending. Consumers are actively buying vehicles, and sales of general merchandise are generally good.
But not all is favorable. Winter tourist businesses are having a slow year so far, largely due to unfavorable weather rather than lack of demand. Residential building remains below year-earlier levels, and sales of existing housing have slackened.
Moreover, some problems associated with strong economic growth persist. Urban labor markets are very tight and may businesses have difficulty in securing employees. Businesses continue to report higher wage increases than were common in recent years. Reports of price increases in raw materials and intermediate goods are common and some such goods are increasingly difficult to secure.
Production of corrugated cardboard and other packaging as well as printing paper continues to increase. Output of other forest products, including lumber and building board, continues strong, and Montana timber employment and output have regained much of the ground lost when a major mill closed in 1993.
However, residential construction clearly has retreated from earlier highs in many areas of the Ninth District Single-family home permits issued in the Minneapolis-St Paul area were somewhat below year-earlier figures in October and November, and industry spokespersons indicate that the same will be true when the December numbers are available. A major home builder noted that actual slowing was less than originally anticipated and stated that business was still good. He cited increasing numbers of new home buyers opting for adjustable rate mortgages as the primary reason why residential housing activity has not slowed more than it has. This pattern, of some slowing from year-earlier levels, but of still maintaining good levels of activity reportedly is true in other urban areas of the district.
Markets for existing homes are cool, however. A Minnesota residential realtor describes sales of existing homes as depressed from levels that prevailed in the two previous winters. Existing home sales reportedly remain strong in rapidly growing urban areas such as Sioux Falls, S.D., and Billings, Mont., but have slowed slightly in other areas.
Consumers continue to go for new vehicles. North Dakota's registrations of new passenger vehicles for December were neatly 5 percent above the already healthy sales experienced a year earlier. Reports from registration agencies and dealers' associations in other states confirm this pattern.
Winter tourism activity was slow in parts of the Ninth District apparently due more to sparse snow cover than to weak demand. Officials in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and northwest Wisconsin report a 50 percent decline for December 1994, compared to the prior year. Business stayed even for December at a northern Minnesota ski resort, while snowmobiling dropped from year-earlier levels. Despite unfavorable exchange rates for Canadian skiers, a northwest Montana resort reports a slight increase this season.
Both manufacturers and building contractors report price increases for materials they need. Some steel uses still experience delivery delays. Precast concrete panels also reportedly are in short supply, in spite of plants running seven-day a week, 24-hour schedules. However, prices of petroleum fuels continue to drop.
