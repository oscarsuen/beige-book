Reports on District developments in recent weeks by and large indicated some improvement. Most retail contacts reported that holiday sales were on or slightly above their expectations and office leasing activity was sufficient to reduce the vacancy rates in several parts of the District. District unemployment rates fell sharply in December. Homebuilding activity, though, has been seasonally slow. Almost 90 percent of the senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks reported steady or lower aggregate loan demand compared with two months earlier.
The annual survey of the Retail Council of New York State found that sales gains throughout the state averaged 3 to 5 percent above the 1993 level for the day-after-Thanksgiving through day-after-Christmas period. Household durable goods, computers, VCRs, jewelry, accessories and in-line skates were some of the best-selling items. Individual retail contacts in the District reported over-the-year changes ranging from virtually flat to +8 percent during December. Inventories were generally in satisfactory shape by year-end with most contacts expecting to eliminate any excess amounts during January clearance sales.
While office leasing activity has reportedly slowed somewhat from earlier months, it was sufficient to reduce the vacancy rates in several parts of the District recently. In downtown Manhattan the office vacancy rate has moved down in each of the last three months after a jump in September, while in midtown Manhattan, the rate in December was a full percentage point lower then three months earlier. Among other areas reducing office vacancy rates between the third and fourth quarters were Fairfield County, Connecticut and, in New York State, Westchester County, where the rate fell more than two percentage points, and Nassau County. Office vacancy rates rose in the fourth quarter in Northern New Jersey and Suffolk County.
On a more positive note, New York City was one of six cities chosen nationwide as urban empowerment zones, each of which will receive $100 million in social service grants and tax breaks for businesses located in the zones. In addition, KMart recently signed a lease to open its first Manhattan store--the latest of the chain stores making their first forays into the borough in response to lower rents and the enticement of population density.
Loan rates are mainly higher or the same across all categories of lending. Almost all of the respondents noted that recent increases in deposit rates resulted in no change or a narrowing of the spread between the average lending and deposit rates. Of the senior loan officers surveyed, about 80 percent maintained and about 20 percent increased their willingness to originate various types of loans. Very few banks changed their credit standards, and almost all had stable or lower delinquency rates.
