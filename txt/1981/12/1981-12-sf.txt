The Twelfth District economy appears to have weakened further in the last month. Retailers report stability in sales in November, following October's decline. But early indications point to a disappointing Christmas season, with December sales just about matching the year-earlier level and thus failing to keep up with inflation. Serious deterioration is evident in the manufacturing and mining sectors, where production cutbacks and layoffs are becoming deeper and more widespread. Moreover, growing inventories point to further production cutbacks. Residential construction and home sales continue at extremely depressed levels with the recent decline in mortgage rates having no appreciable stimulating impact. Farmers are experiencing a further reduction in income as a result of a continuing decline in commodity prices. Commercial loan demand remains slow for capital spending purposes but has increased to finance excess inventory. Banks continue to suffer an outflow of deposits to higher-interest bearing market instruments. Sales of the All-Savers Certificate have dropped sharply after an initial flurry. These certificates have had little effect in bringing in new savings or reducing the cost of deposits.
In the Western lumber and metal industries, further price weakness is forcing additional closures and curtailments. Western lumber production currently is running about 45 percent below the 1978 peak and a further drop in output is expected. Copper producers in Arizona and Utah recently announced further production cutbacks. The Bunker Hill Company will permanently close its silver and zinc mining facilities in Idaho this month, laying off 2,000 workers. Kaiser Steel Corporation plans to phase out primary steel production at its Fontana, California, plant and to continue only fabricating operations.
Slow commercial orders are forcing further layoffs in the aerospace equipment manufacturing industry. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation plans to discontinue production of its L-1011 jet transport. Orders had slowed to a trickle due to the poor financial performance of the nations s airlines. Semiconductor firms in California have scheduled extended shutdowns during the Christmas holiday period to reduce excess inventories. In fact, excess inventory is becoming a more pervasive problem in the manufacturing sector, pointing to a further broad-based production decline.
