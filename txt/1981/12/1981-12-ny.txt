Economic activity remained sluggish in the Second District during November, with some further softening evident. Retail activity unexpectedly slowed before Thanksgiving but has since recovered somewhat. Poor conditions persisted in manufacturing and additional weakening in capital goods orders was observed. Residential construction continued to be depressed, but a falloff in nonresidential construction contracts was believed to be temporary. Business economists now expect sizable declines in real GNP during the fourth quarter and no real pickup until the second quarter or half of 1982. On the financial side, mergers, acquisitions, and cash shortages pushed up the demand for business loans.
Other manufacturers also experienced flat or slightly lower sales. Even the previously strong demand for data processing equipment has slipped. The only increase in business was reported by a company whose aerospace division received a large quantity of new defense contracts. Businesses are adjusting to the bleak situation with stringent cost controls, the elimination of internal inefficiencies, and in one case, a restructuring of pricing policies to curtail price cutting competition.
Schott: Institutional money flows are beginning to improve under the influence of lower interest rates. But demand for long-term funds is very heavy, partly in order to improve liquidity ratios and partly to finance investment projects, especially in energy. Therefore, long rates may stay relatively high.
Financial markets are less concerned with fiscal 82 Federal deficit than with the grim prospects for fiscal 83 and 84. Money growth targets and fiscal prospects are viewed as clashing, with the private sector the likely victim.
Stone: By letting borrowings get so low the Fed has effectively severed the connection between the discount rate and the Federal funds rate. The funds rate will nevertheless hold up in December, if only because of the seasonal strength in short term credit demands. But when these demands subside in January, for seasonal and perhaps for cyclical reasons as well, short term rates could fall sharply. Such a drop in rates could well be followed by a surge in the aggregates at what might be a most unpropitious time.
Recent increases in aggregates should push required reserves up, and I believe the Fed should respond by letting enough borrowings emerge to reestablish the connection between the discount rate and the funds rate. "Enough" borrowing for this purpose are $500-600 million exclusive of seasonal borrowings and extended credit. Once that connection is reestablished the Fed can again do what it did so effectively over the past two or three monthsâ€”lead the rate structure downward at its own pace by periodic reductions in the discount rate.
By this means the Fed is most likely to achieve the objective of lowering interest rates while minimizing the risk of a serious overshoot in the aggregate.
Wojnilower: Such indications as I am able to gather from business contacts support the view that the business decline may soon slow materially. This prospect, coupled with apparent acceleration of monetary growth, is roiling the bond market. Severe securities market repercussions are to be expected if average Federal funds rates were to rise.
