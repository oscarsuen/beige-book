The recession is continuing in the Sixth District. Consumer spending is flat compared to last year, housing remains severely depressed, and labor markets are slack, with layoffs occurring frequently throughout the District. Agricultural loan delinquencies are increasing.
Alabama has been particularly hard hit. The state unemployment rate was bordering 12 percent at last reading and some directors reported rates above 13 percent. Those high unemployment rates are supported by a growing number of layoffs. In Alabama, weak demand forced General Electric Company, to place its entire work force on furlough last month. Fruehauf, producer of bodies for tractor-trailers, has half of its work force on indefinite layoffs. Exxon closed one of its subsidiaries in the Orlando, Florida area, and the Ford Glass Plant in Nashville laid off a large portion of its work force and will close earlier than usual for the holiday season.
In north Georgia, where 50 percent of the nation's carpets and rugs are produced, shipments dropped sharply in October after having shown some growth during the prior nine months. The fourth quarter will likely show a drop-off of 20 to 30 percent in shipments. A slowdown in the paper industry is causing temporary closings at paper mills during December. Although the factory employment picture looks bleak at this time, for the most part, manufacturers believe the forecasts of economic recovery in the spring of 1982.
Persistent high interest rates have dealt a severe blow to car rental companies. In Florida, believed to be the largest car rental market in the nation, a large rental franchise recently declared bankruptcy. Attendance at Florida's major tourist attractions is down somewhat from the same period last year, and the outlook for the winter season is not bright.
Borrower liquidations will increase in cases where collateral for additional indebtedness is unavailable, but lenders hope to keep foreclosures to a moderate scale.
Southeastern farmers have planted as much or more winter wheat as they did in the fall of 1980 when acreage jumped by 225 percent from the year-earlier level. Farmers are again in need of a quick cash-earning crop.
