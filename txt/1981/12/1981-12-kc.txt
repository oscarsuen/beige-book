At savings and loan institutions in the Tenth District, savings inflows in 1981 were down considerably from last year. Most savings and loans hope for some slight improvement in inflows in the near future, primarily due to hoped-for inflows from the new IRAs that the institutions plan to offer after January 1, 1982. The demand for mortgage funds at Tenth District savings and loans is reported as low-to-nonexistent, resulting in abnormally low levels of mortgage commitments. Most of the weakness in mortgage demand is attributed to high mortgage rates, which are currently averaging 17 percent at Tenth District savings and loans. Those rates are expected to fall slightly by the end of the first quarter of 1982, resulting in some slight improvement in mortgage demand and mortgage commitments.
Deposit growth continues to be strong in areas with sizable loan demand but is relatively flat elsewhere. Most of the growth has occurred in the large CD category. While some banks continue to rely on CD's to finance new lending, other institutions are using CD's to reduce their exposure in the overnight market. Across the District, bankers report more than adequate liquidity.
After an initial spurt, consumer interest in All-Savers Certificates has tapered off and most institutions contacted anticipate little activity in the future. Attention has now turned to IRA/Keogh programs. Most bankers surveyed are extremely optimistic about these accounts becoming a stable source of long-term funds. However, there are considerable differences of opinion about the volume and sources of funds that might be attracted to these accounts.
