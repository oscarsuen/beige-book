The slump in business activity that the Ninth District has been experiencing since midsummer deepened in November and early December. Consumer spending remained depressed; new manufacturing orders continued to decline, with consumer durables and home building supplies hard-hit; the iron mining and lumbering industries weakened further; and falling farm prices continued to plague agriculture. The continued softness in the district economy has kept bank lending depressed. The one bright spot is that the winter sports industry has been buoyed by above-normal snow.
Consumers were still very reluctant to purchase homes and autos. The Minneapolis Board of Realtors reported that home sales in Minneapolis and suburbs declined 15 percent between October and November. New car sales in November, according to regional sales managers for domestic manufacturers, remained at September's depressed level.
Spending on winter sports appears to be the exception to the general sluggishness in the district's consumer spending. A lack of snow during the last two winters hurt businesses dependent on snowmobiling and skiing. While Montana still needs snow, in Minnesota early snowfall is about 12 percent ahead of normal and spending on winter sports has been good. Sales of tow tickets at one major northern Minnesota ski area, for example, are up 30 percent from of a year ago.
The iron mining and forest products industries also remained in the doldrums. In November, the unemployment rate for Minnesota's iron ore workers remained at around 20 percent. Likewise, sawmills throughout the district that were closed in October remained closed through December. In Montana, of 56 sawmills, 16 are closed and 20 have curtailed operations.
The falling prices for grains and soybeans can be attributed to abundant supplies and falling demand. As reported in our last Redbook, district farmers had bumper crops this fall. But the markets for these crops haven't been strong. Grain shipments going east on the Great Lakes totaled 3.2 million tons in October this year as compared to 4.2 million tons in October last year. Shipments west by rail also were reportedly down this fall.
