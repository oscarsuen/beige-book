Although there are a few signs that the Ninth District's business activity improved in April and early May, the sluggishness noted in our last report has generally persisted. The signs of improvement came in consumer spending and agricultural conditions. General merchandise sales increased modestly, and auto sales surpassed their low prerebate levels. Also, farm prices rose and part of the district received some much-needed rain. The other components of the district's economy, however, continued to be sluggish. Manufacturing activity remained sluggish as gains in some industries' orders were offset by declines in others, and iron ore, lumber, and home sales continued in the doldrums. In addition, construction activity has recently been disrupted by strikes. These weaknesses were reflected in sluggish bank lending.
Accompanying the pickup in general merchandise sales has been a modest revival in auto sales. District car sales did decline in early April after being boosted by the rebates in March. But a regional sales manager for a domestic auto manufacturer states that sales in late April and early May exceeded their low prerebate levels and that in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area April sales were large enough to give most dealers a profit.
While general merchandise and auto sales, although still quite weak, showed signs of improvement, home sales have not picked up. Mortgage loan applications at Minneapolis-St. Paul S&Ls in April were unchanged from March's depressed level.
