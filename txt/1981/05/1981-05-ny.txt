Economic activity in the Second District continued to be mixed in April, with marked improvement particularly evident in the consumer sector. Several retailers experienced exceptionally large sales gains, and there was strength in some parts of the automobile market. While new orders for capital goods remained weak, the backlog of unfilled orders has sustained production levels. Inventories were at acceptable levels in all sectors. Unexpectedly strong growth in first quarter GNP prompted business economists to revise upward their forecasts of real activity in 1981. Slower growth is still expected for the second quarter, however, followed by a general pickup in the latter half of the year. On the financial side, activity in the home mortgage market is far below year-earlier levels.
The demand for higher-priced domestic automobiles continued strong while sales of less-expensive American models remained sluggish. Dealers attributed weakness of the latter to high prices and high costs of financing. Meanwhile, a dealer of relatively expensive domestic cars reported his third consecutive month of record sales. Foreign car sales improved, but remained weaker than a year ago. No inventory problems were indicated.
O'Leary: With a clash between forces toward a stronger expansion in real output, with continued high inflation, and monetary policy aimed at squeezing down the expansion of money supply, both short-term interest rates and long-term rates are likely to remain very high through 1982. The expectation that inflation will remain high, and that interest rates will remain high and volatile, is drying up the availability of funds for the purchase of long-term, fixed-rate bonds and mortgages. Borrowers are thus forced to continue to borrow short-term, much of it in the commercial banks, with the effect of giving an upward bias to the expansion of the money supply. Should interest rates, on average, remain high and credit tight for an extended period—say through 1982—there will be a severe crisisfor many thrift institutions and probably for some life insurance companies. The need to place greater weight on fiscal restraint to help the monetary authorities is great.
Schott: The financial market reaction to the strength of the economy and the run-up in the money supply figures is exaggerated and likely to be short lived although it is understandable. Borrowers and investors alike are uncertain how much additional interest rate fluctuation is going to be induced by strict emphasis on monetary aggregates. Hence, there is precautionary borrowing, and great reluctance to lend in the face of possible further major disintermediation.
The level of interest rates is excessive relative to business conditions and underlying inflation. There will be a correction as soon as the money aggregates return to roughly target levels.
Wojnilower: The current business situation appears flat and slightly up. Businessmen, except in the housing and auto industries, are virtually unanimous in their optimism about the short and long run business outlook. Financial markets are more than ever preoccupied with day to day swings in security prices.
