Agricultural loan demand remains low throughout the District while fund availability at agricultural banks appears to be more than adequate. Many farmers and ranchers have begun the year in a lower equity position than at this time a year earlier. In some parts of the Tenth District, agricultural producers have been able to pay only the interest on last year's loans and requests for renewals or extensions are higher than normal. District bankers estimate that the number of agricultural borrowers who will have repayment difficulties by the end of 1981 may be twice as many as in a normal year. Although many bankers are recommending the Farmers Home Administration as an alternative source of credit to their borrowers this spring, most are not concerned over proposed cutbacks in this program.
Deposit growth was generally stable this past month. Most bankers report moderate growth in NOW accounts, and expect further small shifts from demand deposits to NOW's. Demand deposits are mixed, with the strongest growth in Oklahoma and Colorado. Time deposits other than MMC's and savings deposits other than NOW's are either stable or declining at most banks. Some banks with strong loan demand are continuing to attract funds by marketing large CD's.
