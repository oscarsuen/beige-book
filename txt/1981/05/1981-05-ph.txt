Indications from the Third District in May are that business remains sluggish to mixed. In the industrial sector, area manufacturers report a few signs of expansion this month but, for the most part, overall manufacturing activity has remained basically unchanged. Local manufacturers anticipate widespread pick-ups in general activity within the next six months, though. Area retailers report sales up over year-ago figures, rebounding in May from the losses suffered last month owing to a mass transit strike in Philadelphia. Contacts forecast marginal increases in their sale volumes within the next six months but no "boom" in sales is expected. Third District bankers report mixed loan activity in May as C&I loan volume is up but consumer loans are off by as much as 16 percent. Looking ahead to the next six months, business loans are expected to increase slightly and retail loans to remain flat. On the residential construction scene, sales are mixed. New residential sales are running about even with May '80 levels, while resale volumes have dropped as much as 50 percent.
As for the future, survey respondents are predicting widespread pick-ups in general industrial activity within the next six months. New orders and shipments are expected to take off between now and November, and, as production picks-up, area manufacturers plan to make some additions to inventories. Labor stands to gain from such optimism, as survey respondents plan to lengthen the average workweek and hire new employees within the next six months. Increased capital expenditures are also forecast.
Area industrial prices are up again in May as 70 percent of the survey respondents report paying more for raw materials than they did last month, and about one-half say they are charging more for their finished products. Local manufacturers expect inflation to continue over the next six months as nearly 9 out of 10 respondents anticipate higher input costs by November and nearly 8 out of 10 are planning price hikes for the goods they sell.
Looking ahead to the next six months, local merchants expect the current trend of strong sales to continue but are planning cautiously. Contacts project sales over the period to run only slightly ahead of last year's levels, about 4 to 7 percent. According to one spokesman, the first quarter of 1981 was strong and the second quarter should be better, but no "boom" in sales is expected. Inventories remain in-line with no changes in stock levels planned, as retailers hope to keep inventory-sales ratios healthy.
Reports of deposit flows in the Third District are mixed. Demand deposit levels range between 4 percent below to 2 percent above year-ago levels, savings and time deposits 4 percent below to 5 percent above May '80 figures. Contacts blame the lackluster performance on the fact that many customers are putting their money into 26-week certificates and money-market funds in order to get a higher return on their money.
Third District bankers are currently quoting a prime rate of 19 percent. Projections of the prime indicate an expected drop in the rate, leaving it about 200 basis points below the current level by November.
In New Jersey, residents could face power blackouts this summer if the UMW strike continues into July. Electric utilities there report having only a 60-day supply of coal remaining. South Jersey's power problems have been compounded by increased tourism in the Atlantic City area, since casino gambling was legalized in 1978. Officials are predicting a record-breaking number of visitors to the shore this summer, requiring a large amount of electrical power. Spokesmen for the utilities say they will face some supply difficulties even if the strike ends soon. To prevent blackouts, utility officials are urging customers to conserve energy and industrial users to cut down on non-essential use.
