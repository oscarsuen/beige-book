Farm credit conditions at midyear were similar to those in the first quarter. Both the slowdown in farm loan demand at banks and growth in the availability of loanable funds continued in the second quarter but at an accelerated pace. Bank interest rates on farm loans remained volatile, registering sizable increases over rates in both the spring quarter and a year ago. There was some improvement over the previous quarter in loan repayment rates and requests for renewals. Repayment rates were below these at this same time last year, however. Liquidity pressures of banks active in farm lending rose slightly but remained well below a year earlier.
