Nine Redbook reports indicated weakening in activity since the last FOMC meeting, with varying degrees of emphasis. Exceptions were Dallas and Philadelphia, where activity was judged to be expanding, and St. Louis with "no marked change". Inflation appears to have moderated, but most observers fear a resurgence. Virtually all reports commented on the depressive impact of current high interest rates, especially on housing, but also on nonresidential construction, capital goods, motor vehicles, and inventory investment. Employment is sluggish, at best, in most districts. Retail trade is mixed, but with auto sales severely depressed everywhere. Labor unrest, highlighted by the air controllers' strike, is increasing. Capital goods demand is generally weaker. Energy development and defense procurement are among the few strong sectors. The higher value of the dollar has tended to slow exports and increase imports, but quantification is difficult. Consumer credit use has slowed. New residential mortgages are difficult to negotiate under current terms. The S&L crisis deepens. C&I loan demand varies, with merger-related loans a big factor in money centers. Crop prospects are "good to excellent" in most of the nation. The new fiscal package is viewed as favorable, but no substantial early impact is foreseen. Many observers anticipate a revival in activity late in the year or in 1982, but only if interest rates decline.
