Economic activity in the eighth district has remained sluggish in recent weeks according to area business representatives. Retailers reported that real consumer spending was generally flat in July, and some inventory accumulation occurred for air conditioning equipment and other mid-summer sale items. Overall, manufacturing activity has shown no marked change. Sales of building supplies, metals, and some chemicals have weakened, whereas sales of energy-efficient equipment, oil and gas drilling equipment, and military hardware continue to rise. Home construction remains at a very low level, and numerous bankruptcies of small builders were reported. In the financial sector, little overall change in loan volume has occurred. Savings and loan associations are beginning to offer mortgage loans with adjustable interest rates, and officials of these institutions are pleased by the inclusion of the tax-exempt saving certificates in the recent tax legislation. In the agricultural sector, crops are generally in excellent condition.
Deposits at area financial institutions continue to increase despite stiff competition from money market mutual funds. Although passbook savings accounts at district banks continue to moderately decline, time deposits have increased rapidly. Deposit growth at savings and loan associations has been less rapid than at banks, and there are reports that some deposits, primarily, large CDs, have been moved from S&Ls to banks due to the financial condition of some S&Ls. Some S&L officials expressed optimism that the new tax-exempt saving certificates would help them compete for relatively low-cost funds.
