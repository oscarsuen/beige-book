Reports from the Twelfth District indicate that economic activity is weakening. Respondents report little recent change in consumer spending, but volume remains below the level of a year ago. Consumers are especially hesitant to buy large items. Unemployment is rising, especially in construction-related industries. District homebuilding activity has slowed further recently, and sales and permit activity point to still further declines. Agriculture continues strong, but exports are beginning to slow because of the rising foreign exchange value of the dollar. Exports of aircraft and forest products also are being curtailed by currency developments. Commercial loan demand is increasing moderately, but because of business cash flow problems rather than improved conditions. Mortgage lending activity at financial institutions is nearly non-existent, with rates as high as 18 percent. Financial institutions are experiencing increasingly severe earnings pressure. Savings and loan associations are especially hard hit as a result of a continued record outflow of funds and the heavy burden of low-yield mortgage portfolios.
