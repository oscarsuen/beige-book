Reports from the Third District indicate that business activity is sluggish at this time, but hold some hope for improvement by mid-year. Manufacturers report no change in overall industrial activity, but continue to make small cuts in payrolls and working hours. They expect a sharp upturn in the industrial sector to come sometime in the first two quarters, though. Local retail merchants report sales to be slow in January and expect only slight improvement, at best, by July. Credit collections are said to be good. In the financial sector, area bankers report mixed loan activity in January as C&I loan volume is up but consumer loans are off. Looking ahead to July, District bankers expect modest increases in overall loan activity. On the residential construction scene, sales are down again this month as high mortgage rates have discouraged many buyers. In the meantime, contractors and developers are holding the line on new groundbreakings.
Looking ahead to the next six months, survey respondents remain optimistic, anticipating a significant upswing in general industrial activity. Over one-half of the survey participants expect new orders to grow in the first half of 1981, while a slightly smaller portion project increased shipments between now and July. Manufacturers are playing a close hand, however, and are planning cautiously. Respondents to the survey are projecting no changes in stock levels or the average workweek and plan to hold off on new hirings as well. Increased expenditures on plant and equipment, however, are anticipated.
Prices are up again in January in the industrial sector. Input costs are higher for about 65 percent of the survey participants and almost 40 percent report charging more for their finished products. For the longer term, 9 out of 10 of the responding manufacturers expect to be paying higher prices for raw materials by July, while about 8 out of 10 plan price hikes for the goods they sell.
Area retailers continue to plan cautiously for the next six months, expecting sales to run only slightly ahead of year-ago figures, owing partially to the lack of strength in consumer disposable income. According to local merchants, sales performance in the first quarter will set the trend for the first half of 1981. At best, only slight improvement is expected by mid-year.
Local bankers are currently quoting a prime rate of 20 percent. Loan activity should be sluggish over the next six months, they say, which will cause the prime to drop between 300 to 575 basis points from its current level.
With the legalization of NOW accounts effective December 31, 1980, area bankers report vacillating deposit flows in January. The rate of growth of the accounts is faster than had been anticipated for the most part.
