In December and January, Ninth District business conditions remained sluggish. General merchandise sales as well as manufacturing and mining production expanded modestly, auto and home sales continued at November's depressed level, and the output of saw mills declined. These weaknesses were reflected in the continuing sluggishness in bank lending. Agricultural conditions, on the other hand, were still quite good, but recent price changes and moisture levels hint that they might not remain as good later this year.
Although agricultural conditions have been good, they might not continue to be in the future. Since November, for instance, farm prices have either remained the same or declined. Between November and mid-January, corn and wheat prices did not increase and soybean prices dropped 9 percent in Minneapolis. During this same period, cattle prices did not increase and hog prices declined 8 percent in South St. Paul.
The lack of moisture is also a potential problem in parts of the district. Except for the district's northeastern corner, the district has received very little snow. As of mid-January, the district's eastern half had only about an inch of snow on the ground and the western half had no snow. This lack of snow has endangered the district's winter wheat crop and aroused concerns that the soil may not have enough moisture to get this spring's crops off to a good start.
