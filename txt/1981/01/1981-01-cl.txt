However, January's orders are considerably better than expected for early 1981. Inventory adjustment remains the major source of strength, with steel consumers no longer trimming inventories, except perhaps for industrial machinery, and steel service centers continuing to build inventories. Steel consumption has held up better than expected, according to an industry economist, because the auto industry has not deferred or canceled orders. Orders from the auto industry were lean to begin with, but an industry economist expects deferrals to begin in February. The steel industry made profits in the fourth quarter of 1980 (in some cases, sufficient to offset year-to-date losses), according to one producer, and may make profits in the first quarter of 1981 if orders continue to hold up.
The reason loan commitments have not fallen as much as expected, according to an economist with a regional FHLB in the District, is that S&Ls have been able to raise money and build new liquidity. NOW accounts particularly have attracted larger amounts of funds than expected. While some switching from passbook accounts has occurred, an S&L official reports that new money is being attracted. Despite offering less competitive terms than area S&Ls, a bank economist also notes a net increase in funds from NOW accounts.
