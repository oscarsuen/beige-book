The economy of the Seventh District is probably the weakest   in the nation, with no improvement in sight. Its dominant durable   goods industries, both consumer and capital goods, are operating   well below capacity. Some companies, however, report a recent   uptrend in orders. While credit is available, high interest rates   are severely restricting activity, especially housing and vehicles,   but also inventory and capital spending policies generally. Some   S&Ls face possible financial crises. Unemployment is high and jobs   are hard to find. Retail sales were strong just before and after   Christmas, but may have slowed recently. Farmland values rose again   in the fourth quarter.
The Seventh District has probably been   impacted more severely than any other by the economic problems of   the past two years. Industries concentrated here—especially motor   vehicles and components, farm equipment, and construction equipment—are in deep trouble with no improvement seen in the months ahead.   Instead of counterbalancing a slump in industry, as has happened in   the past, the district's farm sector also has been depressed.   Economic stringencies, strongly reinforced by outward migration of   people and industry, have made the housing situation much worse here   than nationally. High and rising energy prices have had a relatively   more harmful effect here, mainly because of heating costs. The   district has received little benefit from the energy boom or the   defense buildup.
Labor markets. New unemployment insurance claims remain at high   levels throughout the district. Help-wanted lineage in Chicago   papers was 40 percent below a year ago in the fourth quarter, and   January has been about as bad. Although computer programmers,   nurses, and certain other specialties are in short supply, demand   for workers, generally, is very weak. Some examples: (1) an   erroneous report that a Chicago-area major steel company was hiring   attracted several thousand people, who created a dangerous mob   scene; (2) an ad for bus drivers in Milwaukee brought a deluge of   applicants that overwhelmed interviewers; (3) a trucking company   reported a much improved supply of qualified drivers; (4) a bank in   a smaller Indiana city reported 60 applicants, two-thirds qualified,   for one clerical position paying $7,500. Companies interview many   people "overqualified" for available jobs. Quality of entry-level   job applicants in the larger cities, however, is deplorable.
High interest rates. Record high interest rates clearly are holding   back many types of activity. Loans of all types continue to be   available to creditworthy borrowers, in contrast to the situation   last spring. However, tighter lending criteria turn away increasing   numbers of marginal borrowers. More important, interest as a cost   has become an overriding consideration for many businesses, and   institutions. Car dealers are being forced out by "killing" floor   plan rates-22 1/2 percent, recently. High rates have kept   inventories abnormally low for many manufacturers, distributors, and   retailers. Some smaller manufacturers who had been expanding   steadily are deliberately shrinking their operations in order to   hold down interest costs. More larger firms are restricting outlays   to internally-generated funds. High rates paid for CDs are seriously   undermining many S&Ls, some of large size.
Firms with a "receivables problem" are increasingly   widespread. A dramatic stretchout in payments on receivables   occurred for some firms in the past year. Partly, this is because of   weakened financial positions of customers, but it also reflects a   desire to reduce borrowing costs, and, in the case of cash-rich   firms, to increase earnings on liquid assets.
Backlogs for most types of capital equipment and   components appear to be declining, but there are notable exceptions.   Farm and construction equipment are especially weak with some plants   closed. Railroad equipment is in a steep decline and heavy trucks   have softened. In contrast, the oil and gas field is swamped with   orders. Heavy castings picked up in December, but output is only   about 50 percent of capacity. One diversified capital goods producer   reported an uptrend in orders in December, followed by a surprising   surge in early January, but the reasons are not clear, and this   improvement is not reported by companies.
Output schedules for cars and trucks are being   reduced, and sales estimates for the year have been scaled down. The   new slump has affected even the most popular small U.S. and imported   cars. The auto industry blames the Federal Reserve for its plight,   playing down higher prices. Since consumer loan rates are widely   subsidized, the "perception" of high rates is blamed. Dealerships   continue to close, and many of the strongest are said to be losing   money.
Steel orders have slowed somewhat, with lead times   shortening. Some companies say shipments will be relatively good in   January and. February, but March is doubtful. However, a leading   company is shipping at capacity and expects to continue to do so   through March.
General merchandise and specialty store sales surged   just before Christmas, helped by price cuts, and remained at a good   level into early January. In recent weeks, however, sales slipped   back. Several long-established chains are closing marginal stores.
Transportation. Railroad traffic, except for coal and grain, is   depressed. Newly-purchased freight cars are standing idle. Trucking   companies are experiencing intense competition under deregulation.   Rates are being discounted, and fluctuate daily. Many companies are   expected to fold up or merge with stronger firms. Operators facing   nonunion competition are expecting aggressive bargaining with the   Teamsters in 1982.
Home mortgage rates are quoted in the 14 1/2 to l6   1/2-percent range, but few customers apply. "Creative financing" takes many forms, for example, one-year rollover mortgages. Housing   starts in large district centers were off 70 to 90 percent in 1980   from the 1977-78 level, and virtually zero in some smaller towns.   The current picture suggests an even bleaker 1981 if rates do not   decline soon. Office building construction continues strong in   downtown Chicago with important new projects being started.
