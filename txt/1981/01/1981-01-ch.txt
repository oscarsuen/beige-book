Labor markets. New unemployment insurance claims remain at high   levels throughout the district. Help-wanted lineage in Chicago   papers was 40 percent below a year ago in the fourth quarter, and   January has been about as bad. Although computer programmers,   nurses, and certain other specialties are in short supply, demand   for workers, generally, is very weak. Some examples: (1) an   erroneous report that a Chicago-area major steel company was hiring   attracted several thousand people, who created a dangerous mob   scene; (2) an ad for bus drivers in Milwaukee brought a deluge of   applicants that overwhelmed interviewers; (3) a trucking company   reported a much improved supply of qualified drivers; (4) a bank in   a smaller Indiana city reported 60 applicants, two-thirds qualified,   for one clerical position paying $7,500. Companies interview many   people "overqualified" for available jobs. Quality of entry-level   job applicants in the larger cities, however, is deplorable.
High interest rates. Record high interest rates clearly are holding   back many types of activity. Loans of all types continue to be   available to creditworthy borrowers, in contrast to the situation   last spring. However, tighter lending criteria turn away increasing   numbers of marginal borrowers. More important, interest as a cost   has become an overriding consideration for many businesses, and   institutions. Car dealers are being forced out by "killing" floor   plan rates-22 1/2 percent, recently. High rates have kept   inventories abnormally low for many manufacturers, distributors, and   retailers. Some smaller manufacturers who had been expanding   steadily are deliberately shrinking their operations in order to   hold down interest costs. More larger firms are restricting outlays   to internally-generated funds. High rates paid for CDs are seriously   undermining many S&Ls, some of large size.
Transportation. Railroad traffic, except for coal and grain, is   depressed. Newly-purchased freight cars are standing idle. Trucking   companies are experiencing intense competition under deregulation.   Rates are being discounted, and fluctuate daily. Many companies are   expected to fold up or merge with stronger firms. Operators facing   nonunion competition are expecting aggressive bargaining with the   Teamsters in 1982.
