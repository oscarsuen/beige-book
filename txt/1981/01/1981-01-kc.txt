A majority of retailers continue to report negligible merchandise cost increases in recent months are reducing upward pressure on retail prices. Most retailers note recent downward pressure on profit margins because of increases in advertising expenditures, utility bills, and other operational expenses.
The recent weakness in total dollar sales leaves most retailers in the Tenth District with inventory levels that are slightly higher than desirable. However, none of the retailers report any plans for extra clearance sales in January or February. All retailers expect to continue past practices of tightly controlling inventory levels, through the first half of 1981.
Deposits at Tenth District banks were generally up during the past month with much of the increase in interest bearing deposits. Money market certificates show strong growth in response to the rise in yields. At the same time, some of the larger banks are beginning to run off large CD's. All banks contacted began offering NOW's and most report consumer response equal to or greater than projected. Most bankers feel that the bulk of the increase in NOW's is coming from existing demand deposits and from conversion of ATS accounts. Little new money is being attracted to these accounts because of relatively high minimum balances and service charges. Banks report some net outflow of funds in those areas with strong competition from savings institutions.
