Economic activity in the Second District continued mixed in February and early March. Retail sales increased at most stores, though a few merchants reported disappointing results. Domestic car sales picked up a bit at some dealers, due in large part to the rebate programs; foreign car sales also improved. Outside the consumer sector, economic activity appeared to be generally flat. Yet a number of respondents did indicate that their companies had experienced a modest improvement in business in recent weeks. Despite the stronger than expected performance of the national economy in the first quarter, the consensus forecast still calls for sluggish growth over 1981 as a whole. Many respondents expressed enthusiasm for the direction and substance of the new Administration's tax and expenditure proposals. None, however, indicated that the proposals had led them to change their own production and capital-spending plans.
Automobile sales in the Second District strengthened in recent weeks. To a large extent, however, the sales gains have been the result of the substantial rebates offered by domestic car makers. Yet sales of some imported cars also improved, and dealers in these cars anticipate further gains during the spring. Inventory positions vary greatly. Some were reported low because of the high cost of carrying inventories while others were described as adequate or high.
Kaufman: A double-dip in economic activity will not occur. Besides a much larger than expected increase in real GNP this quarter, the economic path for the balance of this year will include about 2 percent real growth in the second quarter and 3 to 4 percent for the second half of this year. The distinctive features of the continued expansion will include no cyclical support from housing, a big increase in defense expenditures, prudent business monetary practices (constrained by high interest rates) and renewed strength on corporate liquidity later this year when interest rates will reach new highs in the long term bond markets.
Schott: Prospects for disinflation, largely created by well-judged monetary policy, are being converted into reality. Progress will be slow because of the institutionalization of inflation. Yet, psychological factors have turned distinctly favorable for three reasons: (1) the Administration's expenditure control proposals have credibility, including prospects for Congressional acceptance; (2) Federal Reserve restraint has resulted in renewed liquidity pressures at intermediaries, which is reflected in cautious loan policies; and (3) the soft spots in the economy, such as housing, automobiles and farm machinery have created apprehensions about significant business failures. These apprehensions have dampened speculation.
Wojnilower: Current statistics and reports from business contacts suggest that the economy remains strong and that the Reagan program is prompting more expansionary planning by business firms. The decline in interest rates likely is setting up a repeat performance of last summer's acceleration of business and upsurge in interest rates-but this time it will be from a stronger base of business activity and without the caution induced by preceding credit stresses.
Indications are that longer term bond issues, initially by banks but probably followed by others, are accelerating sharply. Buying of such securities, however, remains limited largely to pension funds and to fiduciaries and speculators who expect to remain interested in the bond market only very briefly.
