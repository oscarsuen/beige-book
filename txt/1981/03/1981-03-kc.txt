Most Tenth District retailers report merchandise cost increases in early 1981 of 5-10 per cent in contrast to negligible increases in the last half of 1980. Recent increases in merchandise costs have put some downward pressure on profit margins as most retailers try to remain price competitive.
Nearly all Tenth District retailers report satisfaction with inventory levels during January and February of 1981, when improved sales lowered stock-to-sales ratios. While all retailers expect to watch those ratios closely to keep inventories in line, inventory purchasing is expected to increase slightly because most District retailers expect sales to continue to improve through 1981. In particular, second and third quarter sales are expected to be up appreciably compared to a year earlier when the credit restraint program was influencing sales in part of the period.
Deposits at Tenth District banks are generally rising, with much of this strength coming from money market certificates and NOW accounts. All banks contacted are currently offering NOW's and most report them to be quite successful. While demand deposits are generally down, most banks attribute this weakness to the advent of NOW accounts and seasonal factors. Most banks report that time deposits other than MMC's, and savings deposits other than NOW's, are either stable or declining. About one-half of the banks contacted are allowing their large CD's to run off as a result of weak loan demand. However, banks with strong loan demand are successfully marketing their large CD's.
