Reports from the Third District indicate that business activity for the month of March is sluggish to mixed. Area manufacturers say industrial activity is showing some signs of expansion in March but has remained basically unchanged for the third consecutive month. The continued stability in manufacturing activity may have put a halt, at least temporarily, to cuts in factory employment observed since last April. As for the future, manufacturers anticipate a sharp upswing within the next six months which may give labor a boost as well. Retail sales are up overall in March, but a mass transit strike in the Philadelphia metropolitan area has dropped sales in downtown stores 50 percent. Looking ahead, retailers are a bit more optimistic than they have been in recent months, anticipating increased sales by September. In the financial sector, area bankers report sluggish loan activity. Consumer loans are down from a year ago, while C&I loan volume is slightly better, but still not strong. In efforts to bolster business loan demand, many banks have increased below-prime lending activity and are offering fixed-rate loans to businesses that want them. In the coal industry, the Third District will feel some impact should the United Mine Workers call a general strike on March 27, as planned. Area utility companies and manufacturers appear ready, however, having stockpiled supplies that would last one to three months.
For the longer term, respondents to the survey continue to be optimistic, anticipating a sharp upswing in general industrial activity within the next six months. Over one-half of the survey participants expect new orders and shipments to grow between now and September, and, as production pick ups, manufacturers plan to increase factory payrolls and lengthen the average workweek a bit. Higher expenditures on plant and equipment are also forecast.
On the inflation front, industrial prices have jumped again in the Third District, as over one-half of the survey respondents report paying more for raw materials than they did last month, and about one-fifth say they are charging more for their finished products. Prices are expected to continue climbing, as 9 out of 10 of the survey participants anticipate higher input costs by September and nearly 8 out of 10 plan price hikes for the goods they sell.
Outside of the downtown area, March sales are up over last year's levels, about 7 to 10 percent, owing mainly to new spring lines and growing consumer confidence, according to area contacts. Sales of soft goods—apparel and small household items—continue to be strong, with big ticket items starting to pick-up as well.
As for the future, area retailers are a bit more optimistic about the second half of 1981 than they've been in recent months, expecting sales to run at least 3 percent above year-ago figures. According to some contacts, consumer confidence in the Reagan Administration is growing, as "they try to get a handle on inflation." Area retailers are keeping the lid on inventories, though, and plan no changes for stock levels, hoping to keep inventory-sales ratios healthy.
In an effort to bolster business loan demand, many banks have increased below-prime lending activity and are also offering fixed-rate loans to businesses that want them. Takers for fixed-rate loans may be scarce, though. One reason cited for the weak loan demand was that many businesses have put off borrowing for six months or so, when they expect interest rates to be significantly lower.
Third District bankers are currently quoting a prime rate of 17 1/2 percent. They, like area businessmen, expect the prime to continue to drop, leaving the rate 200 to 300 basis points below its current level by September.
Two developments have occurred since the last Redbook in the Third District financial sector. The first took place in Delaware where Governor Pete du Pont signed into law the Financial Center Development Act, eliminating all usury ceilings in the state, allowing variable rate consumer loans to be made, allowing banks to charge fees for the use of credit cards, and giving tax breaks to banks establishing operations in Delaware. Two major New York banks have already set plans in motion to move credit card operations to the state, and, although no major Philadelphia banks have announced definite intentions to follow suit, they are carefully examining the costs and benefits of doing so.
Also this month, in attempts to match the advantages offered to depositors by money market funds, a major mutual savings bank in Philadelphia started offering a six-month savings certificate with a floating rate that was to be tied to the six-month T- bill rate and change weekly. The $10,000 certificate was available to savers with at least $5,000, who could then borrow the balance from the bank. The certificate was pulled from the market after only one day, however, when the FDIC ruled that the terms violated a number of regulations. There were a few actual sales though, and those buyers were given a choice of converting to a conventional six-month money market certificate or taking a refund.
