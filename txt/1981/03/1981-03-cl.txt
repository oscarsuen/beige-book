Auto sales in this District picked up because of the recent rebate programs, which an industry economist estimates boosted new car sales 150,000 units nationally. A foreign car dealer reports a 12% increase in sales since the beginning of the year, but does not expect imports to gain market share during 1981. An auto economist notes that high interest rates have not deterred auto sales as much as expected, but have constrained dealer purchases and inventories. He cites a big shift in auto financing from banks and credit unions to auto finance companies, which are offering lower interest rates.
Housing starts are expected to fall below 1980's pace, according to a major area builder, with funds for speculative building virtually shut off at the present time. A bank economist reports that small builders are under severe financial strain and have contributed to bankruptcies among their subcontractors and to income problems of several area S&Ls that financed speculative building. A bank economist believes that mortgage rates may decline to 13% in the near future if the cost of funds continues to ease.
