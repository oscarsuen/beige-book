In February and early March, business activity in the Ninth District continued to be sluggish. General merchandise sales along with manufacturing investment and production continued to expand modestly; automobile sales were still poor, although they did rebound from January's very depressed level; taconite mining and lumber milling remained at January's low level; and home and winter recreational spending declined. In addition, price declines and drought continued to threaten agricultural producers. Reflecting these weaknesses was the continued sluggishness in bank lending.
