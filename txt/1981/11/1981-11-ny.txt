The sluggishness in the Second District became more widespread during October. The retail sector worsened, as department store gains tapered off and automobile dealers reported bleak conditions. Manufacturing industries remained depressed. Our directors reported a sharp deterioration in business conditions nationwide, with the weakening spreading beyond housing and autos to basic industries in general and retail sales across-the-board. On the financial side, demand for business loans was high due to cash shortages and a poor bond market.
Automobile sales slumped in October as rebate and interest rate subsidy programs expired. Even the previously strong market for used cars showed some signs of weakening. Floor traffic has dwindled as potential buyers worry about uncertainty in the economic outlook and high interest costs. Dealers attempting to minimize carrying charges are paring inventories and reducing factor orders. No improvement is anticipated before January, as the holiday months of November and December traditionally are slow.
Stringent control of inventories was widespread. Two companies have trimmed raw materials supplies, while others are tightening inventories of work-in-progress. Desire for cuts in stocks of finished goods was expressed, but in some cases slow sales have prevented a rapid adjustment to lower levels. Despite slow activity, some businesses seem reluctant to curb capital spending, but others emphasized only sluggishness ahead.
Plans for sizable layoffs by a major upstate manufacturer of office equipment suggest that unemployment in some localities may jump. Many concerns are relying on attrition and careful hiring practices to hold employment down. Poor economic conditions have moderated wage increases for firms not locked into pre-existing contracts.
O'Leary: Virtually all of the economic indicators are now confirming that general business activity is worsening. High interest rates are biting. Federal Reserve policy is on the right course. There is room for the authorities to encourage a stronger rate of increase in M1B and a continuing decline of short-term rates. But such a move should be carried out with great care so that it will be perceived as being within the framework of maintaining a "steady" policy position and not one that aggressively expands money supply to head off a serious recession. I anticipate a further significant decline of short-term rates in the next few months, which would be healthy if it does not go too far as it did during the second quarter of 1980. It would surprise me, however, if long-term rates declined very much in any lasting way during the next several months due to the fact that the supply of funds for the purchase of long-term, fixed-rate bonds and mortgages is not apt to be large enough to satisfy the huge backed-up demands for such financing.
Riefler: A marked shift in sentiment has occurred and we now expect negative real growth for at least this quarter. Recovery may be slow because long-term interest rates will probably remain quite high in relation to underlying conditions. The Fed should continue its current policy along gradual easing of short-term ratesâ€”any abrupt changes could be counter-productive by arousing fears of a rapid reversal such as was witnessed in the fall of 1980 and the spring of this year.
