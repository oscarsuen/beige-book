The availability of credit does not appear to be a significant problem at most District banks, and credit from agricultural merchants and dealers continues to be available in most areas. However, concern is being expressed over the creditworthiness of borrowers. Persistent low commodity prices, for both crops and livestock, coupled with the high cost of borrowing leads to continuing repayment difficulties for farmers. District bankers estimate that in 1982 the number of agricultural customers no longer creditworthy will be twice as large as in a normal year.
Deposit growth at Tenth District banks remained sluggish in the past month, despite the introduction al the all-savers certificates. Volume on these certificates is reported as mixed. New money comprised 17 to 30 percent of the total, with the remainder of the funds for the all-savers certificates usually coming from a different account within the same bank. Demand deposits, and consumer time and savings deposits subject to fixed ceiling rates, declined in most areas. NOW accounts, money market certificates, and small saver certificates at most banks displayed stable growth. Large CD growth is up in most areas, particularly those where the level of economic activity is high.
