Economic activity in the Eighth District remains sluggish. Current-dollar retail sales have tended to be stable over the past month with declining auto sales being offset somewhat by increased sales on other consumer items. Home construction dropped again in September, and this pattern appears to have continued through October. Representatives of financial institutions report some increase in total time and savings deposits as a result of All-Savers Certificates. Manufacturing activity remains steady with no significant changes in output reported. Agricultural output in the District is very good with production of most crops running well above 1980 levels.
Other components of consumer spending appear to have increased in October. Department store representatives reported dollar sales increases up to 6 percent over the previous month. Clothing and electronic products continue to lead the sales list, and retailers report that sales of major appliances are holding steady. Nevertheless, all retailers reported that unit sales were down as compared with the previous year and that dollar sales continue to fall short of the level they had anticipated earlier this year.
S&L's continue to be reluctant to make new mortgage loans. Mortgage rates on new conventional 80 percent loans range up to 19 percent plus substantial closing costs. However, some S&Lofficials reported that. they are making some FHA and VA Loans at 16.5 percent plus points.
Area financial institutions report some increases in total time and savings deposits primarily resulting from the introduction of All-Savers Certificates. The financial institutions surveyed reported that net new deposits from All-Saver Certificates ranged from 5 to 25 percent. One S&L representative reported that only 15 percent of the All-Savers accounts which were transferred from other accounts came from passbook savings. Demand deposits at Eighth District reporting commercial banks have declined about 9.5 percent in the first three weeks in October.
