Deteriorating economic conditions appear to be spreading, and most respondents do not anticipate a recovery before spring, according to this month's District reports. Exceptions are energy, non-residential construction, defense, recreation, and some high technology firms. Real consumer spending has slipped, and the outlook for Christmas sales is mixed. New car sales declined sharply in October, and the depressed housing market continues to slump. Declines in manufacturing and employment are spreading, but inventory levels are generally not reported to be excessive. Bumper crops are in prospect, and farm incomes are depressed. Demand for most loans has slowed, but business borrowing is up in some districts. Concerns about a continued deterioration in the quality of loan portfolios are cited.
New car sales declined sharply in October after the rebate and incentive programs expired. High prices and interest rates, a lack of new models, and consumer caution are primary reasons cited for why auto sales are not likely to improve soon.
Nonresidential construction remains active in the Dallas District and is holding up reasonably well in Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta. Chicago and San Francisco report postponements in some projects.
Most factory inventories appear to be within manageable limits, although semiconductor firms in California are planning shutdowns to reduce inventories, and steel producers in the Cleveland District are liquidating stocks. Cleveland and Minneapolis note businesses are financing unplanned inventories. Richmond reports some buildups of finished goods, but Chicago indicates "pipelines are virtually empty" in various wholesale markets.
Demand for labor is softening, as evidenced by increased layoffs and reductions in hours worked. Two exceptions are St. Louis where total employment rose and Atlanta where increased demand for high-technology and communications workers continues. Chicago indicates the demand for workers may be at the lowest level since the 1930's, and many employers are seeking substantial concessions when renewing labor contracts.
Rising delinquency rates and business borrowings to finance interest payments on prior loan commitments are causing concern for bankers in Cleveland. Signs of growing financial strain are also noted by Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Richmond cites increasing financial difficulties among auto dealers, farm machinery and equipment dealers, construction firms, and wholesalers.
Deposit growth is generally sluggish. Sales of all-savers certificates, although below expectations, were strong initially but generally fell off in mid-October. However, Atlanta indicates growth in these certificates at thrifts remained rapid, and Boston and Philadelphia note renewed growth in sales. Estimates of new funds in those deposits ranged from 5 to 50 percent.
