Economic activity appears to have slowed in the Sixth District in October. Retailers' sales have weakened. The outlook for housing remains depressed, and foreclosures of builders and real estate firms have become more common. Industrial expansion continues for the District's high technology companies while other industries have registered little growth or are cutting back operations. Inventories are being kept quite lean. Bank lending has been anemic, businessmen seem wary of the volatile interest rate situation. Yield prospects for the District's late-growing crops have been further reduced due to continued dry weather.
Apparently, the incentive programs offered by the auto dealers have lost their effectiveness. New car sales have been extremely slow throughout the District. Most dealers were not optimistic about near-term prospects.
Severe financial stress in the thrift industry persists. Growth of the small savers certificates has been rapid and there is evidence that the all savers certificate is lowering the cost of funds to the thrifts. Nevertheless, savings and loans have continued to borrow extensively from the Federal Home Loan Bank. The latest information from the Fourth Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta shows that advances to Georgia savings and loan associations were up 30 percent in September from September of last year.
Business loan demand has remained low in most of the District. Some bankers attribute softness in loan demand to cut-rate loans offered by auto companies. Businessmen are skeptical of the recent drop in short-term interest rates. The high costs of carrying inventories has caused most businesses to keep their inventory levels at an absolute minimum.
The employment outlook for the Atlanta area is mixed at this time. Our survey of 14 of metropolitan Atlanta's largest employers gives some insight into recent economic conditions and prospects for the immediate future. It appears that the heavy durable goods industries (automobile assembly, cable manufacturing, aircraft manufacturing) have limited hiring plans at best for the near term. The service industries contacted report no hiring plans at the present time. In contrast, the high technology and communications industries are growing at a rapid pace. A manufacturer of satellite earth stations and communications equipment has added 1,200 employees in the past 12 months and is still hiring. A manufacturer of word processing equipment has also had dramatic employment gains recently.
The tourism industry is beginning to show signs of improvement following the usual post-Labor Day slowdown. Opryland in Nashville expects to equal or come close to its 1978 attendance, which was a banner year; hotel occupancies are up four percent from last year. Hotels and motels throughout Florida are receiving advance bookings for the winter season. Airlines also report heavy bookings. Because of the forced cutback of flights due to the air traffic controllers' strike, airlines are fully utilizing wide-body equipment to assure more seats in the Florida market than last year. In south west Florida, less expensive family hotels are full while large, expensive hotels have some vacancies-reflecting the fact thatvisitors to that part of the state are vacationing on a more modest budget.
