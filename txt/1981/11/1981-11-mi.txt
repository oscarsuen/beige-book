Business conditions in the Ninth District were sluggish again in October, as they have been since mid-summer. Consumer spending on durable goods, homes, and autos continued to be weak. Industrial activity also continued to be weak, particularly in manufacturing, forest products, and taconite mining. Agricultural conditions once again were not favorable to farmers. Reflecting this sluggishness in the district's business activity, demand for loans at the district's banks remained at a low level.
Consumers also continued to be very reluctant to purchase homes and autos in October. Home sales, as indicated by mortgage loan applications at Minneapolis-St. Paul S&Ls, remained very depressed, as they have been since last spring. New car sales, according to regional sales managers for domestic automobile manufacturers, remained at September's very depressed level.
As manufacturing activity declined, so did activity in the depressed forest products and iron mining industries. According to directors, layoffs occurred at taconite plants in northeastern Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan during October. These layoffs were in addition to the layoffs that were announced in September. In Minnesota, almost 20 percent of the state's iron ore workers are now unemployed. The lumber mills in western Montana that were closed last month remained closed, and several lumber mills in northeastern Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were also closed in October, according to directors.
Confirming this slowdown in industrial activity was the recent rise in initial claims for unemployment insurance. Minnesota's initial claims, seasonally adjusted, increased 20 percent between September and October.
One bright spot is that the district's farmers expect bumper crops. This year's corn harvest is estimated to be 22 percent larger than last year's, and the soybean crop is estimated to be 6 percent larger than it was last year.
