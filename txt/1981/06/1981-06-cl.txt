Savings flows into S&Ls may fall as sharply in June as in April, according to an economist for a regional FHLB in the District. An S&L that has benefited from a promotion to attract funds to their six-month money-market certificate in May reports that competition from other S&Ls and higher rates offered by commercial banks have reduced savings flows in June. Several S&L officials see little relief from their earnings problem this quarter or next. Losses this quarter will apparently be even more widespread than last, which will aggravate those associations that have already been operating with relatively low liquidity. An S&L official asserts that the proposed tax-free savings certificate would promptly improve the supply of and demand for mortgages, although several others feel such an instrument would be too late to benefit this selling season.
