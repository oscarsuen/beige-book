Although sluggishness persists in the Ninth District, signs of improvement occurred in May and early June. The signs of improvement were many:
Consumer spending, particularly for merchandise, continued the       improvement it began in April.
Industrial activity improved as suggested by an increase in       manufacturing firms' new orders and by the settlement of       construction strikes.
Late spring rains have improved growing conditions, and crops are       off to a good start.
Despite these improvements, farm prices and auto sales in May and   early June were disappointing after showing signs of improvement in   April, and mining and lumbering remain weak. These weaknesses   continue to be reflected in sluggish bank lending.
This pickup in spending, however, does not extend to autos and   homes. A regional sales manager for a domestic automobile   manufacturer indicated that in May and early June, car sales   returned to their depressed pre-rebate levels after improving in   April. Home sales did not drop, but did not improve; mortgage loan   applications at Minneapolis-St. Paul S&Ls in May and early June were   unchanged from April's depressed level.
In contrast to the improvement in manufacturing and construction,   mining and lumbering remain in the doldrums. A Montana director   indicated that the forest products industry in western Montana   continues to operate at 60 percent of capacity. Similarly, in   northeastern Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, some   iron ore mines remain closed and others are operating only part of   the time.
