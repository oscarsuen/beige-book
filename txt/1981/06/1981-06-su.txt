According to this month's district reports, economic activity in the nation remains mixed. Agriculture probably offers the most consistent observations, with most districts indicating bright prospects for crop yields and farm prices later in 1981. The construction industry is in the doldrums for the most part, with residential building still not showing any real life, and commercial construction beginning to lose its momentum. Manufacturing remains soft in many areas, but reports from Minneapolis and Dallas hold some hope for the industrial sector. Factory inventories are generally in good shape. Retail trade is one of the brightest spots on the economic horizon at this time, with sales running well ahead of the June 1980 levels in most districts, and ahead of most projections as well. Auto sales remain a blemish, though. Financial institutions continue to show very little, if any, loan growth and are experiencing deposit flow problems as well.
Commercial construction is generally stronger than residential, but it too has started to show some signs of tailing off. Commercial building continues to move at a good clip in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas, but has started to soften in Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco. High rates are said to be responsible in part for the dropback. Many of the projects already in progress when credit conditions were initially tightened are now reaching completion but are not being replaced with new ones, as developers are scared off by high financing charges and economic uncertainty.
Auto sales are almost universally very, very soft. Sales in many districts are only slightly ahead of last year's depressed levels, remaining well below the prosperous volume of 1978.
Deposit flow problems are mentioned in a number of reports and seem to be especially acute in the Twelfth District where there has been an increased call for legislative action allowing thrifts and banks to more effectively compete with money market funds.
