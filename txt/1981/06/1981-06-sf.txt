The consensus in the Twelfth District is for a weakening in the economy. Most are forecasting a continued decline in consumer spending. Consumers are especially hesitant to buy large items. The unemployment and inflation picture in the region is following the national trend. Unemployment rates have edged upward, while the inflation rate has slowed. With housing, energy, and food prices leading the way, very optimistic short-run inflation expectations are being expressed. Little activity is occurring in the housing market. Mortgage rates are still high, up to 18 percent, and consumers are hesitant to obtain adjustable rate mortgages. Agriculture continues strong and many areas are reporting good harvests. Financial institutions are increasingly troubled by the outflow of deposits to money market funds. It is felt that the current regulations are inequitable and that the restrictions need to be immediately loosened so that banks and thrifts can better compete with other institutions offering financial services.
