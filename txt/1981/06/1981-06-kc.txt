Current stocks of merchandise at District retail stores are satisfactory relative to recent sales growth. However, most retailers expect sales to level off in the third quarter of this year. Inventory levels will, therefore, be watched closely in coming months. A majority of Tenth District retailers expect sales to pick up in the fourth quarter of 1981. Any buildup of inventories in the third quarter will then be used to ensure merchandise availability later in the year.
Range and pasture conditions throughout the District have improved due to recent rainfall, but additional moisture is necessary to maintain the rangeland in good condition.
Growth of deposits at most Tenth District banks is weak or moderate and concentrated in 6-month money market certificates. A number of banks are offering retail RP's to attract funds, due in part to intense competition from money market mutual funds. Several other banks are considering offering retail RP's in the near future.
