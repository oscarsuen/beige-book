Respondents in the Twelfth District report further weakness in the regional economy and express less optimism that significant improvement will occur before mid-1982. Consumer spending is slowing, except for automobiles, leading to an unwanted buildup of inventory. Unemployment has been falling in most District states, but because of a decline in the labor force rather than growth in jobs. In fact, weakness is developing in certain key industries—such as aerospace—where employment had been stable. District homebuilding is in the doldrums, and sales and permit activity point to a further decline. Agricultural prices have been dropping, partly due to slow overseas demand. Commercial loan demand is increasing, but because of business cash flow problems rather than improved conditions. Mortgage lending activity at financial institutions is virtually nonexistent, with rates for conventional loans now as high as 19 percent. Savings and loan associations continue to experience a sharp decline in deposits, but it is unknown whether this movement is being offset by a shift to retail repurchase agreements.
