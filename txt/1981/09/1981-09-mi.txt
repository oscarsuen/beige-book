The Ninth District's economy was lackluster in August and early September, despite some positive developments. The positive developments were good tourist spending, strong oil and gas exploration and production, and good growing weather. But more than offsetting these positive developments were depressed levels of consumer spending on general merchandise, automobiles, and homes; a drop-off in manufacturing orders; cutbacks in output of forest products and mining companies; and weak farm prices. The overall weakness in the district's economy was reflected in a continuing slackness in bank lending.
The only positive development, according to directors, is that the late summer tourist and travel business in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, northern Minnesota, and Montana has been good.
The depressed forest products and iron mining industries have sunk further into the doldrums. Because of weak demand for building products, one large forest products company recently closed three mills in western Montana. Also, Minnesota's largest Iron Range taconite plant announced in mid-September that it was cutting its output by 40 percent.
Energy exploration and production has been the one bright spot in industrial activity. One Montana director, for example, states that 10 to 12 oil leases in his county alone in the last 60 days have provided considerable economic stimulus.
To the disappointment of district farmers, however, agricultural prices have dropped. Since July, cash grain and livestock prices at Minneapolis and South St. Paul have either remained the same or declined.
