Higher auto sales since the August rebates have reduced inventories substantially, according to some area auto dealers. However, an economist with an auto producer reports that sales in September were well below their expectations. Even though inventories were reduced in recent weeks, dealers are unlikely to build stocks of 1982 models because of sluggish sales and high cost of floor plans. He expects a 5.7 million annual rate of sales for at least the next two quarters, with little prospects for recovery until the second round of tax reductions next summer. A local dealer reports that dealer margins have held steady because of less willingness to negotiate price. An import dealer reports a well-balanced 30-day supply of new cars.
S&Ls continues to be hard pressed by heavy outflows of funds, despite some success in attracting funds away from banks through repurchase agreements, jumbo CDs, and 30-month certificates. Losses in passbook accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market certificates have more than offset gains from repos, according to an economist for a regional FHLB in the District. September outflows are expected to be worse than August, but not as bad as the near-record losses in July. Several respondents expect the "all savers" certificate to improve the cost position of S&Ls, along with the recent decline in interest rates. Nevertheless, a sharp step-up in merger activity is expected over the next few quarters.
