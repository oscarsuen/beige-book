Crop condition reports from District bankers are consistent with USDA estimates of a record corn crop and near record soybean crop. Because of late plantings, both corn and soybeans are still susceptible to a hard, early frost in some areas. Due to the depressing effect of large crop supplies on market prices, more farmers are expected to participate in government grain reserve programs this year.
Deposit growth has increased moderately in areas of the Tenth District affected by energy-related investment spending and has been flat in other parts of the District. In all areas of the Tenth District, growth in deposits is concentrated in large CD's and money market and small saver certificates; little or no growth is occurring in other deposit categories. A few banks are paying less than the ceiling rate on small saver certificates.
The majority of bankers do not expect the volume of all-savers certificates to be substantial. They think the bulk of these funds will come from current deposits, especially money market certificates. Bank respondents expect the all-saver certificates to marginally decrease their aggregate cost of funds, and to have almost no impact on lending rates, including mortgage rates.
