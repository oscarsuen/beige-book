Area business representatives report that economic activity in the Eighth District has remained sluggish and generally unchanged over the past month. Retailers report a mixed pattern of consumer spending. Sales of apparel and other nondurables are up, while sales of household appliances are generally down. Home construction has fallen from the low levels of the previous month. Representatives of financial institutions report no major changes in either loans or deposits from the previous month. Manufacturing activity appears mixed. Area manufacturers of shoes, textiles, carpet, oil-related products and military equipment report strong sales, while sales of building materials, household appliances and primary metals are weak. The outlook for agricultural output in the Eighth District is good.
Real estate loans declined somewhat over the last two weeks. S&L officials have indicated a reluctance to make new mortgage loans. S&Ls lending activity appears to be aimed at shortening the maturity of their loan portfolio. Most S&Ls are offering loans at below market interest rates on homes on which they hold the mortgage; however, several S&L officials indicated that even this loan activity is light.
Deposits of financial institutions have remained fairly steady over the past month. Area commercial banks report modest increases of demand deposits and a general leveling off in the outflow from passbook accounts. S&Ls report a continued, and perhaps accelerating, outflow from passbook savings. Some S&Ls have been able to offset passbook deposit losses with high interest rate deposits which can be converted to "All-Savers Certificates" at the depositor's option. S&L officials continue to be optimistic about the prospects for "All-Saver Certificates."
