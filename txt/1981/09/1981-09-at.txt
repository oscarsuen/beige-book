High interest rates continue to undermine seriously the financial stability for a number of Sixth District businesses. The home building sector remains depressed and the forest products industry is on the brink of a major phase-down. Economic problems have caused an acceleration in savings and loan mergers. Positive developments are spotty, with an uptick in retail sales and expansion in the high-technology industries notable bright spots.
Auto dealers say that promotions offering below market financing rates have stimulated new domestic car sales somewhat. Nonparticipating agencies reported declines in sales. All dealers contacted expressed a belief that conditions were unlikely to improve over the next three to six months.
One response to the high cost of funds and weak loan demand has been an increase in savings and loan mergers in the District as across the country. In Georgia, a Gainesville savings and loan and one in Savannah formed a holding company that plans to expand statewide. One of Georgia's largest associations also plans to merge with three others in the state to reach combined assets approaching $1.4 billion. A Miami-based association will combine with one in New York and California to form the largest savings and loan association in the nation. In an attempt to maintain their loan volume, some District financial institutions are seeking loans outside their immediate lending area.
Brisk activity in office and industrial construction continues throughout most of the District; however, softness in the rental market for office space is anticipated in a number of areas as buildings that were just starting up when interest rates began to soar reach completion. This softness is expected to be only temporary.
Tourism traffic in Florida appears to have fallen far short of expectations. The southwest region of the state had its slowest season in ten years, off almost 25 percent from last year. At the Port of Miami, cancellations of cruise reservations are growing and attendance at major central Florida attractions has been down significantly from year-ago figures. Business lenders hope that the recently completed $300 million futuristic Orlando Airport will help boost the central Florida tourist industry.
On a brighter note, clusters of high-technology companies are emerging in the District. Expansion has been rapid in southern Florida with its economic ties to the Kennedy Space Center and at Huntsville, Alabama, site of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Marshall Space Flight Center. Technology Park in Atlanta has attracted more than 40 high-tech firms to the area.
Atlanta-area employers predict an improved employment outlook for the next three months, according to a recent survey by a temporary help firm. Openings are expected mostly in the service industries.
Quick action in Florida on the Medfly problem now appears to have averted damage to the state's crops.
