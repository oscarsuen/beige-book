The Twelfth District economy expanded at a moderate pace during the survey period of March through mid-April.  Overall price inflation was modest and wage pressures eased in some industries, although wage increases remained significant for workers with specialized skills in selected sectors.  Retailers reported moderate sales gains on net, with robust gains reported for service providers.  Manufacturers reported mixed conditions, while sales grew further for agricultural producers.  Housing markets cooled further in most areas, but activity in commercial real estate markets continued to pick up.  District banks saw solid growth in loan demand with the exception of residential mortgages.
Growth in labor compensation remained moderate overall.  Previously tight labor market conditions in the construction and agricultural sectors eased, partly alleviating the upward wage pressures in those sectors.  However, shortages continued for workers with specialized skills in various sectors and in areas with especially tight labor markets, notably Hawaii, Idaho, and Utah, keeping compensation growth rapid for these worker groups.
Most service providers saw robust demand, with especially strong sales for providers of food and beverage and health-care services.  Travel and tourism activity was brisk in key District locales, with high hotel occupancy rates reported in the broad Southern California region.  However, hotel occupancy rates in Hawaii during the spring break period were down relative to the very high levels of the past few years, continuing the trend towards lower occupancy rates established earlier this year.
