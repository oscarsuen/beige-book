The economy of the Eighth District expanded modestly in the period since our previous report.  Manufacturing activity continued to soften, while in most industries the services sector continued to expand.  Reports from retailers and auto dealers of sales in February and March were mostly positive.  Home sales continued to be mixed across the District, while commercial real estate market conditions continued to improve.  Total loans at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks increased slightly in the three-month period ending in March.

A contact in the electronic product industry reported plans to hire additional workers.  In contrast, contacts in the electrical equipment, furniture, apparel, food, and auto parts industries announced plans to close plants or lay off workers in the District.

February and March sales of clothing were cited as particularly strong when compared with year-earlier sales.  In contrast, several durable goods and big box retailers reported sales ranging from flat to down.  Car dealers reported that sales in February and March increased, on average, compared with year-ago levels.  Sales of used cars were particularly strong.

Contacts reported that a large automobile plant is set to be constructed near Tupelo, Mississippi, and that a large industrial park is planned in west Memphis.
Total loans outstanding at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks increased 0.2 percent in the three-month period ending in March 2007.  Real estate lending, which makes up 74.9 percent of total loans, increased 0.4 percent.  Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 17.0 percent of total loans, increased 0.7 percent.

Farmers in the Eighth District reported that they expect to plant 20 percent more acres of corn, 76 percent more acres of sorghum, and 5 percent more acres of tobacco this year than in 2006.  In contrast, they anticipate planting 11 percent fewer acres of soybeans, 30 percent fewer acres of cotton, and 12 percent fewer acres of rice than last year.  This year's total winter wheat acreage increased by 25 percent from last year, and at least 85 percent of each District state's crop was reported to be in fair or better condition.  However, subfreezing temperatures in the District over the Easter weekend left winter wheat crops especially vulnerable.  At least three-fourths of the pastures in each District state were reported to be in fair or better condition.
