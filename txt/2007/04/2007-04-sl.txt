The economy of the Eighth District expanded modestly in the period since our previous report.  Manufacturing activity continued to soften, while in most industries the services sector continued to expand.  Reports from retailers and auto dealers of sales in February and March were mostly positive.  Home sales continued to be mixed across the District, while commercial real estate market conditions continued to improve.  Total loans at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks increased slightly in the three-month period ending in March.
The District's services sector continued to expand in most areas.  Firms in the distribution, water transportation, and administrative and support services industries reported plans to build new facilities and hire additional workers.  In contrast, a contact in the data processing industry announced plans to lay off workers.  Reports from retailers have been mostly positive since our previous report.  February and March sales of clothing were cited as particularly strong when compared with year-earlier sales.  In contrast, several durable goods and big box retailers reported sales ranging from flat to down.  Car dealers reported that sales in February and March increased, on average, compared with year-ago levels.  Sales of used cars were particularly strong.
Commercial real estate markets have remained relatively strong throughout the District.  Contacts in west Tennessee reported the commercial real estate market is gaining strength.  Contacts in south central Kentucky reported that commercial construction is strong, particularly in the Bowling Green area.  Contacts in central Arkansas reported that large commercial contractors have a significant backlog of work for the remainder of 2007.  In Louisville, commercial contractors indicated that the volume of work on the market for bids is high and that the strong development in the downtown area continues.  Contacts reported that a large automobile plant is set to be constructed near Tupelo, Mississippi, and that a large industrial park is planned in west Memphis.
