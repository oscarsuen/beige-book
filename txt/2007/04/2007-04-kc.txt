The Tenth District economy expanded moderately in March and early April.  Consumer spending rebounded after slowing earlier in the year, and labor markets expanded solidly.  Agricultural conditions also improved, and commercial real estate activity increased.  On the other hand, residential real estate remained weak, growth in manufacturing activity slowed, and energy activity eased slightly.  Wage pressures edged higher, and many materials prices also increased.  However, retail price pressures generally remained modest.
