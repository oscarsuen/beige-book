On net, reports point to a slight increase in employment levels across the District.  Staffing firms reported positive trends in job openings over the past six weeks and on a year-over-year basis; however, the number of job seekers appears to have declined year-over-year.  Although openings are found across all industries, the greatest demand was seen in health care, IT, and accounting.  With the exception of energy-related businesses, wage pressures are largely contained.  Most manufacturers, commercial builders, and coal producers reported that input prices, especially for metals, are rising.
Almost all manufacturers reported that capital expenditures were on plan since mid February with more than half of the respondents saying they plan to increase spending in the next 12 months.  Of this latter group, several are planning aggressive expenditures which will include plant expansions; however, some spending will be outside the District or country.  A majority of producers reported a rise in input prices--particularly for metals--over the past six weeks.  Several attributed the increase to global demand.  In response, about half of our contacts said they increased their prices or used surcharges to pass through increased costs.  Most were successful except in the auto and housing markets.  About a third of our contacts reported a small increase in employment during the past six weeks including some who recalled laid-off workers.  Hiring in the near future is expected to be slow with only a third saying they plan to add workers.  Wage pressures are largely contained.
