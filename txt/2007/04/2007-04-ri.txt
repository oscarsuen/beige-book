Fifth District economic activity expanded at a slower pace since our last report.  Services firms generally continued to report moderate revenue growth, though the overall pace eased a bit.  Retail sales were flat, on balance, with most categories slowing.  Manufacturing activity continued to slip, with shipments, new orders and capacity utilization edging lower in recent weeks.  Lending activity at financial institutions slowed somewhat, though several contacts suggested that firms couldn't find enough skilled workers to expand.  There were only scattered reports of increases in loan delinquencies and late payments, but a few lenders suggested that tax refunds had provided only temporary relief.  Housing markets were generally weaker, though pockets of strength remained.  Commercial real estate markets remained solid, despite some concerns about the sustainability of demand going forward.  District labor markets continued to be tight, and the demand for workers was expected to remain strong in coming months.  Wages grew moderately.  Price pressures were mixed, with the pace of manufacturing prices ticking up, but services prices showing only modest growth.  In agriculture, a cold snap in April hurt the peach crop substantially and dented the prospects for other crops.
Commercial real estate agents reported little change in leasing activity since our last report, as demand for commercial space remained strong.  However, one contact in Washington, D.C., noted a slowdown in retail leasing.  Contacts generally reported little change in new commercial construction.  In contrast, a Northern Virginia contact said that the construction of office space continued and he expressed concern about the sustainability of the demand for the space.  He expressed surprise that rents remained steady in the face of an "overbuilt" market.  Vacancy rates were little changed across the District.
