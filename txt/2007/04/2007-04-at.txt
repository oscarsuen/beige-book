Reports from District contacts indicated, on balance, that business activity continued to expand modestly in March and the first half of April.  Retail sales increased while auto sales remained mixed.  Reports on the tourism and hospitality industry were generally positive.  Residential home sales and construction continued to decline in most areas, most notably in Florida.  In contrast, commercial construction exceeded year-ago levels in much of the District.  Factory activity was mixed, with sluggishness reported in industries linked to residential housing and strength noted for defense contractors.  Labor markets remained relatively tight, with continuing shortages of skilled workers in parts of the District.  Price increases for some commodities and building supplies slowed, but several contacts noted that fuel, labor, and insurance costs were accelerating.  Drought and freezing temperatures damaged District crops in the early spring.
District car sales continued to be mixed, with strong sales reports coming from import brand dealers while domestic brands lagged.  Two major import distributors reported strong demand for fuel-efficient and economy models, which offset weaker performance from trucks and SUVs.
Existing home sales in the District were slightly weaker on a year-over-year basis.  The majority of Realtors contacted anticipated that home sales will remain below year-ago levels over the next several months.
Reports from District commercial real estate contacts indicated that the pace of development during the first quarter exceeded year-ago levels.  Most noted that backlogs were equal to or greater than at the same time last year.  While some weakness was noted by several Florida contacts, the outlook among commercial developers in other parts of the District was mostly positive.
District transportation contacts reported weak freight demand in March through mid-April.  A major regional rail company noted lower automobile and housing-related shipments.
Prices for some building supplies declined during March and early April, whereas gasoline prices spiked higher.  Several small service firms cited increased pressure to raise prices because of factors such as higher labor, fuel, health insurance, and property insurance costs.
Contacts reported that demand was very high for oil and gas service companies in the Gulf area, as deepwater exploration and new production remained high priorities for the major producers.
