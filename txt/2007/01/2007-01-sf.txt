Much of the growth in labor compensation during this survey period was reported to be in non-base-wage components such as bonuses and commissions and employer-provided health-care benefits.  Contacts indicated that compensation growth was considerably higher for select groups of skilled workers, notably in the health-care, finance, and technology sectors, and in areas with very tight labor markets, such as Idaho and Utah, than it was overall.
Most service providers saw strong demand.  Sales were brisk in the food and beverage, health-care, and technology services sectors.  Tourist activity remained at high levels in most major markets.  In Hawaii, total tourist visits and spending were up compared to a year ago, despite declines in the number of Japanese visitors during the survey period.  In most parts of the District, hotel occupancy rates remained stable, while room rates rose further.
