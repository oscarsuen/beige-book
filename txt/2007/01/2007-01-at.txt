Vehicle sales were reportedly below year-ago levels in most areas.  South Florida dealers' noted disappointing traffic and sales during late November and December.  Sales of Florida's two best-selling domestic trucks were said to be down sharply from year-ago levels, while sales of foreign brands continued to advance.  One regional industry contact reported that sales of trucks and SUVs were boosted by incentives and lower gasoline prices.  Meanwhile, two regional import distributors reported slight gains across vehicle segments.
Nonresidential development in the District remained at healthy levels, with infrastructure repairs and improvements continuing to dominate activity in late November and December.  Reports from contacts indicated that District commercial real estate markets improved late in the year as office occupancy and rental rates increased.
Trucking contacts reported that business conditions remained weak in late November and December, mainly because of fewer shipping orders from building materials producers.  However, rail shipments continued to grow with shipments of inter-modal containers and coal offset lower shipments of autos and building materials.
Prices for some construction supplies continued to decline in December.  For instance, contacts noted that the cost of concrete, steel, copper, and framing lumber are all down from recent highs.  However, it was also noted that prices were well above the levels experienced two years ago.  Gulf Coast contacts reported that construction costs had not declined as much as other areas because of strong local demand.  Also, contacts in coastal areas continued to express concern about rising residential and commercial property insurance costs.  Retailers reported that strong competition continued to limit price increases on most goods.  On the other hand, several contacts in service-providing industries noted that they had successfully passed on cost increases to their customers.
