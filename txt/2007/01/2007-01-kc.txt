A majority of retail stores reported that sales were flat or declined from the previous survey and sales were below expectation.  However, retailers reported that overall sales were unchanged compared to a year ago and restaurants and shopping malls reported sales gains.  Mall respondents reported strength in jewelry but weakness in shoe sales.  Growth in overall holiday sales in the Rocky Mountain region appeared to be depressed by recent blizzards.  Heavy snow also interrupted mountain transportation in late December, although holiday travel and tourism activity remained solid overall.  District hotels continued to report high occupancy rates, particularly in resort areas.  A significant number of automobile and retail establishments expected sales to increase through the first quarter.  Many furniture and appliance retailers expected inventories to decline while a significant number of automobile dealers expected inventories to rise modestly.  Most hotel and mall operators expected high levels of activity to continue over the coming months. Manufacturing Growth at district manufacturers edged down in December and early January, though plant managers expected activity to rise in the future.  Plant managers reported slower growth in production, employment, and shipments.  However, some manufacturers reported that new orders rose in December, and capital expenditures were above year-ago levels.  In the wake of ice storms in western Nebraska some manufacturers limited production to conserve power.  Plant managers were optimistic about future activity.  An increasing share of respondents expected increases in production, employment, capital expenditures, shipments, and export orders and declines in finished goods inventories. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate activity continued to decrease in December and early January, while commercial real estate activity remained solid.  Home sales declined and inventories remained above year-ago levels.  Respondents reported weakness concentrated in the higher-priced segment with some strength in lower-priced homes.  Builders indicated that home starts remained weak.  Overall home prices were unchanged from a month ago and remained below year-ago levels.  Expectations for sales were mixed, with some respondents anticipating declining prices in the coming months and others basing optimism on lower interest rates and a positive economic outlook.  Commercial real estate sales were largely unchanged from a month ago.  However, absorption of office space increased in most cities, and vacancy rates throughout the District were lower than a year ago.  As a result, office prices and rents increased from a month ago and several respondents expected these increases to continue.  Commercial real estate contacts anticipated adjustments to absorption and vacancies reflecting a firm market, even while sales were expected to be flat in the coming months. Banking Bankers reported that loans increased somewhat since the last survey, while deposits held steady.  Demand for commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans rose, while demand for residential mortgage loans edged down.

Energy contacts reported availability of labor as their top concern, with availability of equipment and services being the next most important factor limiting activity.  Most contacts anticipated drilling activity to decline in the next three months. Agriculture Agricultural conditions improved in December, although drought continued to affect some areas.  In parts of eastern Colorado, western Oklahoma and Nebraska, winter snowstorms disrupted power and transportation for rural residents.  Inclement weather limited cattle weight gains and led to animal deaths in some areas.  The winter wheat crop appeared to be in better condition in areas receiving recent precipitation.  December snows provided cover for winter wheat and improved prospects for soil moisture and stream flows next spring.  Corn and soybean yields were down from last year's outstanding levels.  Higher crop prices boosted current and future incomes with more prevalent use of forward contracting.  Higher crop prices, however, also boosted feed costs and limited profits for livestock producers.
