Economic activity in the Fifth District expanded modestly since our last report, with slowing activity in some sectors offset by firming growth in others.  Retail sales were generally solid through the holiday season, and activity held up in early January.  Manufacturing measures moved a bit lower as demand for some lines softened.  Housing activity edged higher, as sales firmed and home inventories eased lower in some areas.  Commercial real estate agents noted that conditions in the sector remained strong, and construction and leasing activity was steady in recent weeks.  District labor markets continued to be taut, with strong demand for workers, especially in urban areas.  Price pressures were mixed, with some upward drift apparent in raw material costs.  In agriculture, unseasonably mild weather boosted crop conditions and extended the grazing season for livestock.
Commercial agents across the District reported that leasing and construction activity remained at generally strong levels though recent activity was sluggish.  In Washington, D.C., market conditions were characterized as tight, leading to more construction and rising rents.  In contrast, agents in some mid-sized cities noted steady activity with varying flat vacancy rates and little pressures on rents.  Across the District, contacts noted that former commercial space in downtown areas continued to be converted to residential uses.  Several agents said that conditions will likely strengthen in coming months.  They cited increased interest in their areas by national firms looking to expand.
