Economic activity in the Fifth District continued to expand modestly since our last report, with further softness in big-ticket sales and manufacturing shipments offset by stronger growth in services activity. Retail sales weakened in recent weeks, partly because of lackluster sales of domestic automobiles. Gauges of manufacturing activity again softened, with textiles and furniture firms reporting notably weaker demand. In contrast, activity at District services firms expanded at a quicker pace, and contacts were a bit more optimistic about their prospects going forward. District housing markets showed broader signs of firming, with sales edging higher in many areas. Home prices, however, generally continued to be flat to slightly lower. District labor markets remained tight, with skilled workers in short supply and some evidence of higher wages. Price pressures were mixed, with higher energy prices a concern. In agriculture, livestock were in generally good condition as were winter small-grain crops.
Commercial real estate agents gave generally mixed reports. A Washington, D.C., contact said that retail leasing activity slowed in recent weeks due to "some resistance to high rents and less optimism going forward." A northern Virginia agent noted softer demand for office space, though he said that rental rates remained strong despite recently higher vacancy rates. In contrast, the Raleigh commercial market continued to strengthen since our last report. The office and industrial segments were particularly active with lower vacancies and higher rents. Most other areas in the District reported little change in recent weeks.
