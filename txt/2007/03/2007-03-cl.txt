Economic activity in the Fourth District showed modest growth since early January with restraint from the auto and housing sectors tempering growth in others. Production by manufacturers was stable to increasing. Activity in commercial construction has increased while residential contractors report sales remain stable--at low levels. Post holiday sales by retailers were disappointing, weather being cited as a primary reason. Loan demand at banks was flat while core deposits and credit quality were characterized as stable. Overall, energy-related activity was flat to slightly down. And demand for trucking and shipping services continues to soften.
On net, employment across the District was reported to be holding steady. However, staffing firms remain upbeat about the number of job openings. Three-fourths of our contacts said that openings have increased over the past six weeks and on a year-over-year basis with the greatest demand seen in health care. With the exception of some energy-related businesses and retailers, wage pressures are largely contained. Several manufacturers and building contractors reported that material prices, especially metals, are rising. In response, some District manufacturers increased their prices; results were positive except in the auto and housing markets. Almost all retailers said that they continue to hold their prices steady.
The outlook expressed by most manufacturers is best described as steady to increasing. Steel producers are expecting a pickup in demand during the second quarter. Capital expenditures were on-plan for almost all manufacturers as few were concerned about their capacity utilization rates. About one-third of our contacts indicated they are planning to increase capital spending during 2007 with four producers planning major expansions. A majority of producers reported a rise in input prices--particularly for metals--since early January. In response, about half of our contacts said they increased their prices. Most were successful except in the auto and housing markets. Hiring was limited during the past six weeks; however almost half of our contacts said they plan to add jobs during the remainder of 2007.
