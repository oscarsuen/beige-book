Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to grow at a moderate pace on net during the survey period of January through late February. Upward price pressures remained modest and eased further in some sectors, despite slightly faster growth in labor costs on net. Retailers reported modest sales gains, with robust gains reported for service providers. Manufacturers and agricultural producers also reported demand growth, although significant supply constraints were noted for some crops. District housing markets cooled further, while conditions in commercial real estate markets continued to firm. Banks reported additional growth in loan demand, albeit at a reduced pace in some areas.
Growth in labor compensation inched up relative to the previous survey period but remained moderate overall. Recent increases have been driven primarily by compensation components other than base wages and salaries, such as bonus payments and rising costs for health-care benefits. Compensation growth continued to be more rapid for some worker groups with specialized skills and in areas with very tight labor markets, notably Idaho and Hawaii.
Most service providers saw robust demand, with especially strong conditions noted for food and beverage, health-care, technology, and legal services. Travel and tourism activity was at high levels and grew further in some regions, notably in the San Francisco Bay Area. However, tourist visits have leveled out in Hawaii, as significant declines in visits by foreign tourists have offset continued moderate growth in domestic tourism; contacts there reported that hotel occupancy rates have fallen relative to a year earlier.
