The Tenth District economy continued to grow in June and early July, but at a moderating pace.  Consumer spending was mixed, with reportedly level retail sales but robust activity in the travel and leisure industries.  Manufacturing activity slowed and residential real estate activity remained weak, but these trends were partially offset by strong commercial construction activity.  Energy activity continued to rise.  Recent precipitation improved growing conditions, although excess moisture in some areas limited wheat production.  Overall, District labor markets continued to expand, with announced hiring outpacing planned layoffs.  Reports of labor shortages and wage pressures remained unchanged from the last survey period.  Price pressures generally eased modestly despite high agricultural and energy prices.
