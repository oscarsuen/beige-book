Economic activity in the District generally advanced at a moderate pace during June and early July, with uneven growth across sectors.  Following six months of declines, manufacturing rebounded behind increases in new orders and shipments.  Additionally, the service sector continued to post strong revenue growth during recent weeks.  Commercial leasing activity also maintained its solid pace, though pockets of softness in retail leasing were noted.  In residential markets, contacts reported a slight improvement during the last six weeks as sales activity picked up a bit in some areas.  Assessments of other sectors were not as rosy.  The pace of commercial and mortgage lending activity subsided since our last report.  Moreover, weakness in big-ticket categories continued to constrain overall retail sales, while a stretch of particularly hot and dry weather hindered crop development.  Tourist activity was mixed.  On the employment front, hiring activity across the District intensified since our last report, amid already taut labor markets.  Turning to prices, contacts indicated that price growth in the District generally continued to rise as businesses passed along increases in raw material and finished good prices.
