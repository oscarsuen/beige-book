The Twelfth District economy expanded at a moderate pace during the survey period of early June through mid-July.  Overall price inflation was modest; labor compensation rose moderately overall, although upward pressure remained strong for selected worker groups with specialized skills.  Reports on retail sales were mixed, while service providers saw further sales gains but at a reduced pace in some cases.  Manufacturers' reports pointed to expansion on net, and agricultural producers saw solid demand growth.  Housing market activity was weak overall and slowed further in many areas, while demand for commercial real estate continued to firm.  Banks reported growth in loan demand with the exception of residential mortgages.
Growth in labor compensation continued at a moderate pace overall.  The reports in general were mixed, with some contacts in areas with especially tight labor markets pointing to a recent pickup in wage growth and some contacts in other areas pointing to moderation.  Wages continued to grow at a brisk clip for selected worker groups with specialized skills, such as engineers and some occupations in the financial services sector.
Sales by service providers continued to expand on net, but the pace moderated in some cases.  Growth remained especially rapid for providers of health-care services, and it picked up for some providers of computer services, but it slowed for some categories of professional services.  Travel and tourism activity was at a high level overall, although reports from various areas suggested weakness in foreign tourist activity despite relative strength in foreign currencies.  Tourist activity in Hawaii picked up somewhat of late, but growth in domestic tourist visits and spending have been largely offset by the reduced number of visitors from Japan this year.
