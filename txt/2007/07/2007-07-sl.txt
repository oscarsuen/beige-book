Economic activity in the Eighth District has expanded moderately since our previous survey.  Reports from manufacturing were generally positive, and reports from the services sector indicated continued expansion.  Market conditions in both residential and commercial real estate, however, were mixed.  Total lending activity at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks increased from late March to mid-June.
The District's services sector continued to expand.  Contacts in the business support services, health services, and professional, scientific, and technical services industries announced plans to expand facilities and hire additional workers.  Retail sales have increased at a moderate pace despite high gas prices. Auto sales were higher in June and the first half of July compared with the same period last year.  Auto dealers indicated that demand for hybrids, small sedans, and smaller sport utility vehicles has been high, but large vehicles and sport utility vehicles have not been selling well.
Commercial real estate market conditions were mixed throughout the District.  The first-quarter 2007 office vacancy rate decreased in St. Louis over the fourth quarter of 2006.  During the same period, the industrial vacancy rate in St. Louis increased slightly.  In Memphis, contacts reported that industrial leasing activity is up after a slow start in the first quarter.  Contacts in Jackson, Tennessee, reported that commercial construction activity remains strong.  Contacts in Little Rock reported plans to build a new industrial plant.
