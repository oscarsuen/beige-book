The Twelfth District economy continued to expand at a moderate pace during the survey period of mid-April through late May.  Overall price inflation was modest; growth in labor compensation generally remained moderate despite tight labor markets, although contacts noted further hefty salary increases for selected worker groups with specialized skills.  Retailers in general reported moderate sales gains, while demand growth was strong for most categories of services.  Manufacturers' reports were somewhat mixed but positive on balance, and agricultural producers reported solid sales.  Housing market activity remained sluggish, but activity in commercial real estate markets picked up further.  Banks saw further growth in loan demand with the exception of residential mortgages.
Growth in labor compensation was moderate overall, although it remained rapid for selected worker groups with specialized skills and in areas with very tight labor markets.  More generally, tight labor markets have led employers to devote increasing effort and resources to attracting and retaining skilled workers.  Contacts noted that productivity increases have helped to ease labor cost pressures in some sectors, and they expect little or no change in the rate of productivity growth this year compared with last year.
Service providers generally reported solid demand, with robust sales in the food and beverage, information technology, and health-care sectors.  However, scattered reports indicated reduced demand for transportation services.  Travel and tourism activity was at high levels in key District locales, but it has slowed in Hawaii after two record-breaking years, reflecting a modest decline in domestic tourism and a sharp decline in visits by Japanese tourists.
