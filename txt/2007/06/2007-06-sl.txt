Despite mixed reports in some sectors, the economy of the Eighth District expanded modestly since our previous report.  While reports from the services sector indicated continued expansion, reports from manufacturing did not present as clear a picture.  Retail and auto sales increased in April and the first three weeks of May compared with a year ago.  Home sales were mixed, while commercial real estate market conditions remained favorable.  Overall lending activity at a sample of District banks was mostly unchanged during the first quarter of 2007.
Car dealers in the District reported that, compared with last year, sales for April and the first three weeks of May were up, on average.  About 46 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported increases in sales, and a similar percentage of contacts reported declines, although of a smaller magnitude.  About 33 percent of the car dealers noted that used car sales had increased relative to new car sales, while 8 percent reported the opposite.  Also, 38 percent reported an increase in low-end vehicle sales relative to high-end vehicle sales, while 8 percent reported the opposite.  About 25 percent of contacts reported higher rejection rates of finance applications and 8 percent reported higher acceptance rates.  One-third of the car dealers surveyed reported that their inventories were too low (mostly on used vehicles), while 21 percent reported that their inventories were too high (mostly on high-end and new vehicles).  About two-thirds of the car dealers expect increased sales over 2006 during the summer months, 4 percent expect sales to be the same, and 29 percent expect decreased sales.
The District's services sector continued to expand steadily in most areas. Contacts in the health services and air transportation industries reported plans to expand operations.  Firms in the support services industries reported plans to hire additional workers.  In contrast, a contact in the trucking industry reported a substantial decline in both inbound and outbound tonnage.
Commercial real estate market conditions remained favorable throughout the District.  The 2007 first-quarter industrial vacancy rate increased in Memphis and Little Rock over the fourth quarter of 2006, while it decreased slightly in Louisville.  During the same period, the office vacancy rate was unchanged in Memphis and decreased in Louisville and Little Rock.  Contacts in Louisville report that commercial and industrial construction appears brisk.  Contacts in central Mississippi report that a commercial and industrial expansion project is forthcoming.  Contacts in west St. Louis County report plans for a light industrial park.  And contacts in west Memphis report plans for a new industrial park.
