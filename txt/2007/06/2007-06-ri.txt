On balance, reports on Fifth District economic activity indicated that growth picked up a bit during late April and May.  Services firms continued to be a catalyst for growth as revenues expanded briskly in recent weeks.  Similarly, commercial lending activity at financial institutions remained strong since our previous report.  Tourism-related business in the District also strengthened over the last six weeks--bolstered by robust Memorial Day bookings.  Not all reports were upbeat, however.  Softness in big-ticket categories kept retail sales weak in recent weeks, and manufacturing activity continued to contract somewhat.  The reports on housing sales and prices remained generally soft though pockets of strength were noted.  Reports on commercial markets, on the other hand, were mainly positive headlined by an overall increase in leasing activity.  In agriculture, crop conditions were described as "fair to good" despite some concerns over moisture levels.  Prices reportedly grew at a slightly faster pace in recent weeks, behind reports of particularly sharp increases in the price of raw materials from some District manufacturers.  Wages were more varied with services firms indicating slower wage growth while retailers reported somewhat faster growth.
Feedback on commercial activity was somewhat brighter during recent weeks.  Commercial real estate agents reported an uptick in leasing activity since our last report.  Contacts noted that the increase in the demand for commercial space was concentrated in the retail and industrial segments of the market, while the demand for office space remained steady.  A Washington, D.C., Realtor said that customer interest in retail space made him realize how slow activity had been earlier this year.  Contacts in northern Virginia and Raleigh, N.C., reported increases in the construction of industrial space.  The Raleigh agent also noted that though local industrial vacancy rates were still high, quality industrial space was generally in short supply.  Reports on commercial vacancy rates and rent levels across the District indicated little change since our last report.
