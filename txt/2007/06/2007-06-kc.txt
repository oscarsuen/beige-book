The Tenth District economy expanded at a modest pace in May.  High energy prices underpinned district energy production, but limited consumer spending, especially for non-essential goods.  Manufacturing production strengthened since the first quarter, though higher input costs restrained activity toward the end of the survey period.  Residential real estate activity remained weak, but was partially offset by strong commercial construction activity.  High crop prices and ample moisture bolstered agricultural conditions.  District labor markets continued to expand at a solid pace, while wage pressures remained elevated.  Price pressures intensified and contacts expected input, wholesale, and retail prices to increase further in coming months.
