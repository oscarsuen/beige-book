Reports  from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that the national economy  continued to expand during the survey period of October through mid-November  but at a reduced pace compared with the previous survey period.  Among Districts, seven reported a slower pace  of economic activity while the remainder generally pointed to modest expansion  or mixed conditions.
District reports indicated  relatively soft retail spending; most retailers said that they were expecting a  slow holiday season, with only small gains in sales volumes compared with last  year. By contrast, tourist activity expanded further in most Districts.  Providers of nonfinancial services to  consumers and businesses generally saw continued solid growth in demand,  although a few Districts pointed to reduced demand for transportation services.  Reports from the manufacturing sector were  mixed across Districts and sectors, suggesting little change in activity on  net.  Producers in the agricultural and  natural-resources sectors saw robust demand, with sales of agricultural  products spurred in part by rapid growth in export demand.  The glut of available homes continued,  keeping downward pressure on prices and construction activity.  The demand for commercial real estate  remained strong in most areas but showed signs of leveling off in some.  Reports from banks and other financial  institutions suggested slower growth in overall loan demand, with some  Districts noting a reduction in the volume of commercial and industrial  lending.
Upward pressures on the prices of  final goods and services remained modest overall but were significant for  products and services that rely heavily on food and energy inputs.  Increases in the costs of energy and selected  raw materials pushed up production and transportation costs for firms in  various manufacturing and services sectors, although this was offset in part by  price declines for lumber and transportation equipment.  Food prices remained on an upward trajectory.  Outside of products and services that rely  heavily on energy and food inputs, final prices were reported to be largely  stable or down a bit.  Wage increases  were moderate in general; upward wage pressures eased in a few areas where  labor markets loosened slightly, although they remained strong for assorted  groups of skilled workers.
Looking ahead, the reports were slightly  pessimistic about prospects for the holiday retail season.  Most Districts reported that retailers expect  growth in retail sales to be modest at best relative to last year, and  retailers generally were described as having a "cautious" attitude about the  upcoming holiday season.  Consistent with  this assessment, the Richmond, Dallas,  and San Francisco Districts reported early-season price discounting by  retailers.  In the Boston  and Minneapolis Districts, retailers expressed cautious optimism for holiday  sales, but they generally expect consumer spending to weaken in 2008.  Several reports indicated that retail inventories  have risen a bit of late and were higher than desired levels during the survey  period.
Activity in the travel and tourism  sector generally was at a high level and increased further in some cases.  The Richmond,  Minneapolis, and Kansas City  Districts reported that tourist bookings grew or were above normal seasonal  expectations during the survey period, and tourism activity in New    York City remained at a high level.  The Atlanta District reported that Florida's  tourist trade was up, spurred in large part by foreign visitors.  In contrast, visitor travel and business at  major tourist destinations in the San Francisco District, including Hawaii and  Southern California, have declined a bit from the high levels established in  2006.
Available reports on the  transportation sector suggest that the level of activity declined somewhat  compared with the previous survey period.   The Cleveland District reported that trucking volumes were "steady to  declining" and that employment has fallen a bit; Dallas  noted that overall shipping activity has weakened; and Atlanta  reported lower shipping volumes for autos and materials for home construction.
Reports on capacity utilization suggested  that manufacturers on net were operating near long-term average levels, albeit  with substantial variation evident across sectors depending on the strength of  product demand.  The reports also  suggested little change in utilization rates during the survey period.  A few Districts reported on capital spending  by manufacturers and other businesses, noting tentative plans for continued  moderate capacity expansion, but with the proviso that actual spending will  reflect realized needs as they develop.
Demand for commercial, industrial,  and retail space generally remained at high levels and expanded further in some  areas, although signs of leveling off were evident in several Districts.  Vacancy rates on commercial and industrial  space remained relatively low in most Districts and declined in some, even  where substantial new space has been added of late.  Rents have risen accordingly in many areas.  In the extreme, New York  reported a 30 percent increase in asking rents on Manhattan  office space over the past 12 months; however, this represents a smaller  increase than in previous surveys, and a recent increase in vacancy rates there  is likely to further temper that trend going forward.  A few Districts reported emerging signs of  declining demand for commercial space:  this  included assorted indicators of weaker demand in the major metro areas in the  Boston District, reduced leasing activity in Philadelphia, commercial  construction activity that was described as "flat to down slightly compared  with a year ago" in Atlanta, and reduced transactions and rising vacancy rates  in some parts of the San Francisco District.   Construction of commercial and public buildings and infrastructure  projects remained high in most Districts, however, partly offsetting low  residential building activity and helping to limit losses in overall construction  employment.
Consumer lending was little changed  on net, while residential mortgage lending continued its downward slide.  More stringent credit conditions remained a constraint  for residential mortgage lending in general, with additional tightening during  the survey period reported by Chicago, Kansas  City, and Dallas; scattered reports  suggested slightly stricter standards on consumer loans as well.  Mortgage delinquencies increased  significantly in many areas, and some Districts pointed to slight deterioration  in credit quality for consumer loans.
Reports on the natural-resources  sector indicated further growth from very high levels of activity.  High oil prices have stimulated expanded  drilling in the Atlanta and Dallas  Districts; Minneapolis reported  increased activity in the energy and mining sectors since the last report; and Kansas    City reported that "energy activity remained robust."  However, Cleveland  reported a slight decline in production of natural gas.
Labor markets remained relatively  tight overall but loosened in some areas, and wage pressures were largely unchanged  from the previous survey period.  Most  reports suggested that wage increases continued at a moderate pace, with  numerical reports in the range of 3 to 4 percent on an annual basis.  Dallas  and San Francisco reported that  labor market tightness eased somewhat, relieving upward wage pressures in some  areas, but Kansas City noted that  wage pressures picked up.  Wage gains remained  especially rapid for assorted groups of workers with specialized skills used in  expanding sectors, such as engineers in the San Francisco District.
