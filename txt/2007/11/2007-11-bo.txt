First District businesses  contacted in mid-November mostly report continuing revenue gains, but rising  caution. Staffing firms cite steady growth and particular strength in the Boston area, while software and  information technology services firms report a slowdown in revenue growth.  Residential real estate markets remain weak and commercial markets continue to  soften. Manufacturers are raising selling prices to pass along cost increases;  they are more upbeat than retailers about 2008.
Inventory levels are mixed. Headcounts  are also mixed, with some respondents reporting increased headcount in line  with company growth or seasonal hiring, while another reports a modest layoff. One  retailer reports intentionally hiring significantly fewer seasonal employees  than usual, while another notes that finding seasonal employees has been  difficult because more people have fulltime jobs. Several contacts cite price  pressures, especially for dairy products. Some respondents say they are starting  to feel the effect of rising oil and gasoline prices, including increased  surcharges and sharply higher prices for plastics. Selling prices remain mostly  stable.
A tourism contact reports  that 2007 has been a banner year in the Boston metropolitan area for leisure,  business, and convention travel.   International travel has been particularly strong because of the weak  dollar, and is expected to continue to be robust.  However, there is a growing sense of  uncertainty about how the increasing price of home heating oil and gasoline  will affect domestic leisure travel and tourism in 2008.
Overall, First District  retail respondents are cautious in their outlook for early 2008, although some  are still cautiously optimistic. Most respondents are worried about the impact  of rising energy costs and the recent volatility in financial markets on both  consumer confidence and disposable income.   Several retailers express more concern about early 2008 than about the  upcoming holiday period.
Most manufacturers report  that materials costs are rising, especially for metals and oil derivatives, as  well as for items priced in currencies that have appreciated against the  dollar. Only a few respondents have experienced rising energy prices in recent  months; a couple of firms indicate they are shifting to natural gas or wind  power to reduce their dependence on oil. Over three-quarters of the  manufacturing contacts have responded to higher input costs by raising their  selling prices.
Manufacturers continue to  adjust their U.S. headcounts only minimally,  but they report somewhat more new restructuring efforts or caution in hiring  than earlier in 2007. Average wage and salary increases remain in the range of  3 percent to 4 percent.  Domestic capital  spending plans are mixed, but generally moderate; U.S. spending will largely  reflect whether and where firms need to add production and product development  capacity.
Manufacturers and related services providers  are mostly cautiously optimistic about their business prospects over the coming  year. Even those that have a positive sales forecast for 2008 cite downside  risks from factors such as weak consumer confidence, depressed housing markets,  higher oil and commodity prices, and constrained credit availability.
Conditions in the office leasing  market are mixed, but overall the mood has turned more pessimistic. Rental rate  increases appear to be slowing in Boston, where absorption and lease  renewals have slowed. Despite increases in "face rents," lessors have begun  offering building improvements and other concessions in order to retain or  attract tenants. Such deals, together with rising energy and construction  costs, are squeezing owners' profit margins. Office rents and vacancy rates  have been flat in Hartford and Providence, but rents have reportedly  fallen 10 percent in Portland year over year, where  absorption is zero or negative. In Rhode Island, the industrial market  remains strong, with declining vacancy and rising rents, but the retail sector  has been mostly "quiet."
Lender reluctance to finance  speculative development is expected to continue over the next 6 to 12 months. Construction  projects in progress or in the planning stages are likely to be delayed or  downsized (especially if they include condominiums), and "build-to-suit" structures  are expected to be the only new construction. European demand for office  investment is expected to remain active. Contacts now seem less likely than  earlier to believe that liquidity will return to the CMBS/conduit market in  force by Q1 2008, although activity is expected to pick up eventually. Some  contacts (in Boston, Providence, and W. Hartford) expect  commercial vacancy rates to continue falling, while others expect absorption to  slow and rent growth to stall or become negative. Still, most contacts do not  predict a glut of commercial space, because supply growth has been restrained over  the past few years.
Residential markets in the  rest of New England similarly show large sales declines and modest price  declines in September. Comprehensive September data from Connecticut (including foreclosure sales,  etc.) show a 3 percent decline year-over-year in median home prices, along with  a 22 percent drop in home sales, after relatively small changes in July and  August. Similar data from Rhode Island show home sales dropping 27  percent year-over-year in September and prices decreasing 7 percent, but Rhode Island realtors' data show more  modest declines, with home sales down 9 percent and prices down 2 percent.  Realtors' data for New Hampshire and Maine show year-over-year home  sales declines of 16 to 18 percent and median price declines under 3 percent.
