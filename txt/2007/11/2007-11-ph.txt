Business activity expanded modestly  in the Third District in October and early November. Manufacturers, on balance,  reported slight increases in new orders and shipments. Retailers generally  reported somewhat better sales growth in early November than in October. Auto  sales remained slow, and below the year-ago level. Overall bank lending has  been rising, with better growth in business lending than in consumer and real  estate lending. Residential real estate sales remained well off the pace set  last year and earlier this year, and home building continued to decline.  Commercial building occupancy and rents have been rising, but building prices  have eased down and leasing activity has slowed since mid-year. Firms reporting  on labor costs generally noted a continuing trend of moderate increase in  wages, but they continued to report large increases in health care benefits  costs. Firms reported increases in input costs and output prices in November,  and some noted that prices were rising for an increasing number of imported  goods.
The outlook in the  Third District manufacturing sector is positive, although not as strongly  optimistic as it had been through most of this year. Around forty percent of  the firms contacted for this report expect increases in new orders and  shipments over the next six months, and twenty percent expect decreases.  Manufacturing firms in the region plan to increase capital spending during the  next six months, on balance, but the number of firms that expect to spend more  only slightly exceeds the number that expect to spend less.
Auto dealers in the region  generally reported slow sales rates, especially for sport utility vehicles.  Overall sales remained below the year-ago level, and most of the dealers  surveyed for this report do not expect improvement.
Commercial real estate  firms report that office vacancy rates have declined and rents have increased in  most office markets in the Third District in the past few months.  However, they noted that leasing activity has  decreased and building prices have edged down.   Construction of educational and health care facilities has been steady  or rising throughout the region, but construction of commercial buildings has  slowed. Nevertheless, contacts in commercial real estate said there are plans  for new buildings that could be acted on next year if the region's supply of  large blocks of office space continues to trend down and employment growth  improves.
