The pace of economic  activity in the Eleventh District decelerated further from mid-October to  mid-November. Manufacturing activity continued to weaken, and demand for  business services was softer. Retail sales were weaker than expected. Financial  service firms reported slower consumer and commercial lending. Home real estate  markets and construction continued to soften, but commercial and multi-family  building and markets remained strong. Energy  activity picked up. Agricultural conditions remained generally positive.
The  level of uncertainty remains quite high, and some firms say it has increased  over the past month. Most industries expect activity to pick up in 2008, but  the expected timing of the rebound varies from firm to firm.
Higher  energy costs are putting upward pressure on selling prices for most industries,  but competitive pressures continue to restrain price increases for many firms.  Shipping firms say rising fuel costs have pushed up prices, and some expect  further price increases in January. Airline fares are also higher.
Manufacturers  continued to report cost pressures from higher fuel, raw materials and import  price pressure from declines in the value of the dollar. Price pressures  continue to be a serious concern for the food industry. Costs are high or  rising for many products, which contacts attribute mostly to increased demand  for corn to make ethanol. Prices have recently risen sharply for wheat and  flour, in part because production was displaced for corn.
Some high-tech manufacturers  reported continued good sales, but other said sales were slower, leading them  to reduce their outlook for activity. Demand for food products is stable,  although producers say there has been some shifting of consumption to  lower-priced foods. Paper producers say demand for recycled paper is very high,  but a noticeable drop in sales of corrugated boxes to manufacturing and  construction has caused inventories to rise. Transportation manufacturers  report stable demand. Auto producers say inventories are a little high.
Domestic petrochemical  demand was still weak, with slow sales to homebuilders and auto producers. A  weak dollar and favorable feedstock prices are still spurring strong export  demand, but higher feedstock costs have driven up prices for some chemicals, hurting sales. Refiners were  reluctant to build crude inventories with current prices well above futures.
There has been little change  in demand for accounting and legal firms. Accounting firms reported steady  demand and a very good outlook. Law firms report a pickup in bankruptcy and  litigation work that is sufficient to offset slower real estate and corporate  transactions. Contacts say the recent shift in legal activity usually signals a  slowing economy.
Overall shipping activity  has been weaker. Intermodal firms say imports have fallen and are not being  completely offset by export growth. Small parcel volume has been decelerating  over the past two months, but large freight volume appears to have increased.  Railroad volume is still strong but weaker than a year ago, with particularly  weak shipments of motor vehicles, lumber and wood.
Airlines reported strong  demand and no sign of weakness in bookings. Capacity is flat to shrinking.  Contacts are very concerned about rising fuel costs and the possibility that a  slowing economy might affect business travel, but said they are hoping for a  soft landing.
Office leasing  continued to expand, although growth is still slowing from last year's pace.  Office rents have risen strongly in most metropolitan areas, but some contacts  are uncertain they will hold up because of new construction and the  deceleration in demand for space. Office fundamentals remain quite good, according  to contacts, but investment activity is still being hampered by difficulties  obtaining credit. A few contacts say commercial credit availability deteriorated  in November after improving in September and October.
Consumer lending has  softened, particularly for automobiles. There has been a slight shift toward  credit card lending and away from home equity lending. Real estate lending for  the most creditworthy borrowers has increased as mortgage rates have chased the  10-year Treasury rate down. Commercial lenders say some of the recent slowing  in lending may be seasonal, but most of their clients have revised down their  outlook and anticipate further softening in the economy.
