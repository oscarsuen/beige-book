The  Twelfth District economy expanded during the survey period of October through  mid-November, but the pace of growth showed signs of further deceleration  relative to recent survey periods.   Upward price pressures were modest in general with the exception of  sharp increases in the prices of food and energy, and increases in labor  compensation were moderate on net.   Reports on retail sales were downbeat in general, and demand for  services grew at a slower pace than in recent survey periods.  Manufacturing activity held up well overall,  and agricultural producers reported further growth in demand and sales.  Home demand and construction remained  exceptionally weak, while demand for commercial real estate remained strong but  showed signs of softening in some areas.   Banking contacts reported little or no growth in overall lending  activity and tighter credit standards for various types of loans.
Upward wage pressures were moderate  on net, with contacts noting only small changes in overall labor costs.  Reports from several sectors, including  banking and construction, indicated that slight loosening in labor markets has  relieved upward wage pressures of late, although wage increases remained rapid  for engineers and other skilled technical workers in many areas.
Demand for services grew further but  signs of slowing were widespread.   Providers of health-care services reported continued strong growth.  However, sales by advertising agencies and  providers of media services were held down by weak advertising demand from  sellers of automobiles and home furnishings.   Similarly, activity fell further for providers of services related to  home sales, such as real estate agencies and title companies.  Travel and tourism activity remained at high  levels in major District markets, but conditions have cooled, with contacts  from Southern California and Hawaii  reporting that indicators such as visitor counts and spending are flat to down  slightly relative to a year earlier.
