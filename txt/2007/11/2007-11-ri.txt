Economic conditions in the Fifth District weakened somewhat  in October and early November as continued softness in retail sales and housing  markets trumped stronger revenue growth at services firms. District retailers  said the pullback in sales and shopper traffic intensified during the early  weeks of the holiday shopping season. Housing activity also softened further as  the pace of home sales continued to cool, inventory levels moved higher, and  reports of price reductions became more widespread. Home mortgage demand  softened as well. Adding to the softer tone, extremely dry conditions continued  to hamper farm operations in many areas. Reports from other sectors were more  upbeat, however. District service providers posted stronger revenues during the  last six weeks, while tourist activity advanced at a healthy clip.  Manufacturing contacts reported a slight uptick in production during early  November and the leasing of commercial real estate space was steady. On the  employment front, the pace of hiring eased, though District labor markets  remained generally tight and wage growth edged higher. Prices at District firms  rose modestly since our last report.
On the  commercial real estate front, reports on District office markets were mixed,  while assessments of retail and industrial leasing were generally upbeat.  Contacts in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Md.  and the Carolinas noted slower office leasing activity in October and early  November, though an agent in Raleigh, N.C., suggested that the "the recent slow  down is only temporary."  On the other  hand, agents in Richmond, Va., Charleston, W.Va., and northern Virginia reported steady office leasing activity  in recent weeks.  Demand for retail space  remained generally strong according to contacts in Virginia Beach, Va., and Columbia, S.C.   Assessments of District industrial markets were mostly positive as  well.  A contact in Charleston, W.Va., said industrial leasing in his area  was in "good shape," and a contact in Columbia, S.C., said his market was "the tightest  it had been in ten years."  Vacancy rates  and rents for office and retail space were generally unchanged since our last  report, while industrial vacancies firmed in several markets.  Reports on new construction varied.  New retail projects were reported in Richmond  Va., Virginia Beach, Va., and Columbia, S.C., whereas a contact in Washington,  D.C., said retail construction had slowed somewhat.
