The Ninth District economy grew moderately since the  last report. Growth was noted in consumer spending, tourism, services,  commercial construction and real estate, manufacturing, energy, mining and  agriculture. Residential construction and real estate continued to weaken.  Employment was mixed, with tight conditions in the western part of the District  and loosening in the east. Overall wage increases were moderate, while significant price increases were noted for  fuel, fertilizer, food, steel and copper products.
An auto dealer in Montana noted that recent demand  for smaller cars is increasing and that overall car sales are ahead of last  year. Car sales softened during October and early  November, according to a representative of a Minnesota auto dealers  association.
Fall tourism was up, and officials were optimistic for the winter season.  Tourism and convention business was strong during October in Duluth, Minn., according to an official;  inventory, occupancy and rates were up. According to a chamber of commerce  representative in northwestern Wisconsin, overall tourism-related  traffic was good and businesses were optimistic for the winter season.
In contrast, Minnesota employment levels were down  6,600 jobs in October from September and were only slightly above last year's  levels. A residential real estate lender recently announced plans to cut 460  jobs in Minnesota, while a producer of air  conditioning and heating equipment plans to lay off up to 145 workers in  southwestern Wisconsin.
Overall wage increases were moderate. The preliminary  results of the Minneapolis Fed's outlook poll showed that 87 percent of  respondents expect wages and salaries to increase no more than 3 percent at  businesses in their communities during 2008.
While overall price increases were  moderate, significant increases were noted for fuel, fertilizer, food, steel  and copper products. Minnesota gasoline prices in early November  were about 85 cents a gallon higher than a year ago, while Midwest diesel prices were about 80 cents  higher. A Montana bank director noted that fertilizer and a number of food  prices have increased over the past three months. Some steel and copper product  prices recently rose.
