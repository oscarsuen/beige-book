Reports from contacts for October through mid-November  continued to paint a mixed picture of economic activity in the Sixth  District.  Retail reports suggested that  year-over-year sales growth had moderated somewhat, and vehicle sales fell short  of expectations.  In contrast, tourism  reports were generally positive.  According  to homebuilders and Realtors, new and existing home  sales remained well below year-ago levels in October and the pace of new home  construction continued to decline.  The  inventory of homes for sale remained high across much of the District.  Manufacturing reports varied by sector; the  pace of production slowed for most manufacturers linked to residential housing,  but remained strong for firms connected to energy, medical, and defense-related  industries.  Banking contacts noted moderating  loan demand and higher foreclosure and mortgage delinquency rates in many  areas.  Labor markets remained tight in  parts of the District, but there were reports of increased layoffs in  construction and some housing services industries.  Price pressures were centered on energy and  food products.  Exceptional drought  conditions in areas of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee continued to hamper crop production.
Tourism reports  were largely positive.  Foreign travel has  boosted leisure and hospitality activity in Florida,  and industry contacts expect Canadian travel to the Sunshine   State to increase to record numbers  this winter because of appreciation in the Canadian dollar.  Hotel and resort occupancies in South   Florida increased, in part because of increased business from Europe  and Latin America.   A North Florida hotel contact said that the pace  of bookings for next year is solid.   Gaming revenue remained strong along the Mississippi   Gulf Coast.  All tourism industry contacts indicated that  increasing gasoline prices were a significant risk factor for the outlook.
October reports on  commercial construction indicated that activity was flat to down slightly  compared with a year ago.  Most Florida  contacts continued to report fewer projects in the pipeline compared with last  year at this time, while outside of Florida  there were scattered reports of declining backlogs.  Several contacts noted that high insurance  costs remained a stumbling block for commercial development along the Gulf   Coast.
Price reports were mixed.  Weak  housing markets continued to adversely affect District suppliers of building  materials and fixtures.  Demand for  milled lumber, for example, is weak and prices have declined further.  In contrast, some food prices have risen  substantially.  According to one contact,  there have been double-digit increases in prices received for flour, sugar, and  soy.  Prices are reportedly also  increasing for milk and corn products.
