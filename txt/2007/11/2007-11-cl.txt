Economic growth in the Fourth District, although positive,  has slowed since our last report.  In  general, manufacturing output has been steady while production at auto assembly  plants increased during October.  Activity  in commercial construction was stable with a few contractors expecting a  slowing in their backlogs going into 2008.   Home builders reported new home sales were unchanged to declining.  District retailers experienced relatively  weak sales.  Demand for business and  consumer loans was steady to declining while the number of delinquencies  rose.  Reports on credit quality showed  some deterioration, especially on the consumer side.  Oil production was up whereas natural gas  production fell slightly.  Truck freight  volume was unchanged to declining.
Employment levels  across the District were largely unchanged.  On balance,  staffing firms reported a slight decrease in job openings while the number of  job seekers was flat.  Little wage  pressure was reported.  With the  exception of petroleum-based products, supplier prices and material costs were  relatively stable.  Several manufacturers reported raising  their prices during the past six weeks, and some anticipate raising prices in  the upcoming months.
Most manufacturers  reported that capacity utilization is at, or slightly below, normal levels with  little to no change over the past six weeks.   Further, capital expenditures were on plan with the expectation that  current spending levels will be maintained in the upcoming months.  With the exception of petroleum-based  products and metals, input prices were stable.   About a third of our contacts said they have raised their prices during  the past six weeks, and some anticipate raising prices in the upcoming months.  A majority of respondents reported no change  in the size of their workforce.  Those  citing employment declines attributed them to organizational restructuring, seasonal  factors, and attrition.  Hiring in the  near future is expected to be very slow.   Wage pressures were minimal.
Most commercial  contractors reported that business has been stable since early October and has  picked-up slightly on a year-over-year basis.   Segments showing strong activity include health care, education, and  infrastructure.  Looking forward, nearly  all contacts said that they expect activity in 2008 to be at, or near, 2007  levels.  When asked to comment on their  backlogs, contractors had mixed responses.   Some rated their backlogs as good to very good while others, although  busy at this time, are expecting some slowing going into 2008.  For the most part, material costs were stable  during the past six weeks--though fuel costs have risen significantly.  Workforce levels remain largely unchanged.  Contractors have not experienced any wage  pressures; however, almost all reported increased health care costs.
