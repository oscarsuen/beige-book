The Second District's economy has continued to expand since  the last report, though at a somewhat more subdued pace than in recent months.  The labor market has remained strong in  October and early November.  Manufacturers  report ongoing expansion in activity in early November, with increased price  pressures.  In contrast,  non-manufacturers report some weakening.   But respondents in both sectors express less optimism about the future  business outlook than in recent months.  Retailers  show mixed sales results for October and some have scaled back expectations for  the holiday shopping season.  Tourism  activity in New York City is said to have remained strong,  despite a mid-November strike shutting most Broadway theaters.  Housing markets remain mixed, with Manhattan's co-op and condo market showing  continued resilience but single-family housing markets across New York State increasingly soft.  Manhattan's office market, though still fairly  tight, eased off a bit in October.   Finally, bankers report weakening loan demand in all categories but  particularly for home mortgages; they also report tightened credit standards on  commercial loans and mortgages, and moderate increases in delinquency rates  across all categories, most notably on residential mortgages.
Tourism activity in New York City has been steady at a high level,  despite a Broadway theater strike.  Manhattan hotels report that occupancy  rates exceeded 90 percent in October, little changed from last year, while room  rates are reported to be up by 16 percent.   Broadway theaters report  that attendance and revenues were at high levels in October and early November  but down a bit from a year ago.  A strike  starting November 10 shut most Broadway theaters but there is, thus far, no  sign of deleterious effects on tourism overall.   Consumer confidence has waned since the last report.  The Conference Board's survey of Middle  Atlantic residents indicates a pullback in confidence in October, reversing an  increase in September.  Similarly, Siena College's survey of New York State residents shows confidence falling  in October, led by a particularly steep decline in upstate New York.
Manhattan's co-op and condo market showed  continued resilience in October and early November, with prices continuing to  run modestly above year-ago levels and sales volume picking up moderately  compared with the third quarter.  The  inventory of units on the market is reported to be down by roughly a third from  comparable 2006 levels.  Long Island's market is reported to remain  somewhat sluggish, though demand remains strong in the pricier Hamptons area.  Reports from Realtors across New York State indicate continued weakness in the  market for single-family homes, with prices down 7 percent from a year ago and  unit sales down nearly 20 percent.
New York State manufacturers report steady  improvement in business conditions in early November; however, contacts express  considerably less optimism about the six month outlook than in recent  months.  Firms report increasingly  widespread escalation in both current and expected input prices in early  November.  Overall, a growing proportion  of non-manufacturing firms in the District report some weakening in general  business activity as of early November, and express a good deal less optimism  about the general outlook; however, considerably more firms continue to report  rising than falling employment at their firms, and the same is true with  respect to expected changes in the next six months.
