Reports from District contacts indicated    that economic activity remained mixed from mid-July through August. In the consumer sector, retail sales    improved modestly, the tourist industry indicated strong activity, while    vehicle sales continued to weaken.    Home sales stayed well below year-ago levels in most parts of the    District, and construction levels declined further because of the large    unsold inventory. Contacts indicated    that they expect weakness in housing markets to persist for several months.    Manufacturing activity was mixed, with weakness noted in the building    materials and automotive segments.    Regional freight activity declined.    Banking contacts reported increased loan delinquencies and tighter    lending standards. Labor market conditions were described as being tight,    especially for skilled positions, whereas layoffs continued to increase in    housing-related industries. Overall,    reports on prices and wages indicated no unusual developments. The persistent drought and severe heat in    most areas has adversely affected crop production.
According    to industry contacts, vehicle sales in July and August remained subdued. Although gasoline prices retreated, auto    dealerships continued to report that fuel economy remains an important    consideration for buyers. Contacts    reported that promotions did little to improve sales, particularly for    full-size trucks and SUVs. Distributors of some regionally produced foreign    brands observed moderately higher sales in July and August, but sales still    lagged behind the national pace for these foreign makes. Industry reports    noted an increase in auto loan delinquencies, higher financing costs for    sub-prime buyers, and a decline in the number of customers financing vehicles    from home-equity lines of credit.
Most reports indicated positive tourism    activity. Strong hotel bookings were    reported by contacts in Orlando, boosted by robust theme-park    attendance. Also, activity during    August was described as being higher in South Florida than a year earlier.    The recovery of Mississippi's Gulf Coast casinos continued, with revenues in    July exceeding pre-Katrina levels.    Casinos were adding to payrolls, although housing shortages remained a    problem in attracting workers. New    Orleans' Louis Armstrong International Airport reported that passenger    numbers continued to improve only gradually.
Reports    from transportation industry contacts indicated weak freight demand. Declines in shipments to and from firms    associated with construction and autos continued to be noted. However, Georgia trucking contacts also    reported that shipments to retailers were slowing.
Hurricane Dean did not have a    significant impact on energy production along the Louisiana coast. Crude oil    deliveries to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico region reached its highest    post-Hurricane Katrina level in late July.
