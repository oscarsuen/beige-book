Economic activity in the Eighth District    has continued to expand at a moderate pace since our previous report. Retail    sales are generally up from the previous year, although some weakness has    been noted in furniture and auto sales. Manufacturing activity continued to    increase, albeit somewhat unevenly.    Home sales and residential construction remain weak throughout most of    the District, but commercial construction activity remains strong in most    areas. Overall lending activity at District banks has remained steady. Contacts report that recent financial    market volatility has had little impact on District banks, with problems    limited to specific subsectors. Ongoing drought conditions are taking a toll    on agriculture in most parts of the District. Crop yields for corn, soybeans,    and cotton are all expected to be adversely affected by continuing dry, hot    conditions.
Car dealers in the District reported that, compared    with last year, sales in July and the first half of August were down 6    percent, on average. About 65 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported a    decrease in sales, while 27 percent reported an increase. Approximately 35    percent of the respondents reported recent increases in rebates and    incentives, while 8 percent reported fewer rebates. About 15 percent reported    more rejections of finance applications, but 12 percent of the contacts    reported more acceptances. About 27 percent of the car dealers surveyed    reported that their inventories were too high (mostly on    trucks and SUVs), while the same percentage reported that their inventories    were too low (mostly on fuel-efficient and used vehicles). Slightly more than    half of the car dealers expect increased sales in September and October; the    remaining contacts are divided equally between expectations for unchanged    sales and lower sales.
The District's service sector has    continued to expand steadily since our previous report. Contacts in the    business support services and educational services industries reported plans    to hire additional workers in the District. A firm in the air transportation    industry reported plans to expand operations.
Commercial real estate markets were mixed    throughout the District. The second quarter 2007 industrial vacancy rates in    Memphis, St. Louis, Louisville, and Little Rock all saw a slight increase    over the first quarter of 2007. During the same period, the office vacancy    rate increased slightly in Memphis and Louisville and decreased slightly in    St. Louis.
More recently, while contacts in the    banking industry have indicated some concern about financial market    volatility, none report any significant impact on their business. Mortgage    delinquency rates are up slightly over the past several months but problems    appear to be isolated. Credit availability has tightened considerably for    non-conforming loans, but agency-eligible loans are experiencing only minor    pricing issues.
