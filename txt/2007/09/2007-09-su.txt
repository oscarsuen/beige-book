Reports from the Federal Reserve    Districts indicate that economic activity has continued to expand.  St. Louis and Kansas City described the    pace of activity as moderate; Cleveland, Chicago and Minneapolis said their    economies were expanding at a modest rate; and Boston and Atlanta reported    that activity was mixed.  New York    cited continued expansion.  The    economies in Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco continued to    grow; however, the pace of activity has slowed.
Most Banks reported that the recent    developments in financial markets had led to tighter lending standards for    residential mortgages, which was having a noticeable effect on housing    activity, and several noted that the reduction in credit availability added    to uncertainty about when the housing market might turn around. While several    Banks noted that commercial real estate markets had also experienced somewhat    tighter credit conditions, a number commented that credit availability and    credit quality remained good for most consumer and business borrowers.  Outside of real estate, reports that the    turmoil in financial markets had affected economic activity during the survey    period were limited.
Retail sales were generally positive,    with increases characterized as modest to moderate.  However, several Districts described motor    vehicle and furniture sales as slow.     Manufacturing activity expanded across most Districts, with reports of    softening demand for building materials and autos.  The weakness in the housing market deepened    across most Districts, with sales weak or declining and prices reported to be    falling or flat.  Most Districts    reported a continuing contraction in the residential mortgage market.    Commercial real estate activity was generally stable to expanding.  Demand for business loans held steady or    weakened, while consumer lending was mixed.     Agricultural conditions varied widely across Districts, with several    reporting damage to crops and pastures as a result of excessive heat and    drought conditions. Activity in the energy and mining sectors remained    positive in all of the Districts reporting on these sectors.  Nearly every District reported at least    modest increases in employment during the recent survey period.  Most Districts characterized their wage    increases as moderate or steady. Wage pressures were intense only in isolated    professions in short supply.  And most    Districts reported little change in overall price pressures.
Furniture sales declined in    Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco while Boston experienced    stronger sales. Merchants in New York and Chicago reported a slight pickup in    sales of home furnishings.  Retailers    in Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City noted solid-to-strong    back-to-school sales. However, Chicago and Dallas reported difficulty    comparing back-to-school shopping with last year because of school-year    timing.  Boston and Kansas City    reported strong sales of apparel items while New York and St. Louis    experienced mixed results.  Some    weakening in apparel sales was seen in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and    Chicago.
Vehicle sales were described as slow or subdued in    many Districts.  Cleveland, Richmond,    Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco, all reported sluggish    new vehicle sales.  In contrast, auto    dealers reported that sales increased modestly in Kansas City and picked up    slightly in Philadelphia.  Cleveland    and San Francisco noted strength in used vehicle sales.  Many auto dealers reported anxiety about    future sales due to tighter household credit conditions.
Districts that commented on retail inventory levels    generally described them as at or above desired levels. Several retailers    reported that they planned to or had already heavily discounted merchandise    to move inventory.
Most reports on tourism were positive,    with the New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts reporting    particularly solid growth in tourist spending.  Minneapolis cited dry, warm weather for    helping the tourism industry.  Two    Districts were less positive on tourism:     San Francisco experienced slowing tourist activity and Chicago    described a pessimistic outlook for the rest of the year despite a slight    pickup in some parts of the District in August.
The automobile and building materials    industries showed weakness across most reporting Districts. Cleveland,    Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas all indicated that the auto sector had softened,    though one report suggested that some of the reduction in production was    related to model changeovers.  Six    Districts said that industries related to housing experienced weakness,    including building materials and construction equipment.
Industries showing improved conditions    varied markedly across Districts.     High-technology manufacturing was strong in the Kansas City and San    Francisco regions and showed steady growth in the Dallas District.  A number of Districts reported steady to    solid growth in aircraft and electrical equipment production and strength in    exports.  Chicago noted that some steel    producers have started exporting steel regularly for the first time.  Most Districts indicated that input price    pressures held steady or rose modestly compared to the previous report.  Expenditures for plant and equipment    remained close to plan in Boston and Cleveland.  Contacts in San Francisco reported that    productivity improvements continued on trend in 2007.  Looking forward, contacts in New York,    Philadelphia, Richmond, and Kansas City expressed near-term optimism about    business conditions in their sectors; reports from Cleveland and Dallas were    somewhat more cautious.
Commercial    real estate and construction markets were generally stable to expanding    across the Districts. Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated    continued expansion in nonresidential construction and commercial real    estate.  Dallas described the level of    nonresidential activity as high, and St. Louis said commercial construction    remained strong.  New York, Cleveland,    Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City indicated commercial construction    and real estate markets were steady or stable. Vacancy rates are reported to    be low or declining in most Districts, and rents are rising modestly in    many.  Boston, New York, Richmond,    Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas noted some tightening of credit in the    commercial real estate market.
More than half of the Districts reported    a tightening in credit standards.     Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas mentioned    tightening for both residential mortgages and business loans, while financial    institutions in Atlanta and San Francisco said tighter standards were aimed    primarily at home mortgage products.     Delinquencies in consumer loans and mortgages rose slightly in    Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis, while New York reported no change    in delinquencies across all loan categories.
Demand for business loans was steady or    weakening in New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis, while Philadelphia    reported an increase in demand.  Commercial real estate lending increased in    Kansas City and was quite strong in San Francisco, where "some banks    reportedly are approaching regulatory limits on loan concentrations for this    segment."
Though some Districts described    employment condition as tight, most reported that wage increases were    moderate or steady.  Wage pressures    were intense only in isolated professions in short supply. Several Districts    also noted that costs of health care benefits continued to post large    increases, although they were not accelerating.
Most Districts reported little change in    overall price pressures.  There was    downward pressure on residential real estate prices across nearly all    Districts. Three Districts--Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas--reported lower    lumber prices, while Atlanta reported that these prices stabilized.  Three Districts noted discounting among    retailers during the back-to-school selling season (New York, Philadelphia,    and Dallas), while two others reported overall declines in retailers' prices    (Richmond and Kansas City). However, higher food costs continued to be widely    reported and were said to be putting upward pressure on grocery and    restaurant prices.
