Business activity expanded in the Third    District in August, although the pace of expansion appeared to ease somewhat.    Manufacturers, on balance, reported increases in new orders and shipments,    although the number of firms reporting increases declined from a month ago.    Retailers generally reported year-over-year gains in August in line with    previous months, although some stores had weaker than expected sales. Auto    sales improved slightly from July to August but remained below the level of a    year ago. Overall bank lending rose slightly, with gains in business and    personal lending, but residential mortgage activity declined. Residential    real estate demand has weakened considerably since our last report, but    demand for commercial real estate has remained strong. Firms reporting on    labor costs generally noted moderate, steady rates of increase in wages, but    several said increases in non-wage benefits costs were large. Firms reported    increases in input costs and output prices in August, although the extent of    the increases did not appear to have changed much since July.
Third District firms generally foresee    continued growth in the next few months, although several contacts said they    expect the rate of growth to ease. Manufacturers expect some increases in    demand for their products in the months ahead, and, except for some    manufacturers of building products, they have plans to increase capital    spending. Retailers generally expect sales to increase at their current rate.    Auto dealers are not certain of the near-term outlook, although they expect    sales for the year as a whole to be below those of last year. Bankers    anticipate further growth in business and personal lending, albeit at a    slower pace, but they expect residential mortgage lending to decline. Home    builders and residential real estate agents expect sales to remain slow. Most    contacts in commercial real estate anticipate continued strong demand for    office and industrial space, but several contacts believe office construction    activity could decline late this year and into next year.
Half the manufacturing firms contacted    for this report expect increases in new orders and shipments over the next    six months, and only a few expect decreases. Firms in most of the major    manufacturing industries in the region have scheduled increased capital    spending in the next six months, although makers of wood and metal products    have trimmed planned capital expenditures.
Auto dealers in the region generally    reported a slight pickup in sales from July to August, but they are uncertain    that the higher rate of sales will continue. Most expect sales for this year    as a whole to be below those of last year. Foreign makes continued to have    better year-over-year sales comparisons than domestic makes, and dealers    believe reorganization and other managerial changes at domestic manufacturers    could hamper marketing efforts and limit possibilities for increasing sales    of their vehicles. Consolidation and closings of dealerships continue, mainly    for domestic makes.
Contacts in secondary debt markets    reported a sharp drop-off in demand for collateralized debt obligations in    mid-August affecting securities backed by residential as well as commercial    real estate debt. Contacts said that concern about underlying credit quality    has risen among investors in collateralized debt obligations. However, some    contacts reported that further decreases in prices would probably prompt    purchases of secondary market securities that can meet more critical scrutiny    for risk. Despite any possible improvement in secondary markets, however,    most contacts do not expect the residential mortgage origination business to    rebound soon.
Commercial real estate firms report that    office vacancy rates in the region have continued to decline over the past    several months, and rental rates have increased. Demand for office space has    grown as firms in the region have expanded. Although new buildings have added    to available space, conversion of older buildings to other uses has removed    some space from office markets.
Construction    is up in many office markets in the region, on both a build-to-suit and a    speculative basis. Industrial real estate firms report that overall demand    for industrial space remains strong. Vacancy rates have moved down and rents    have risen moderately. Construction of industrial buildings has increased.    Looking ahead, some contacts in the commercial real estate sector are not certain    that construction of commercial buildings will continue to rise, but several    contacts indicated that they expected public infrastructure construction to    pick up, mainly for roads and bridges and for utilities.
Most of the firms reporting on    employment costs in August indicated a continuing trend of moderate wage    increases. Several firms noted that increases in benefit costs continued to    be large, although not accelerating. Nevertheless, employers in the region    said they were continuing to look for ways to reduce benefit costs.
