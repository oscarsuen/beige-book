The Tenth District economy expanded at a    moderate pace in late July and August.    Consumer spending increased, driven by strong tourism spending, and    labor markets continued to expand.    Manufacturing activity rebounded slightly, and commercial real estate    activity continued at a solid pace.    Energy activity remained at strong levels, and agricultural conditions    were favorable. On the other hand,    residential real estate weakened further. Some banks tightened real estate    lending standards, but bankers tended to report that overall loan demand was    up slightly. Wage pressures remained    largely contained and most price pressures eased slightly.
