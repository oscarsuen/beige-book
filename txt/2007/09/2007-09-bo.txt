For most first District businesses    contacted in the second half of August, recent results are similar to the last    few reports--some up, some down--but they express increased uncertainty looking    forward. Many contacts report that    turmoil in financial markets is obscuring their near-term outlook. Price pressures are said to have eased    somewhat, while selected professional and technical workers remain in short    supply.
Inventory levels are mixed, while    headcounts are generally stable (except in connection with store openings).    Capital spending is also varied, with several retailers reporting slight    increases in spending levels because of acquisitions, store openings, and    systems upgrades. Contrary to recent periods, most contacts cite decreased    vendor price pressure, with the exception of paper and some metals. One    contact says excess supplies of lumber have pushed prices down. Selling    prices are generally stable.
Respondents are cautious though    optimistic in their outlook; most expressed concern with consumer confidence    going forward. While one retailer expects fallout from the current turmoil in    financial markets to be manageable, another asked "will the consumer step up    to the plate and keep shopping and buying?"
Most manufacturers describe materials costs as    remaining stable. Some note dips in prices of natural gas, metals, and other    commodities in the past several weeks. Selling prices are mostly holding    steady, with any increases characterized as selective or only partially    successful.
Contacts generally are adjusting their    U.S. headcounts only minimally (up or down), and average wage and salary    increases are remaining in the range of 3 percent to 4 percent. There are    scattered reports of difficulties finding qualified applicants for factory    jobs, or of increased turnover among selected professionals. Manufacturers'    domestic capital spending patterns vary widely but are holding to plan.
Some manufacturers continue to expect "more of    the same" for the remainder of 2007, while others indicate they have become    more cautious or more watchful for signs of weakness than before the recent    turmoil in financial markets. For    example, several contacts mention that their customers' spending is likely to    be held down as a direct result of tighter lending standards or a general    reluctance to make discretionary purchases.
The majority of New England software and    information technology firms are projecting revenues to continue growing at    current rates. However, several contacts note that they are concerned about    current financial market conditions and worry that this will "give customers    pause."
Contacts express concern with the impact    of financial volatility on the staffing industry. One fears that demand for    labor in the financial sector will decline, while another attributes the    already perceptible slowdown in demand for permanent hires to the    instability, as companies are less willing to commit to permanent positions    when the economy is unpredictable. Nonetheless, all contacts have a positive    outlook, expecting stable growth through the end of the year.
Across the region, office rents have    been either flat or increasing in recent months, with vacancy rates either    flat or declining. Boston has seen some significant increases in rents for    new, Class A office space and in some suburban properties that rent to the    biotech sector. Vacancies hover around 10 percent or less downtown. In the    rest of the region, rents and vacancies have been stable, with vacancies in    the single digits in some regions of Connecticut and Rhode Island.
Respondents say upward pressure on rents    should ease as sales prices soften from recent highs, but rents are mostly    expected to hold steady. Some contacts see downside risks to rental demand,    based on the possibility of economic slowdown. Some new inventory is expected    in the region, but may take a year or more to come on line; in the meantime,    vacancies are expected to decline slowly. The region's smaller markets expect    less fallout from a commercial real estate downturn because fewer risky deals    were made, while a Boston contact predicts a rise in defaults around 2009 as    balloon payments come due.
However, this moderate improvement was    not shared throughout the region. A Connecticut contact reports decreases in    sales volume and steady prices, while respondents in New Hampshire, Rhode    Island, and Maine indicate markets remain soft. In New Hampshire, the median    sales price dropped 1.5 percent year-over-year in July, as sales dropped    about 12 percent. Single-family sales volume in Rhode Island declined 6.3    percent year-over-year in the second quarter, while the median price    decreased 1.7 percent.
Contacts note that currently available    data do not reflect the effects of the most recent developments in financial    markets and express concern about potential fallout. Several contacts note    that widespread news reports of tighter lending standards and increased    foreclosures may drive away some potential home buyers.
