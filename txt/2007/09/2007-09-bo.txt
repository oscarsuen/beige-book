For most first District businesses    contacted in the second half of August, recent results are similar to the last    few reports--some up, some down--but they express increased uncertainty looking    forward. Many contacts report that    turmoil in financial markets is obscuring their near-term outlook. Price pressures are said to have eased    somewhat, while selected professional and technical workers remain in short    supply. Retail Retailers in the First District report    mixed sales results during the summer months. Same-store sales ranged from    low double-digit decreases to single-digit increases. Furniture, apparel and accessories, and    computers were among the items that reportedly sold well. Inventory levels are mixed, while    headcounts are generally stable (except in connection with store openings).    Capital spending is also varied, with several retailers reporting slight    increases in spending levels because of acquisitions, store openings, and    systems upgrades. Contrary to recent periods, most contacts cite decreased    vendor price pressure, with the exception of paper and some metals. One    contact says excess supplies of lumber have pushed prices down. Selling    prices are generally stable. Respondents are cautious though    optimistic in their outlook; most expressed concern with consumer confidence    going forward. While one retailer expects fallout from the current turmoil in    financial markets to be manageable, another asked "will the consumer step up    to the plate and keep shopping and buying?" Manufacturing and Related    Services Manufacturers and related services    providers headquartered in the First District report that sales and orders    have been mixed in the second and third quarters, largely depending on    product line. Sales of housing-related equipment continue to run below    year-ago levels, with no sign that a pickup will occur later this year    (except for normal seasonal variation). A firm that sells equipment    associated with the manufacture of consumer electronics detects signs that    holiday-related production may be weaker than expected. However, sales of    equipment related to transportation (other than autos), energy, and commercial    building continue to grow at a robust pace. Several firms mention growth in    foreign markets. Most manufacturers describe materials costs as    remaining stable. Some note dips in prices of natural gas, metals, and other    commodities in the past several weeks. Selling prices are mostly holding    steady, with any increases characterized as selective or only partially    successful. Contacts generally are adjusting their    U.S. headcounts only minimally (up or down), and average wage and salary    increases are remaining in the range of 3 percent to 4 percent. There are    scattered reports of difficulties finding qualified applicants for factory    jobs, or of increased turnover among selected professionals. Manufacturers'    domestic capital spending patterns vary widely but are holding to plan. Some manufacturers continue to expect "more of    the same" for the remainder of 2007, while others indicate they have become    more cautious or more watchful for signs of weakness than before the recent    turmoil in financial markets. For    example, several contacts mention that their customers' spending is likely to    be held down as a direct result of tighter lending standards or a general    reluctance to make discretionary purchases. Software and Information Technology    Services The majority of software and IT services    contacts in the First District report mid-single-digit revenue growth for the    most recent quarter. Respondents say demand from the banking and financial    services industries was robust; demand for security and compliance technology    also remains strong. Half of respondents are adding to headcounts in    revenue-generating positions such as sales and consulting; the remaining half    expect headcounts to be unchanged. Firms that are hiring report tight labor    markets for software engineers. All contacted firms in this sector have    raised (or plan to raise) pay in 2007, generally between 3 percent and 5    percent compared with 2006. The majority of New England software and    information technology firms are projecting revenues to continue growing at    current rates. However, several contacts note that they are concerned about    current financial market conditions and worry that this will "give customers    pause." Staffing Services Staffing respondents in the New England    region report steady growth throughout the second quarter. Companies with    Boston locations note a marked increase in local revenues, often citing it as    their strongest location. Demand for temporary labor is outpacing permanent,    which has flattened for all but two firms. Demand for high-end labor has    increased the most, causing bill rates to rise. Indeed, both bill rates and    pay rates are slightly higher for most companies, with one respondent    reporting a 9 percent increase in bill rates from a year ago. On the supply    side, firms cite a shortage of skilled labor, especially in legal,    accounting, consultant, engineering, secretarial, and executive    administrative positions. Respondents report stabilizing costs; while    healthcare costs are still rising, the rate of increase has slowed. Contacts express concern with the impact    of financial volatility on the staffing industry. One fears that demand for    labor in the financial sector will decline, while another attributes the    already perceptible slowdown in demand for permanent hires to the    instability, as companies are less willing to commit to permanent positions    when the economy is unpredictable. Nonetheless, all contacts have a positive    outlook, expecting stable growth through the end of the year. Commercial Real Estate Mirroring the general unrest in credit    markets, commercial real estate markets in New England are said to be    experiencing a significant tightening of credit. One contact reports that    some primary lenders in Boston stopped lending altogether a few weeks back; while    they are back in business now, spreads are up sharply. Respondents expect    that, with the stricter requirements lenders have been demanding, sales activity will    experience--in one contact's words--"a major disturbance" in the near future,    despite the fact that underlying fundamentals in the region's commercial    markets appear relatively robust. One contact expects the biggest impact to    fall on sales of retail buildings and multi-unit apartment buildings.    Respondents say there is already evidence of significant downward pressure on    prices. Across the region, office rents have    been either flat or increasing in recent months, with vacancy rates either    flat or declining. Boston has seen some significant increases in rents for    new, Class A office space and in some suburban properties that rent to the    biotech sector. Vacancies hover around 10 percent or less downtown. In the    rest of the region, rents and vacancies have been stable, with vacancies in    the single digits in some regions of Connecticut and Rhode Island. Respondents say upward pressure on rents    should ease as sales prices soften from recent highs, but rents are mostly    expected to hold steady. Some contacts see downside risks to rental demand,    based on the possibility of economic slowdown. Some new inventory is expected    in the region, but may take a year or more to come on line; in the meantime,    vacancies are expected to decline slowly. The region's smaller markets expect    less fallout from a commercial real estate downturn because fewer risky deals    were made, while a Boston contact predicts a rise in defaults around 2009 as    balloon payments come due. Residential    Real Estate Home-sellers say the Massachusetts    residential real estate market performed fairly well in July. The    Massachusetts Association of Realtors reports sales rose 6 percent and the    median sales price of single-family homes increased 1.3 percent compared to    July 2006. Condominium sales remained almost steady year-over-year, while    median condo prices increased 6.3 percent over the same period. Furthermore,    supply has decreased to what contacts consider to be "balanced" levels, 8.6    months for both single-family homes and condominiums, down from more than 10    months in 2006. However, this moderate improvement was    not shared throughout the region. A Connecticut contact reports decreases in    sales volume and steady prices, while respondents in New Hampshire, Rhode    Island, and Maine indicate markets remain soft. In New Hampshire, the median    sales price dropped 1.5 percent year-over-year in July, as sales dropped    about 12 percent. Single-family sales volume in Rhode Island declined 6.3    percent year-over-year in the second quarter, while the median price    decreased 1.7 percent. Contacts note that currently available    data do not reflect the effects of the most recent developments in financial    markets and express concern about potential fallout. Several contacts note    that widespread news reports of tighter lending standards and increased    foreclosures may drive away some potential home buyers.
