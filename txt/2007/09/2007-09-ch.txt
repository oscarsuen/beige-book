Economic activity in the Seventh    District continued to expand at a modest pace in July and August. Only a few    contacts reported impacts on real economic activity from recent financial    market developments, though a number said the developments had led them to    lower their expectations for the rest of the year. Consumer spending and    business outlays continued to rise. Labor market conditions were mixed by    industry and location. Residential construction declined further in most    areas, while the pace of nonresidential development was generally steady.    Manufacturing expanded at a slower pace. Household lending declined, while    business lending was flat. Overall wage and cost pressures were similar to    those in the previous reporting period. The District was poised for a record    corn crop, although first dry weather and then storms hurt corn and soybean    conditions.
