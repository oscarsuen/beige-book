The pace of economic activity in the    Eleventh District continued to decelerate in July and August, but respondents    with national operations said the District economy remained stronger than    much of the rest of the country. Tighter credit standards curtailed some    residential construction, which caused home building to decelerate at a    slightly faster pace. The level of nonresidential construction is still high,    but tighter credit standards have restrained some commercial investment.    Manufacturing activity picked up slightly in recent weeks. Demand for    business services was mixed, but overall activity was similar to the last    report. Retail sales continued at roughly the same pace, but auto sales were    softer. Energy activity remains robust, and agricultural conditions were    mostly positive.
Contacts within the lending and real    estate communities are highly focused on recent changes in the perception of    credit risk and most have taken steps to cut costs and/or reduce employment.    A few companies reported serious financial stress. Others remain optimistic    that, while the cost of funds has increased for some borrowers, markets will    settle within 60 to 90 days leaving little long-lasting effect.
Outside the lending and real estate    communities, contacts are much less focused on or concerned about recent    changes in credit markets. A few expressed relief that the adjustment has    finally occurred and conditions are not worse. While cautious, many firms    reported seeing no impact so far for their customers or their company.    Retailers who lend to customers said they have experienced an increase in    delinquencies that has led them to become more careful scrutinizing the    credit worthiness of customers. A few are looking forward to lower costs for    commercial real estate. While many business leaders expressed increased    nervousness about the outlook, most were optimistic that there would be no    material impact on their firm and had not changed their business plan.
There is downward pressure on real estate prices.    Upward price pressures have abated for many construction-related products;    steel prices are steady at high levels, and prices have fallen for lumber,    aluminum and copper. Retailers say discounts are pushing down selling prices.    Auto dealers have increased incentives for both domestic and imported models.    High-tech firms say overcapacity is pushing down DRAM    prices. Natural gas prices have fallen, and the energy industry reported less    upward price pressure for some items used in drilling. Wholesale gasoline    prices fell as growing capacity utilization by refineries pushed domestic    inventories back up to the bottom of the normal range for this time of    year.
Demand for paper products was mixed. Firms supplying    cleaning supplies and other paper products to offices reported strong    increases in demand and an optimistic outlook. Sales of corrugated boxes to    manufacturers continued to soften, and the outlook was more uncertain.
Producers of high tech products said    sales and orders continued to grow at about the same or a slightly faster    pace. Equipment manufacturers reported a slow down in orders that they expect    will continue through the end of the year.
Food producers said demand was solid,    although contacts are wary about a possible slowdown as price increases are    passed to consumers. Factories producing transportation parts and vehicles    reported continued solid or strong activity, with the exception of    automobiles, where weaker demand led at least one factory to reduce    production.
Refineries moved back over 90 percent    utilization rates. Petrochemical sales were strong, boosted by a weak dollar    and buoyant global demand. Sales of most plastics have been climbing steadily    for most of this year. Weakness in the housing market has hurt sales of PVC    pipe and siding.
Rail, small parcel, and intermodal    transportation firms reported small decreases in cargo volume over the past    month. Airlines say loads and bookings are stronger than expected, and there    is no sign that consumer or business travelers are slowing down.
Office leasing activity remained slower    than last year, but market fundamentals are relatively good, with positive    absorption and rising rents. Developers say financing terms are changing    mid-deal, with lenders appearing unsure of how to price loans. According to    some respondents, there are fewer investors seeking property, and some    investment and/or development deals have been canceled. Contacts are nervous    but think the situation will correct itself soon. However, they fear investor    confidence will erode if problems continue into September.
Contacts expressed concern that the    growing inventory of natural gas may push prices down to levels that will    restrain some activity. Unconventional natural gas has been an important    element of the current level of drilling, and high natural gas prices are    required to justify this drilling. There are no signs of a slowdown so far,    and pressure pumping--a service closely associated with unconventional    drilling--was described as improving in demand and pricing in recent months.
