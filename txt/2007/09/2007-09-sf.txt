The Twelfth District economy expanded    during the survey period of late July through late August, but the reports    suggest that the momentum has slowed a bit.    Price pressures were limited overall, and upward pressures on labor    compensation were moderate on net, although they remained strong for selected    groups of skilled workers. Sales by    retailers and service providers were uneven, with the reports suggesting    modest growth on balance.    Manufacturing activity expanded further, and agricultural producers    saw solid sales gains and generally stable supply conditions. Housing market activity slowed further in    most areas, and most contacts from this sector expect further sales declines    in coming months due in part to more restrictive credit standards and higher    interest rates for residential mortgages.    Demand for commercial real estate continued to grow. Banks and other financial institutions    reported growth in loan demand but some pullback on credit availability,    primarily for residential real estate transactions. Wages and Prices Reports from District contacts indicated    that price inflation was modest overall.    Upward pressures eased for some manufacturers and service providers as    prices for energy and some raw materials fell, but significant price    increases continued for food products.    Increases in final prices to consumers reportedly were restrained by    vigorous competition, with scattered reports pointing to reduced profit    margins rather than price increases in response to cost pressures. Wage pressures were moderate on net,    with contacts noting only small changes in overall labor costs. Scattered    reports suggested some easing in upward wage pressures, such as in the Los    Angeles area, where labor markets have loosened slightly this year. Shortages of some types of skilled labor,    especially engineers and selected groups in the financial and professional    services sectors, have kept wage increases rapid for these groups; such skill    shortages reportedly have reduced some employers' ability to increase overall    productivity. Retail Trade and Services Reports on retail sales were mixed and    suggested modest growth overall.    Contacts noted that sales growth remained solid for luxury items and    for higher-end retailers in general, but sales were weak for discount chains. The slowdown in housing markets in most    areas has caused sales of household items to fall, with especially large    drops for furniture and smaller but significant declines for appliances. Sales of new vehicles reportedly weakened    further, especially for domestic makes.    By contrast, demand for used vehicles remained strong and sales grew    accordingly, despite a reduced supply of used vehicles from rental car    companies. Service providers saw further demand    growth on net but with slowing evident in some sectors. Demand continued to grow at a strong pace    for providers of health care, media, technology, and various professional    services. However, activity fell further for providers of services related to    home sales, such as real estate agencies and title companies. Growth in tourist activity has slowed in    major District markets: it was flat to down in Hawaii and largely flat in San    Francisco and Los Angeles, reportedly due to growing consumer caution in the    latter city. Reports on productivity    growth were mixed in the services and retail sectors, with some contacts    indicating a reduction in their ability to capture gains from new    technologies and organizational efficiencies and others reporting substantial    payoffs to ongoing investments in those areas. Manufacturing Demand for District manufactured    products expanded on net during the survey period of late July through late    August. Production activity and sales    remained very strong for makers of commercial aircraft and their suppliers.    Manufacturers of information technology products saw further modest gains in    sales and capacity utilization relative to earlier this year, while makers of    industrial equipment continued to report "steady" conditions. Food manufacturers reported strong growth    in sales. By contrast, demand fell    further for manufacturers of building materials, furniture, and household    appliances, and apparel makers noted a recent decline in sales relative to a    year earlier. Various manufacturing    contacts reported that productivity gains have continued at their previous    trend rate thus far in 2007, due to the introduction of new production    techniques and ongoing growth in product demand. Agriculture and Resource-related    Industries Demand for agricultural products    continued to grow and supply conditions were largely favorable. Sales growth    was strong for most row and tree crops and yields have been good. Unexpected summer rains helped to improve    grazing conditions for cattle ranchers in the Southwest. Some agricultural contacts reported that    pressures on input costs eased overall, but others noted that prices of feed    grain increased further and labor availability tightened in some areas. Real    Estate and Construction The District's housing market slowdown    continued, while activity in commercial real estate markets rose    further. The slide in home sales and    building activity continued in most parts of the District, and sales prices    for new and existing homes were flat to down slightly. Most contacts from this sector expect    further sales declines in coming months, due in part to more restrictive    credit standards and higher interest rates for residential mortgages. By contrast, construction and leasing    activity for commercial and industrial space grew further and vacancy rates    have reached low levels in some cities, most notably Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Moreover, in the Pacific Northwest and    Utah, rising construction activity for commercial and public works projects    has fully offset declining residential construction activity, keeping overall    construction employment stable or growing this year. Financial    Institutions District banking contacts reported that    loan demand grew on net, but the slide in mortgage lending deepened due in    part to more restrictive credit conditions.    Commercial lending activity grew in most areas, although a few    contacts noted slower growth late in the survey period. Contacts reported a sharp shift towards    tighter credit standards and higher interest rates for residential real    estate lending; the shift was largely limited to this one sector, although    contacts also provided scattered reports of a more general tightening in    credit availability. Lending activity    for commercial real estate projects continued at very high levels, and some    banks reportedly are approaching regulatory limits on loan concentrations for    this segment.
