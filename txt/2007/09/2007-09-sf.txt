The Twelfth District economy expanded    during the survey period of late July through late August, but the reports    suggest that the momentum has slowed a bit.    Price pressures were limited overall, and upward pressures on labor    compensation were moderate on net, although they remained strong for selected    groups of skilled workers. Sales by    retailers and service providers were uneven, with the reports suggesting    modest growth on balance.    Manufacturing activity expanded further, and agricultural producers    saw solid sales gains and generally stable supply conditions. Housing market activity slowed further in    most areas, and most contacts from this sector expect further sales declines    in coming months due in part to more restrictive credit standards and higher    interest rates for residential mortgages.    Demand for commercial real estate continued to grow. Banks and other financial institutions    reported growth in loan demand but some pullback on credit availability,    primarily for residential real estate transactions.
Wage pressures were moderate on net,    with contacts noting only small changes in overall labor costs. Scattered    reports suggested some easing in upward wage pressures, such as in the Los    Angeles area, where labor markets have loosened slightly this year. Shortages of some types of skilled labor,    especially engineers and selected groups in the financial and professional    services sectors, have kept wage increases rapid for these groups; such skill    shortages reportedly have reduced some employers' ability to increase overall    productivity.
Service providers saw further demand    growth on net but with slowing evident in some sectors. Demand continued to grow at a strong pace    for providers of health care, media, technology, and various professional    services. However, activity fell further for providers of services related to    home sales, such as real estate agencies and title companies. Growth in tourist activity has slowed in    major District markets: it was flat to down in Hawaii and largely flat in San    Francisco and Los Angeles, reportedly due to growing consumer caution in the    latter city. Reports on productivity    growth were mixed in the services and retail sectors, with some contacts    indicating a reduction in their ability to capture gains from new    technologies and organizational efficiencies and others reporting substantial    payoffs to ongoing investments in those areas.
