The Ninth District economy grew modestly    since the last report. Growth was noted in consumer spending, tourism,    services, commercial construction and real estate, manufacturing, energy,    mining and agriculture. Residential construction and real estate activity was    slow. A number of contacts reported tight labor conditions in their    industries or regions, and overall wage increases were moderate. Prices for    gasoline have eased since the last report.
Tourism activity was higher than a year ago. A    tourism official in South Dakota reported that activity was up about 8    percent in July compared with a year ago; relatively high gas prices didn't    seem to deter travelers to the area. Retailers and tourism-related businesses    in northwestern Wisconsin reported solid traffic and sales; dry, warm weather    generally helped tourism activity, although river water levels were low for    kayaking and canoeing. A tourism official in Montana reported year-to-date    visits to Glacier National Park up 11 percent and Yellowstone National Park    up 9 percent.
Commercial real estate was up slightly.    Vacancy rates for office, industrial and medical space in Minneapolis-St.    Paul all declined through the second quarter of this year, though retail    vacancy increased slightly. A contact in Fargo, N.D., said market activity    there was moving at a healthy pace. Residential real estate was slow, with    some exceptions. Home sales in Minneapolis-St. Paul increased 2 percent from    June to July, but were down from year-earlier levels, and the inventory of    homes for sale is large and growing. However, in Sioux Falls, sales were on    track to match or beat last year's record levels. A director from western    Montana indicated sales are still strong, but inventory is up significantly    compared with the past two years.
Overall wage increases were moderate.    Wages for manufacturing workers increased 1.7 percent for the three-month    period ended in July. Hired workers at farms in Michigan, Wisconsin and    Minnesota were paid only 4 cents per hour more in July compared with the same    period a year ago.
Prices for gasoline have eased recently.    Minnesota gasoline prices in mid-August were almost 30 cents per gallon lower    than in mid-July and slightly lower than a year ago. Recent increases in natural gas prices    showed signs of easing in late August. A bank director noted that while    increases in health insurance costs remained relatively large, insurance    rates for workers' compensation were slightly lower than a year ago.
