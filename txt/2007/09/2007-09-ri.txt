On balance,    economic activity in the Fifth District grew at a somewhat slower pace in    late July and August as weakness in housing and retail sales offset firming    in manufacturing. Residential real    estate agents reported declines in sales and more widespread softness in home    prices. Additionally, mortgage    activity slipped since our last report, though financing continued to be    available for those with solid credit. Adding to the less than upbeat tone,    District merchants reported weaker retail sales as big-ticket categories    continued to slump. Moreover,    agricultural conditions across the District worsened over the last six weeks    as unrelenting heat and a lack of rain took their toll on crops. Assessments of    other sectors were rosier, however. District manufacturers reported increases    in shipments and new orders and tourism activity remained strong. Additionally, services firms noted    continued healthy revenue growth, while commercial real estate and commercial    lending activity were generally steady.    On the employment front, despite complaints of tight worker    availability, District hiring remained fairly brisk, including the first    expansion of manufacturing payrolls in eight months. Price growth in the District edged up    slightly during recent weeks.
On the commercial side, agents reported    a slight slowdown in office leasing in late July and August, while retail and    industrial activity remained generally healthy. Contacts in Washington, D.C., and Columbia,    S.C., reported that a normal, seasonal pause during the height of summer    vacations contributed to softer leasing activity. Reports on vacancy rates were mixed. In Washington, D.C., and Raleigh, N.C.,    contacts reported that office vacancy rates were steady in recent weeks,    while agents in Columbia, S.C., and Charlotte, N.C., noted slight decreases    in office vacancies. Retail vacancy    rates across the District were generally unchanged during the last six weeks. Reports on rental rates varied. Office rents    were said to have risen a bit in late July and August, though one contact in    Washington, D.C., noted a slight dip in rates in some office submarkets. Amid fears of tightening credit, agents in    northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., indicated that financing was still    available for new projects, though lenders were exercising more caution. Contacts reported little to no new    construction activity.
