The economy in the Fourth District    continued to grow at a modest pace during the past six weeks. In general, manufacturing output was stable    to increasing. Activity in commercial    construction was steady, with backlogs at acceptable levels. Home builders remain uncertain as to when    the housing market will turn around. Some do not expect an upturn until    turbulence in the housing finance markets subsides. Retail sales in the    District were mixed. Reports on    commercial and consumer lending show demand was steady or decreased    slightly. The mortgage market remains    sluggish, while auto lending increased. Oil and natural gas production showed    little change. And price competition    in the trucking industry intensified.
On net, reports point to a slight    increase in employment levels across the District. Staffing firms reported an increase in the    number of permanent openings, while the number of temporary job openings    decreased slightly. The greatest    demand for workers was in the health care industry. Overall, the number of    job seekers has declined since mid-July and on a year-over-year basis. Wage pressures were limited to the energy    sector and some highly technical and professional occupations. Manufacturers and builders told us that    input prices are stable, though some are stable at an elevated level.
In general, plant utilization rates were at normal    levels to 100 percent capacity.    Manufacturers reporting idle capacity were primarily in the chemical    and auto industries. Almost all    manufacturers told us that capital expenditures were on plan since    mid-July. However, since the last reporting    period, the number of respondents who had expected to increase their capital    investments in the next 12 months has declined. The decline was ascribed    primarily to a softening economy. When    asked about input prices, the majority    of producers we contacted said they were stable, or stable at an elevated    level. Global demand for metals and energy was the most often cited reason    for elevated prices. Only a few of the    manufacturers surveyed had attempted to increase their own prices during the    past six weeks. Looking forward, over    half said they either have plans to increase prices during the fourth quarter    or they will try to raise prices if raw material costs remain high. With respect to their workforce, about 20    percent of our contacts reported adding employees during the past six    weeks. Hiring in the near future is    expected to be slow, with little wage pressure anticipated.
Most commercial contractors told us that    business has been steady since mid-July as well as on a year-over-year    basis. Segments showing strong    activity include healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. The majority    of our respondents is satisfied with their current backlogs and is optimistic    about business opportunities in 2008.    For the most part, material costs were stable during the past six    weeks--metals being the exception. In    turn, almost all builders held their own prices steady.
