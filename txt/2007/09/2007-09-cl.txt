Manufacturing Most District manufacturers reported that production has been stable to increasing since mid-July. Further, a majority said they had increased their output on a year-over-year basis.

However, several respondents told us that they are expecting some softening in their respective markets due to the housing slump, tightening credit, and higher commodity prices. Auto assembly plants reported a significant production decline on a month-over-month basis, most of which is attributable to retooling for model changeovers. Although both domestic and foreign nameplates saw declines due to model changeovers, the rate of decline by domestic producers was almost double that of their foreign-nameplate counterparts.

Strong end markets for steel include non residential construction, energy, and defense. In general, plant utilization rates were at normal levels to 100 percent capacity. Manufacturers reporting idle capacity were primarily in the chemical and auto industries. Almost all manufacturers told us that capital expenditures were on plan since mid-July.

The decline was ascribed primarily to a softening economy. When asked about input prices, the majority of producers we contacted said they were stable, or stable at an elevated level. Global demand for metals and energy was the most often cited reason for elevated prices. Only a few of the manufacturers surveyed had attempted to increase their own prices during the past six weeks. Looking forward, over half said they either have plans to increase prices during the fourth quarter or they will try to raise prices if raw material costs remain high.

Looking forward, merchants anticipate little change in sales trends. On balance, supplier prices were stable during the past six weeks. Hiring has been limited to new store openings.

Almost all respondents told us that wage pressures are continuing, especially for skilled field personnel. Transportation Demand for trucking and shipping services was characterized as flat during the past six weeks by most carriers.

Further, the ability to recover 100 percent of fuel costs through surcharges is beginning to erode. Capital expenditures, primarily for truck engines, have been flat to declining. Wage increases were limited to annual cost-of-living adjustments. And a few carriers reported hiring drivers in order to increase capacity.
