The pace of economic activity in the Fifth District continued to cool in September and early October as weakness in housing markets persisted and services firms reported slower revenue growth.  Home sales remained sluggish across most of the District, while the demand for mortgages softened further.  Reports from District merchants were also less rosy as retail sales--particularly big-ticket categories--continued to pull back.  Additionally, widespread, drought-like conditions curbed crop yields and delayed winter plantings.  Assessments of other sectors were more upbeat, however. District manufacturers noted gains in shipments and new orders, and tourism contacts said activity had been solid since the Labor Day holiday.  Moreover, commercial real estate agents reported that leasing activity continued to be steady.  Turning to labor markets, the pace of hiring moderated somewhat in recent weeks, though District factories added workers for the second straight month.  On balance, price growth in the District was little changed since our last report.
Turning to commercial real estate, the pace of leasing activity in the Fifth District was unchanged over the last six weeks.  Contacts in Charlotte, N.C., Greenville, S.C., Richmond, Va., and Charleston, W.Va., reported steady leasing activity across all sectors, while an agent in Washington, D.C., said "activity was stable, though slower than this time last year."  Rents were firm for the most part and vacancy rates were generally unchanged.  On the investment front, contacts said deals were taking longer to complete as developers and financiers were exercising more caution.  Additionally, agents in Washington, D.C., and in Columbia, S.C., noted that some projects had been shelved or canceled altogether.  On the other hand, a Richmond, Va., Realtor said "there is still a lot of money out there" and a Baltimore, Md., Realtor reported that he was still seeing "lots of money chasing deals."
