Economic activity in the Eighth District expanded moderately since our previous survey.  Reports from manufacturing contacts were generally positive and contacts indicated that the services sector continued to expand.  Home sales and residential construction remained weak throughout most of the District, but conditions in commercial real estate markets continued to be positive.  Lending at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks increased from mid-June to mid-September.
The District's services sector continued to expand in most areas.  Contacts in the business support services and air transportation services industries announced plans to expand facilities and hire additional workers.  Retail sales were strong, fueled by back-to-school shopping, despite escalating credit problems and a weak housing market.  Auto sales were fairly steady in September compared with the same period last year.
Commercial real estate market conditions were mostly positive throughout the District.  Contacts in Evansville, IN, reported that commercial construction appears to be holding steady but that investors are more cautious.  Contacts in Little Rock reported that the number of new commercial construction permits for year-to-date August 2007 was up from the same period in 2006.  Contacts in Louisville reported that strong industrial construction will increase vacancy rates in the near term.
