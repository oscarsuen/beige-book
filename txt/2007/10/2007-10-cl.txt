The economy in the Fourth District continued to grow since late August, but at a slower pace than in the preceding reporting period.  The slowing is attributed primarily to a weakening in manufacturing output.  Most District home builders experienced a slight uptick in sales since our last report.  However, they see this as a seasonal adjustment rather than the beginning of an upward trend.  Activity in commercial construction was steady, with several builders citing a small decline in backlogs.  With the exception of food products, retail sales in the District were flat to declining.  Reports on business and consumer lending showed that, in general, demand was steady or had increased slightly.  The mortgage market remains sluggish, while the use of home equity lines of credit saw a slight rise.  Oil production was up slightly, while natural gas production declined.  And the demand for trucking and shipping services was stable.
Employment levels across the District were generally flat.  Staffing firms reported an increase in the number of job openings, primarily in the health-care industry, while the number of job seekers was flat.  The majority of staffing contacts told us that it is increasingly difficult to find quality job applicants.  Wage pressures were limited to the energy sector and some segments of the health-care and financial services sectors.  For the most part, supplier prices and material costs were stable.  Several manufacturers told us that they plan to increase product prices effective early in the fourth quarter.
About half of our contacts reported lower capacity utilization rates since our last report.  Most manufacturers also stated that capital expenditures were on plan.  Respondents who said that they are reducing capital spending cited the need to conserve cash as the reason.  During the fourth quarter, capital spending is expected to be consistent with levels seen earlier in the year.  When asked about input prices, we received a mixed response; however, a majority said prices were stable.  Global demand for raw materials and energy was the most often cited reason for elevated prices.  Only a few of the manufacturers surveyed have attempted to increase their own prices during the past six weeks.  However, several reported price increases will be going into effect early in the fourth quarter.  Employment levels were flat and hiring in the near future is expected to be very slow.  Wage pressures have not been an issue; however, a few manufacturers singled out rising health-care costs as a significant concern.
Most commercial contractors reported that business has been steady since late August as well as on a year-over-year basis.  Segments showing strong activity include health-care, education, and manufacturing, while general office space slowed.  Although a majority of our contacts are satisfied with their current backlogs, several have experienced a decline during the past few months.  Looking forward, nearly all contractors expect activity in 2008 to be at or near 2007 levels.  For the most part, material costs were stable during the past six weeks--though steel prices rose.  In turn, almost all builders held their own prices steady.  Workforce levels remain unchanged.
