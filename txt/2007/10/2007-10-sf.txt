The Twelfth District economy continued to expand during the survey period of September through early October, but it showed signs of further deceleration relative to the previous survey period of July and August.  Price inflation was modest with the exception of substantial increases in food prices, and increases in labor compensation were moderate on net but remained rapid for selected groups of skilled workers.  Sales by retailers and service providers continued to grow, but the pace of growth slowed slightly.  Manufacturers and agricultural producers saw further gains in output and sales.  Tighter lending standards took a toll in housing markets, exacerbating existing weakness in that sector, but demand for commercial real estate remained solid.  Banks noted slower growth in overall lending activity and a larger drop in new residential mortgages than was evident in prior survey periods.
Wage pressures were moderate on net, with contacts noting only small changes in overall labor costs.  Wage pressures continued to ease in Southern California because of slight loosening in labor markets this year.  In many parts of the District, compensation growth remained rapid for skilled workers in finance, engineering, marketing, and some other specialized fields.
Reports from service industries indicated slightly slower demand growth than in the last few survey periods.  Sales decelerated for advertising agencies and providers of media services, as weak demand for automobiles and home furnishings held down advertising expenditures by manufacturers and retailers in those sectors.  Demand growth for professional services, such as accounting and consulting, also slowed.  Tourism activity was mixed but positive on net; reports from Las Vegas suggested continued solid growth, while tourist visits and hotel occupancy rates have fallen slightly in Hawaii but remained high by historical standards.
