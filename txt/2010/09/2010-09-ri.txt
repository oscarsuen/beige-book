Signs of slowing or contracting economic activity became more prevalent in   the Fifth District since our last report. Manufacturing activity continued to   expand, but a slowdown in the pace of expansion that began several months ago   continued into August. Tourism also improved, although discounting was often   needed to attract visitors. We received mixed reports of activity at   services-providing firms, while retailers reported flat-to-weakening sales over   the last month. The financial and real estate sectors generally remained soft,   with several reports by residential Realtors indicating further declines in both   closed and pending home sales in recent months. The agricultural sector enjoyed   increased rainfall, but the benefits were too late for some crops. Survey   respondents in the retail sector cited cuts in the number of permanent job   hires, but temp agencies noted increased demand for workers from the   manufacturing sector.
On the commercial side, construction remained soft and there was continuing   downward pressure on rents. Several commercial Realtors stated that both   uncertainty about the economy and confusion about recent reforms were key   factors in holding back sales and construction. Most contacts noted that vacancy   rates were still rising. One developer attributed less demand for new building   space from small business startups to the fact that laid-off workers were facing   diminished savings due to the severe stock market and real estate slumps. In   addition, a paving materials supplier reported that local sales of crushed   stone, which is used as a base for laying concrete and other paving materials,   were non-existent. State and local governments cut back construction projects as   well, according to contacts.
