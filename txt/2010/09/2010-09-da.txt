The Eleventh District economy expanded modestly over the past six weeks. The   energy sector remained a source of strength, and agriculture, transportation   services and staffing firms reported solid growth. Retailers said sales rose,   but the pace of growth was slower. Reports from the manufacturing sector were   mixed, but overall suggest a slowdown. In particular, construction-related   manufacturers said demand was very weak as housing demand has retrenched and   private nonresidential activity is almost nonexistent. Most respondents expect   economic conditions to remain positive, although many expect slower growth   through year-end. Uncertainty was prevalent in most outlooks.
Crude oil prices fell below $73 per barrel by late August after a run up to   $82 earlier in the month. The price of gasoline, diesel and heating oil fell   during the reporting period, as inventories rose due to weak demand. Contacts   said natural gas prices edged down to just under $4 per Mcf by late August as   the national heat-wave subsided.
Manufacturers of high-tech products said demand held steady over the past six   weeks. Growth in orders has leveled off in recent months after a replenishment   of inventories earlier in the year that drove very strong growth. Most   respondents characterize current order levels as good. Although inventories have   increased, respondents said they are relatively lean and in some cases below   desired levels. Several semiconductor contacts said that industry-wide capacity   has fallen about 30 percent over the past three years and, even with growing   capital expenditures, capacity utilization is likely to remain very high for the   next two to three years. Outlooks were positive for the remainder of the   year.
Paper manufacturers reported flat to declining sales over the past six weeks.   Contacts said customers are very cautious about keeping inventories, due to   pessimistic economic outlooks. Growth in demand for food products stalled since   the last report. Respondents said they did not see the normal summer boost this   year.
Non-defense aircraft manufacturers said orders held steady over the past six   weeks and are above year-ago levels. Outlooks were cautiously optimistic.   Trailer producers said demand had fallen as uncertainty about the national   economy increased. Sales are expected to be slow through year-end.
Petrochemical producers were mostly optimistic, noting domestic orders were   strong and growing. Export growth was positive but slower, as current prices   were less competitive in Europe and Asia. The only reported weakness was for   vinyl products used in housing and commercial construction. Refiners noted   weaker conditions as seasonal gains in gasoline consumption did not materialize   and distillate (diesel and heating oil) consumption slipped back. Contacts   expect a decline in capacity utilization rates and refining runs due to weaker   margins.
Automobile demand held steady over the reporting period. Contacts said   inventories are at appropriate levels and manufacturers are incrementally   increasing production. Expectations are for continued modest improvement.
Demand for transportation services remains positive. Railroad respondents   noted a broad-based increase in cargo volumes, with shipments of grain products   recording the largest increase. Shipping firms said small parcel cargo volumes   rose, while large freight shipments declined during the reporting period.   Intermodal transportation firms reported a modest increase in shipments. Airline   traffic was flat to slightly down since the last report, but is stronger than a   year ago. The outlook is for continued stability in air travel demand.
Nonresidential construction remains weak. Contacts reported a notable lack of   private nonresidential projects. Public construction is the main source of   activity for most contacts, but some expressed concern that such projects would   subside due to budget constraints.
