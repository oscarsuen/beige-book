The Ninth District economy grew modestly since the last report. Consumer   spending, tourism, residential construction, services, manufacturing, energy,   mining and agriculture saw increases. Activity in the commercial and residential   real estate sectors decreased, while commercial construction remained weak.   Labor markets strengthened slightly since the last report. Wage increases were   moderate, and prices increased modestly.
Vehicle sales were up slightly in North Dakota, according to a representative   of an auto dealers association. The owner of a Minnesota domestic auto dealer   said that August sales were up from a year ago, but corporate customers were   more cautious about purchases.
Despite recent strengthening, overall labor market conditions remained weak.   In Minnesota, a hospital recently announced plans to eliminate up to 250   full-time positions by year-end. Two Minnesota state universities announced   layoffs of almost 40 tenure-track faculty in anticipation of future funding   cuts. There were plenty of qualified applicants available to fill open positions   in Montana. In addition, fewer foreign workers were needed to fill seasonal jobs   in Montana this past summer compared with a year ago.
Wage increases were moderate. Average wages for manufacturing employees in   District states for the three-month period ended in July 2010 were only 1   percent higher than the same period a year ago. A nurses union in Duluth, Minn.,   called for a one-day strike; staffing levels were the primary issue. In Montana,   a bank director noted that a number of employers were uncertain about their   obligations under the new health care system and therefore were hesitant to make   long-term commitments regarding benefits.
Overall prices increased modestly. Minnesota gasoline prices decreased   slightly from mid-July through the end of August. Fertilizer prices were lower   than a year ago. Meanwhile, prices for copper and lead increased from mid-July   through the end of August.
