The economy of the Eighth District has grown modestly since our previous   report. Economic activity in the manufacturing sector increased, on balance, as   did activity in the services sector. While retail sales reports were mixed, auto   sales in July and early August increased over a year ago. Residential real   estate markets held steady and commercial real estate activity remained slow.   Overall lending activity at a sample of large District banks was largely   unchanged during the three-month period ending in July.
Car dealers in the District reported that, compared with last year, sales in   July and early August were up, on average. About 44 percent of the car dealers   surveyed saw increases in sales, while 32 percent saw decreases and 24 percent   saw no changes. Just under half of the car dealers noted that used car sales had   increased relative to new car sales, while 12 percent reported the opposite.   Also, 20 percent reported more acceptances of finance applications, but 12   percent reported more rejections. A slight majority of the car dealers surveyed   reported that their inventories were too low, while 12 percent reported that   their inventories were too high. The sales outlook among the car dealers for   September and October was generally optimistic. About 56 percent of the car   dealers expect sales to increase over 2009 levels, but 16 percent expect sales   to decrease. The remaining 28 percent expect sales to be similar to last   year.
The District's services sector also has continued to improve since our   previous report. Firms in the transportation, business support,   telecommunications, and government services industries expanded existing   operations and hired new employees. Additionally, firms in the restaurant   industry opened several new facilities. In contrast, contacts in the business   support services and janitorial services industries reported plans to decrease   operations and lay off workers.
Demand conditions in commercial and industrial real estate markets were   mixed, while activity in the sector remained weak. Compared with the first   quarter of 2010, second-quarter 2010 industrial vacancy rates decreased in St.   Louis but increased in Little Rock and Memphis; vacancy rates remained stable in   Louisville over the same period. The downtown office vacancy rate decreased in   Little Rock, Louisville, and Memphis but increased in St. Louis. During the same   period, suburban office vacancy rates decreased in Little Rock and Memphis but   increased in Louisville and St. Louis. A contact in south central Kentucky   reported that commercial construction is steady but there are concerns that the   pipeline for new projects is lean. A commercial constructing contact in   northeast Arkansas reported that projects are few and for the most part small,   with some activity in education-related projects. A contact in St. Louis   reported that construction of office and warehouse spaces has been limited. In   contrast, contacts in the northeast Mississippi region have reported significant   industrial construction plans.
