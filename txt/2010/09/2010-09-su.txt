Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco   based on information collected on or before August 30, 2010. This document   summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the   Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve   officials.
Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggested continued growth   in national economic activity during the reporting period of mid-July through   the end of August, but with widespread signs of a deceleration compared with   preceding periods. Economic growth at a modest pace was the most common   characterization of overall conditions, as provided by the five western   Districts of St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The   reports from Boston and Cleveland also pointed to positive developments or net   improvements compared with the previous reporting period. However, the remaining   Districts of New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago all   highlighted mixed conditions or deceleration in overall economic   activity.
Upward price pressures remained quite limited for most categories of final   goods and services, despite higher prices for selected commodities such as   grains and some industrial materials. Wage pressures also were limited, although   a few Districts noted increased upward pressures in a narrow set of sectors   experiencing a mismatch between job requirements and applicant skills.
Reports from most Districts pointed to consistent gains in travel and tourist   activity, with pickups evident in the business and leisure segments alike. New   York reported strong tourist activity that kept hotel occupancy rates high in   Manhattan despite an increase in hotel capacity this year, while Boston noted   that travel and tourism activity was "stronger than expected." Several other   Districts also reported rising visitor counts and hotel occupancies, notably for   popular tourist destinations in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco   Districts, although several pointed to continued softness in per-visitor   spending. Atlanta noted reduced tourist activity in areas of the Gulf Coast   affected by the oil spill but improvements over last year in unaffected areas.   Airline traffic was stable to up, with Boston pointing to an expanded number of   low-fare carriers.
Reports on capacity utilization were mixed. Manufacturers of high-tech   products have been operating near maximum capacity of late, although this partly   reflects a substantial decline in industry-wide capacity over the past three   years, as noted by Dallas. More generally, the majority of Cleveland's   manufacturing contacts reported that capacity utilization remained below   pre-recession levels. Capital spending plans for manufacturers and firms in   other industries generally indicate little change or modest increases in coming   months, based on reports from the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago,   Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.
Demand for commercial, industrial, and retail space generally remained   depressed. Vacancy rates stayed at elevated levels in general and rose further   in a few Districts, placing substantial downward pressure on rents. Asking rents   continued to decline in parts of the New York and Kansas City Districts. High   vacancies and negative absorption held nonresidential construction activity to   the bare minimum in most Districts. A few Districts reported exceptions to weak   conditions. Cleveland noted improved construction activity for industrial use   and educational infrastructure; this raised overall activity above year-earlier   levels and prompted modest hiring by builders. Chicago reported an increase in   inquiries for commercial redevelopment and rising construction activity for   public projects, but Richmond reported that state and local governments cut back   on construction projects.
Lending standards were largely unchanged. However, New York reported tighter   standards in all lending categories, particularly for commercial mortgages, and   Kansas City reported that a few banks tightened standards for commercial real   estate loans. By contrast, reports from Chicago indicated that credit   availability and terms loosened for business and consumer loans. Credit quality   also changed little on balance. Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco noted   modest improvements in overall credit quality, while New York reported rising   delinquencies for all categories except consumer loans and Atlanta reported an   increase in business and household bankruptcies.
Demand and extraction activity increased for producers of natural resource   products, including oil and other items used for energy output. Rising global   demand spurred expanded extraction activity for oil, natural gas, and assorted   minerals, as reported by Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas,   and San Francisco. In the Atlanta District, oil production was barely affected   by the Gulf oil spill, although contacts noted lingering concerns about the   longer-term business impacts of the deepwater drilling moratorium and higher   liability insurance costs for oil extraction companies.
Wage pressures remained modest overall. Of Districts commenting on wages,   most identified little or no upward pressures or increases. Dallas reported that   wage pressures were "generally nonexistent," with the exceptions of some airline   and temporary workers. Hiring of permanent employees was held down in part by   employers' reliance on temporary and contract workers, as reported by   Philadelphia and Atlanta, although Boston noted that conversions from temporary   to permanent staff picked up. Contacts in the Boston, Chicago, and Kansas City   Districts noted skill mismatches between available jobs and the workers applying   for them, which caused a slight uptick in wage pressures for selected jobs in a   narrow set of industries. More generally, however, the reports suggested ample   supply of qualified applicants for open positions.
