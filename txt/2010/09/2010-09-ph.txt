Business conditions in the Third District have been mixed since the last   Beige Book. Manufacturers, on balance, reported slight decreases in shipments   and new orders in August. Retailers posted seasonal increases in sales as well   as year-over-year gains. Motor vehicle dealers also generally posted   year-over-year gains but indicated that sales have been only steady in recent   weeks. Third District banks reported steady loan volume outstanding in the past   few weeks. Residential real estate agents and homebuilders said that there has   been no rebound from the sharp drop in home sales that followed the expiration   of the federal tax credit for purchases. Contacts in the commercial real estate   sector said there has been practically no change since the last Beige Book in   the generally weak market conditions around the District. Service-sector firms   reported mostly flat or very slight increases in activity since mid-summer.   Business firms in the region indicated that prices of most goods and services   have been steady, although there continued to be reports of increased prices for   some metals and wood products. Several retailers said they were receiving   indications from suppliers that wholesale prices will be increased toward the   end of the year.
The outlook among Third District business contacts is positive but not   strong. Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next   six months. Retailers expect sales to expand slightly but see no signs that the   pace of growth will quicken. Bankers expect little or no growth in lending in   the near term. Contacts in both residential and commercial real estate expect   flat activity during the rest of the year. Service-sector companies expect slow   growth for the rest of the year.
Third District manufacturers reported   slight decreases in shipments and new orders from July to August, on balance, as   well as a decrease in order backlogs. Slower activity was reported in most of   the major manufacturing sectors in the District. However, producers of wood   products, food products, industrial materials, and measuring and testing   equipment reported increased demand for their products.
Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance. Among the firms surveyed in August, about 40   percent expect increases in new orders and shipments, and about 20 percent   expect decreases. Capital spending plans among area manufacturers remain   positive, overall, but are not strong. About one-third of the firms polled in   August plan to increase expenditures for new plant and equipment, and about   one-fifth expect to reduce spending. Several manufacturing executives indicated   that uncertainties about economic conditions and policies were deterring   advances in business activity. One noted that, "There is no sign of sustainable   improvement in demand, so we remain cautious about inventories, capital   spending, and hiring." Another said, "Investment spending is not increasing   because of concern about tax increases on business owners."
Third District retailers reported that sales rose   from July to August for the back-to-school shopping period, and most of the   stores surveyed posted year-over-year gains for the period. Store executives   continued to note that much of the year-over-year improvement in sales has been   a consequence of last year's poor results; nevertheless, many said the   fundamental trend in sales was beginning to strengthen. Some merchants noted   relatively healthy sales of apparel and small appliances, albeit with   significant discounting, but weak sales of big-ticket consumer electronic   products. Most store executives described inventories as being in line with   current and expected sales. Looking ahead, most of the retailers contacted for   this report said they expected modest growth in sales through the end of the   year. The consensus was reflected in the comment of one store executive, "We are   in a recovery, but it will not get stronger until employment increases."
Third District auto dealers reported roughly steady sales during July and   August at a rate somewhat above the year-ago pace. Dealers expect sales to   continue to run at about the current rate for the rest of the year. However,   some dealers said manufacturers' incentives are supporting sales of current   model-year vehicles, and sales could slip when that supply is depleted and   replaced by new model-year vehicles.
Tourism officials and industry executives in the region generally reported   increased activity compared with last year, although most noted that overall   business remained below the levels of 2007 and 2008. Contacts indicated that   travel and tourism revenue was only modestly above the year-ago level as lower   spending per person partially offset increased numbers of people visiting the   region's tourist attractions.
Total outstanding loan volume at most of the   Third District banks contacted for this report has been virtually level since   the last Beige Book. Commercial bank lending officers said there has been a   slight increase in credit extended on home equity lines, but practically no   change in outstandings in other credit categories. Bankers continued to report   low demand for both consumer and business loans. "It's still a deleveraging   story," one banker said. Commercial bank officers indicated that credit quality   has been steady or has improved slightly since the last Beige Book.
Looking ahead, Third District bankers expect little, if any, growth until   both consumer and business confidence strengthen. Some bankers said business   lending could begin to move up in the near term, but the consensus was that loan   growth overall will be slight until there are clear signs that economic   conditions are improving.
Contacts in residential real   estate markets reported that the low rate of sales that took hold after the   expiration of the federal income tax credit for home purchases has persisted   into July and August for both new and existing homes. For both new and existing   homes, contacts reported little change in prices, and they noted that   lower-priced homes continued to sell at a relatively better pace than   higher-priced homes. Residential real estate contacts expect sales to remain   slow during the fall and winter. Although the inventory of homes for sale has   not changed much recently, some contacts expect an increase in the spring of   next year. One agent said, "A lot of people who don't need to sell right now   have taken their homes off the market, and they will probably jump back in as   soon as the market appears to be coming back."
Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that there has been little change   in commercial and industrial markets since the last Beige Book. Contacts   reported that purchases of income-producing properties by investors have picked   up somewhat, but they said that commercial construction activity remains very   slow, and there are few, if any, indications that new projects will be started   in the near future. Commercial real estate contacts expect market conditions to   show little change for at least the rest of the year. They believe that recent   increases in available space are likely to restrain lease rates and, as one   said, "Put a damper on future construction."
Service-sector firms generally reported minimal   gains or flat rates of activity since the previous Beige Book. A large business   services firm reported that client companies were not contracting for as much   business as they had indicated earlier in the year. Several health-care   organizations noted recent flattening in activity that is interrupting a long   growth trend. In contrast, some temporary employment agencies noted that demand   had picked up recently. Looking ahead, most of the services firms contacted for   this report expect growth to be slow for the rest of the year. Some have reduced   their forecasts; as one contact said, "It looks like we were a little too   optimistic earlier this year."
Reports on input costs and output prices   indicate little change since the last Beige Book. Most of the manufacturing   firms polled in August reported no change from July in the costs of the   commodities they use or the products they make. However, producers of primary   metals and wood products raised prices. Construction firms gave mixed reports on   prices, with some noting steady materials costs and some indicating increases   for a variety of materials. Retailers generally noted that both wholesale costs   and retail prices have been mostly steady, although several indicated that they   expect wholesale price increases from their suppliers during the fourth quarter   of this year.
Business firms in the region reported no significant change in wages.   Employment agencies reported that client companies have begun to fill positions   that have been open but do not appear to be adding employees. Some staffing   firms said client companies are looking to rely more on temporary and contract   workers to meet variable and uncertain workloads, rather than hiring permanent   employees.
