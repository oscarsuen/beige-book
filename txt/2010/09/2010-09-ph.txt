Business conditions in the Third District have been mixed since the last   Beige Book. Manufacturers, on balance, reported slight decreases in shipments   and new orders in August. Retailers posted seasonal increases in sales as well   as year-over-year gains. Motor vehicle dealers also generally posted   year-over-year gains but indicated that sales have been only steady in recent   weeks. Third District banks reported steady loan volume outstanding in the past   few weeks. Residential real estate agents and homebuilders said that there has   been no rebound from the sharp drop in home sales that followed the expiration   of the federal tax credit for purchases. Contacts in the commercial real estate   sector said there has been practically no change since the last Beige Book in   the generally weak market conditions around the District. Service-sector firms   reported mostly flat or very slight increases in activity since mid-summer.   Business firms in the region indicated that prices of most goods and services   have been steady, although there continued to be reports of increased prices for   some metals and wood products. Several retailers said they were receiving   indications from suppliers that wholesale prices will be increased toward the   end of the year.
The outlook among Third District business contacts is positive but not   strong. Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next   six months. Retailers expect sales to expand slightly but see no signs that the   pace of growth will quicken. Bankers expect little or no growth in lending in   the near term. Contacts in both residential and commercial real estate expect   flat activity during the rest of the year. Service-sector companies expect slow   growth for the rest of the year.
Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance. Among the firms surveyed in August, about 40   percent expect increases in new orders and shipments, and about 20 percent   expect decreases. Capital spending plans among area manufacturers remain   positive, overall, but are not strong. About one-third of the firms polled in   August plan to increase expenditures for new plant and equipment, and about   one-fifth expect to reduce spending. Several manufacturing executives indicated   that uncertainties about economic conditions and policies were deterring   advances in business activity. One noted that, "There is no sign of sustainable   improvement in demand, so we remain cautious about inventories, capital   spending, and hiring." Another said, "Investment spending is not increasing   because of concern about tax increases on business owners."
Third District auto dealers reported roughly steady sales during July and   August at a rate somewhat above the year-ago pace. Dealers expect sales to   continue to run at about the current rate for the rest of the year. However,   some dealers said manufacturers' incentives are supporting sales of current   model-year vehicles, and sales could slip when that supply is depleted and   replaced by new model-year vehicles.
Tourism officials and industry executives in the region generally reported   increased activity compared with last year, although most noted that overall   business remained below the levels of 2007 and 2008. Contacts indicated that   travel and tourism revenue was only modestly above the year-ago level as lower   spending per person partially offset increased numbers of people visiting the   region's tourist attractions.
Looking ahead, Third District bankers expect little, if any, growth until   both consumer and business confidence strengthen. Some bankers said business   lending could begin to move up in the near term, but the consensus was that loan   growth overall will be slight until there are clear signs that economic   conditions are improving.
Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that there has been little change   in commercial and industrial markets since the last Beige Book. Contacts   reported that purchases of income-producing properties by investors have picked   up somewhat, but they said that commercial construction activity remains very   slow, and there are few, if any, indications that new projects will be started   in the near future. Commercial real estate contacts expect market conditions to   show little change for at least the rest of the year. They believe that recent   increases in available space are likely to restrain lease rates and, as one   said, "Put a damper on future construction."
Business firms in the region reported no significant change in wages.   Employment agencies reported that client companies have begun to fill positions   that have been open but do not appear to be adding employees. Some staffing   firms said client companies are looking to rely more on temporary and contract   workers to meet variable and uncertain workloads, rather than hiring permanent   employees.
