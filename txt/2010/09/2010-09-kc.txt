Growth in the Tenth District economy was modest in late July and August.   Consumer spending increased slightly from the previous period, and high-tech and   transportation firms reported moderate growth. Energy activity continued to   expand solidly, and agricultural conditions improved with higher crop prices.   Manufacturing production was flat, and factory orders declined slightly. The   downturn in commercial real estate eased somewhat, while residential real estate   markets weakened further. Bankers reported steady loan demand and an unchanged   outlook for loan quality. Business contacts were moderately optimistic about   future sales, but few planned to change employment or capital spending levels in   the months ahead. Retail prices were largely unchanged from the previous survey,   and wage pressures in most industries remained limited due to soft labor   markets.
