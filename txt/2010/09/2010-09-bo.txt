Recent business developments are positive on average across the First   District, but performance continues to vary between and within sectors. Reports   are mostly upbeat among contacts in software and IT. Manufacturing firms also   had mostly positive news, with recent sales at least steady for most and very   strong in some cases. Among staffing services, positive developments outnumber   negative ones. Retailers give mixed results, including some significant sales   declines. In the commercial real estate market, leasing activity is flat to   modest and downward pressure on rents remains high in Boston. Residential real   estate sales are very weak following the expiration of the home-buyer tax credit   but selling prices are up slightly in many parts of the region. Concerning the   labor market, some firms are hiring modestly or plan to hire soon, while others   are still reluctant to hire. The number of job-seekers is perceived as high by   some, while others are having difficulty filling vacancies requiring specific   skills. Some software and IT firms are giving significant pay raises and   staffing firms also note an increased willingness to pay higher wages among some   firms. Constraints in ocean-freight capacity are a concern among manufacturers   and retailers, as are increases in commodity prices. The outlook varies widely   across sectors, from largely positive in manufacturing and software to cautious   in retail and tourism and mixed among commercial real estate professionals.
Travel and tourism are stronger than expected. One contact attributes the   trend to generous travel incentives, supported by an increase in the number of   low-fare air carriers operating out of Boston. Overseas arrivals are much   stronger than forecast. Business travel is also more robust than anticipated,   with travel managers using the downturn to leverage favorable rates. The   respondent reports modest hiring in the visitor industry, although the outlook   remains cautious.
Inventory levels at many contacted firms are reportedly low in comparison   with pre-recession levels. One firm remarks that, even if demand were to slow,   it would not be as damaging as in 2008 because most goods are being produced   only as orders arrive. Low inventory levels are also attributed to supply   constraints. A number of firms report that suppliers are producing at capacity   due to cuts in capacity in 2008 and 2009. In addition, inputs for one firm have   been slow to arrive because of cutbacks in global ocean-freight capacity. These   constraints have led at least one contact to stockpile intermediate inputs as a   hedge. Despite supply constraints, almost all respondents report that selling   prices remain relatively steady, although some note continued fluctuations in   raw materials prices. Some firms passed modest price increases on to their   customers.
Hiring remains limited among the manufacturing firms surveyed. The companies   that cut workforces substantially during the recession are slowly re-hiring   workers, although employment at most of these firms remains below 2008 levels.   Some firms expect hiring to pick up next year, although one firm wants to see   sustained growth before making major hiring plans. A few semiconductor and   pharmaceutical firms continue to have difficulties filling skilled positions.   Capital spending plans at most manufacturers remain moderate, as some firm's   upgraded IT infrastructure and other equipment. A number of firms characterize   the investment environment as favorable but had not yet found good   opportunities.
Many firms remain optimistic about growth going forward. One contact notes   that demand is much stronger than what news reports suggest. By contrast, a few   firms are not as optimistic as they were three months ago. Firms again mention   being concerned about the uncertainty of fiscal policy going forward.
The number of homes and condos on the market increased around the District. A   couple of respondents in Massachusetts expect the increased inventory, and   resulting greater choice, to lure more buyers to the market; conversely, a New   Hampshire contact is concerned about the excess supply of homes. The median   price of homes and condos moved up in most parts in New England. Such moves are   attributed to a greater fraction of sales coming from higher-end properties   rather than to a general increase in prices. The only exception to this trend is   New Hampshire, where prices fell 1 percent year-over-year. Contacts expect   prices to remain stable in the coming months, although they anticipate slower   sales for the rest of year due to the expiration of the tax credit and perceived   lack of job security.
