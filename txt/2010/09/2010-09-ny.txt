On balance, the Second District's economy showed signs of decelerating since   the last report. Input prices have continued to rise moderately, while consumer   prices appear to be steady to down slightly. General merchandise retailers   report that sales have slowed since the last report, though auto dealers   categorize sales as fairly good. Commercial real estate markets have generally   been steady to softer since the last report. Residential real estate sales   markets weakened to very low levels, though New York City's rental market   continued to improve modestly. Manufacturing-sector contacts report some further   deceleration in business activity. Tourism activity in New York City has been   steady at a strong level since the last report, buoyed by rising business   travel. Overall, the labor market, though still slack, has shown further modest   signs of improvement. Finally, bankers report steady to weaker loan demand,   steady to higher delinquency rates and some tightening in credit standards, but   also some narrowing in loan spreads.
Auto dealers in the Rochester area report that sales of new autos were down   roughly 10 percent from a year ago in July and down 15 to 20 percent in the   first half of August, while Buffalo-area dealers report a 5 percent   year-over-year increase in July and project a moderate decline in August. Still,   contacts in both areas describe the current sales pace as fairly good, with the   12-month comparisons depressed by last summer's "Cash for clunkers" program.   Dealers report that both retail and floor-plan credit conditions have continued   to improve.
Tourism activity in New York City has been steady at a strong level since the   last report. Manhattan hotels report that occupancy rates remained close to 90   percent in July and August, even as the number of hotel rooms has risen by more   than 5 percent over the past year. Moreover, room rates continued to run 10-15   percent ahead of this time last year. Business travel has reportedly increased   in recent months, accounting for a growing share of revenues. Broadway theaters   report that attendance picked up a bit in the latter part of July and remained   brisk in August--up roughly 5 percent from a year earlier, though the average   ticket price was down 4 percent in August from comparable 2009 levels. Overall   revenues were up moderately from a year earlier in July but flat in the first   three weeks of August.
In New York City, conditions were more mixed. Activity in the city's co-op   and condo market has fallen off by somewhat more than the seasonal norm in July   and August, following a brisk second quarter; activity has dropped off   particularly sharply on Long Island and, in general, at the lower end of the   market. A leading appraisal firm reports that prices remain essentially flat in   Manhattan and across New York City generally. The appraisal business has   reportedly remained strong. Manhattan's rental market, though still somewhat   slack, has continued to recover: rental activity has remained stable at a   moderate level, while effective rents have rebounded--contract rents have risen   only modestly, but landlords are offer fewer concessions (i.e. fewer months free   rent). A considerable volume of new development will be coming onto the market,   probably largely as rentals, in the months ahead.
Office markets across the District were generally steady to weaker since the   last report. Vacancy rates were steady throughout most of the District, though   they increased modestly in Manhattan and the Albany area. Asking rents were also   little changed overall; they edged up in the Long Island and Syracuse areas but   edged down in the northern New Jersey and Albany markets. Asking rents are still   down sharply from a year ago in Manhattan and down moderately in Long Island and   northern New Jersey; however, rents are up from a year ago in the Buffalo,   Syracuse and Albany areas. Industrial markets were also steady to weaker across   the District since the last report. Industrial vacancy rates rose modestly   across the New York City metro area and held steady in the Buffalo and Rochester   areas. Asking rents were generally down 3-4 percent from a year ago.
A major NYC employment agency, specializing in office jobs, reports that,   while the job market is difficult to gauge during the slow summer season, market   conditions appear to be improving gradually and conditions are not as dire as   last summer. The pool of available candidates is not as large as it was last   summer; however, some people who had given up looking are starting to come   back.
