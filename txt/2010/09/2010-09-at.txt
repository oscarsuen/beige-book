Sixth District business contacts indicated that the pace of economic activity   continued to slow in July and August. Retailers reported a decrease in traffic   and sales, and their outlook was less positive than in previous months. Reports   from the District's tourism sector were mixed as contacts outside of the   oil-spill affected Gulf coast experienced positive growth, but areas from   Louisiana to the Florida panhandle saw significant declines in visitors.   Residential real estate contacts noted that the pace of new and existing home   sales slowed, and their outlook remained pessimistic. Nonresidential real estate   activity remained weak. Manufacturers reported that the pace of new orders   growth slowed. Banking credit conditions remained constrained and loan demand   was reportedly weak. Labor markets improved modestly, but most businesses   maintained a strong preference for increasing the hours worked of existing staff   and expanding their use of temporary hires rather than for hiring permanent   employees. Transportation and material prices rose slightly, but most firms   expressed limited ability to pass increases through to consumers.
The oil spill had a negative impact on tourism along the affected Gulf Coast.   Outside of areas affected by the oil spill, tourism continued to show signs of   improvement compared with last year. Hospitality contacts in Miami, Nashville,   New Orleans, and Orlando experienced increasing hotel occupancy rates in July   and August. In addition, northeast Florida, Georgia, and mountain resorts in   Tennessee saw an increase in activity--some reportedly as a result of deflected   business from the oil affected areas. The cruise-line industry cited a pickup in   traffic and a modest increase in prices.
District contacts reported increases in commodity and transportation-related   prices compared with a year ago. Most firms conveyed no plans to pass the   increases on to consumers, opting instead to continue to internalize cost   pressures through a combination of lower margins and increased efficiencies.
Limited rainfall, coupled with hot temperatures, challenged crops and   livestock in most District areas. Short topsoil moisture levels were widely   reported across the District. In addition, dry weather conditions have pushed   some growers to an early harvest season.
