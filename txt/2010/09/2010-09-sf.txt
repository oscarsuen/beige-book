Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to expand modestly during   the reporting period of mid-July through the end of August. Upward pressures on   prices and wages were quite limited. Sales of retail items and services were   mixed but grew on balance. District manufacturing activity firmed a bit further,   with continued strength evident for manufacturers of information technology   products. Agricultural producers reported robust sales, and demand strengthened   further for energy resources. Activity in District housing markets continued to   slide, while demand for commercial real estate remained weak. Contacts from   financial institutions reported slight declines in lending activity but further   improvements in credit quality.
Upward wage pressures were largely absent, as high unemployment and limited   demand for new employees held down compensation gains in most regions and   sectors. Contacts continued to report significant increases in the costs of   employee benefits, most notably for health insurance. Reports indicated that   most businesses remain cautious in their approach to hiring and continue to rely   on improved productivity rather than increased employment as a means to expand   output.
Demand for services improved modestly on balance but remained lackluster   overall. Demand for professional, media, and entertainment services was mixed   across sectors but appeared to be largely stable at low levels on net. Providers   of energy services reported stronger demand for industrial use, with the   exception of wood products. Contacts from around the District noted increased   business travel and tourism activity, as reflected in higher visitor volumes,   hotel occupancy rates, and airline passenger miles, although visitor spending   remained weak. Providers of health-care services reported that demand slipped   somewhat, which they attributed in part to rising postponements or cancellations   of elective procedures and routine tests by individuals who lack health   insurance.
