On balance, economic activity in the Fourth District showed a slight   improvement during the past six weeks. Manufacturers reported that new orders   and production levels were stable or marginally lower. An uptick was seen in   residential and nonresidential construction, while retailers and auto dealers   experienced a small rise in sales. Reports from energy producers and freight   haulers were generally favorable. Demand by businesses and consumers for new   loans remained weak.
The pace of new hiring has diminished, with only scattered reports of   increased payrolls from manufacturers, nonresidential builders, and auto   dealers. Overall, staffing-firm representatives noted little change in the   number of new job openings, with available openings concentrated in healthcare   and the skilled trades. Wage pressures continue to be contained. Apart from a   rise in steel and agricultural commodity prices, raw materials and product   pricing were generally stable.
Only minor shifts in inventories were noted, mostly on the up side. A   majority of our contacts stated that utilization rates remain below   pre-recession levels, with little change during the past few weeks. Capital   outlays continue at relatively low levels, with any significant increases due to   investment projects that had been previously delayed. Steel producers and   service center representatives reported that raw material prices are rising,   although most indicated that their product pricing remains reasonably stable. A   few have announced price increases that will go into effect as early as   September. Other than a sharp rise in agricultural commodity prices, raw   material costs have been fairly steady. We heard only scattered reports of   companies hiring new workers, although several firms have extended work hours.   Wage pressures are contained.
Reports by nonresidential builders indicate some improvement in construction   activity since our last report. When comparing to year-ago levels, activity is   as good or better according to almost all of our contacts. Backlogs are   reasonably healthy, though two builders noted that their backlogs are being   depleted at a rapid pace. Inquiries and new projects generally fall within the   industrial and education categories. Most of our contacts expect little change   in business conditions during the next 6 to 12 months, citing some weakness in   inquiries and uncertainty about economic growth. Reports of a small increase in   construction material costs, especially for steel, were widespread, and the   availability of project financing has improved slightly. General contractors   cited an uptick in payrolls. Subcontractors remain underutilized and are taking   on projects at cost.
Auto dealers saw new vehicle sales strengthen from mid-July through   mid-August, when compared with the previous 30 days. Reports also showed   improving sales on a year-over-year basis. Expectations call for vehicle   purchases to stabilize at current levels in the upcoming months. Many dealers   continue to say that their inventories are at low levels. Used vehicle purchases   are beginning to soften. Interest rates for auto loans are competitive, although   arranging financing for customers with less than high credit ratings remains a   challenge. Several auto dealers noted that they are undertaking facility   upgrades to comply with OEM demands, and they are doing incremental hiring to   meet customer demand.
