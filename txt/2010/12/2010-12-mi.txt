Tourism activity increased. Minnesota deer hunting licenses sold through   mid-November were up 2 percent from the same period a year ago. In South Dakota,   nonresident small game hunting licenses sold through October were up 1 percent   from the same period a year ago.
Commercial real   estate remained weak. Vacancy rates in Minneapolis-St. Paul were near record   levels for office and industrial space, and very few large transactions were   noted. A commercial real estate broker in Fargo described activity there as   "slow and steady," with few purchases but some recent large leasing deals.   Residential real estate activity dropped due in part to problems closing   transactions for bank-owned properties. October pending sales in Minneapolis-St.   Paul fell 36 percent from the previous year, while inventories increased and   prices were flat. Sales decreased slightly in Sioux Falls, but average prices   increased.
Wage increases were generally modest. A contact in the information technology   sector said that he expects continued depressed wage levels in software   development. In contrast, pressure on wages in oil-producing areas of western   North Dakota and eastern Montana had some fast food restaurants offering as much   as $13 per hour with signing bonuses.
Prices remained relatively level with some exceptions noted. Mid-November   Minnesota gasoline prices were about the same as early October, but diesel fuel   prices increased. A Minnesota-based food producer recently announced price   increases for some of its cereals and baking products due to increased commodity   and grain expenses. A bank director noted that fertilizer prices have increased   over the past few months.
