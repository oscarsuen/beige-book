Overall, most business owners suggested that the lack of robust sales growth   was the major factor holding back their hiring plans and their demand for   credit, although several also cited ongoing tax and regulatory policy   uncertainty as additional constraining factors. Limited capital spending was   focused primarily on required maintenance and efforts to increase   efficiencies.
Tourism activity improved relative to a year earlier and the outlook was   generally positive for the holiday season. Hotel occupancy rates rose in several   of the District's major markets compared to last year and cruise bookings were   strong. However, discretionary spending at both hotels and cruise ships was   relatively soft. International visitors remained a major source of tourism   growth in the District. Contacts also reported solid increases in business   travel and group travel bookings.
Nonresidential construction activity softened across the District.   Contractors noted that the pace of commercial development was below the   year-earlier level and backlogs remained low. Vacancy rates remained elevated   across much of the region, although modest improvements were noted in leasing   activity. Most contacts expect the commercial real estate market to remain weak   over the next year.
Business contacts expressed considerable uncertainty about cost pressures   over the coming year. Most felt that any pressure from higher labor and   materials costs would be largely absorbed by reductions in profit margins.   Overall, businesses remained reluctant to pass higher input costs through to   customers given the relative softness in sales and orders. However, some   transportation and food service firms indicated they plan to raise some of their   prices because of cost increases.
Most District areas benefitted from improved weather conditions in late   October and early November. The outlook for the region's key agricultural   products was brightened by favorable market conditions. Strong global demand and   tight supplies have particularly boosted soybean and cotton prices, recently   reaching historic highs.
