Reports of rising payrolls in manufacturing, banking, and auto dealerships   increased slightly since our last survey. Overall, staffing-firm representatives   noted little change in the number of new job openings, with vacancies   concentrated in the healthcare sector. Wage pressures continue to be contained.   Apart from volatility in commodity prices, raw materials and product pricing   were fairly steady.
Capacity utilization is trending up for some manufacturers and steel   producers, while the majority said that utilization rates still remain below   pre-recession levels. Inventories are balanced with incoming orders. Although   there has been some increase in capital outlays, most producers are conservative   in their planning. Several noted that new spending will be directed at their   offshore facilities. Other than volatility in steel and commodity prices, the   cost of raw materials has been relatively stable. Several manufacturers   announced selective product price increases to reflect changes in steel, copper,   and agricultural input prices. We heard a few reports that these adjustments are   expected to become more widespread in 2011. About half of our contacts told us   that they have expanded their payrolls slightly since our last report. Wage   pressures are contained.
Discussions with nonresidential builders drew mixed responses. A majority of   our contacts reported having less work than a year ago and seeing a slowdown in   inquiries. Several builders characterized their backlogs as acceptable, but   noted that they were down year-over-year. New projects are generally falling   into the infrastructure category. The general consensus is for little change in   business conditions in the near term. On balance, construction material prices   have been stable. Two general contractors reported reducing their payrolls,   while other builders said employment was steady. Subcontractors are still   struggling and bidding at very competitive rates. Reports indicate that it is   very difficult for subs to obtain credit.
Most auto dealers saw a pickup in new vehicle sales during October on a   month-over-month basis. Looking forward, dealers expect sales to follow seasonal   trends through the winter months. However, they anticipate that volume will be   higher than the prior yearâ€™s level. New car inventories rose during the past few   weeks. Used vehicle purchases are flattening out since our last report. Little   change in lending standards was reported, while credit pricing remains very   competitive. We heard a few reports of incremental hiring at dealerships.
