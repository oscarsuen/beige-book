Commercial real estate activity was generally weak since our last report, but   property managers were becoming more optimistic about the near term. A Baltimore   developer described commercial property demand as spotty, but he expected a   pickup in demand from local "feds, meds, and eds." A developer of residential   complexes reported that his numbers have improved in recent weeks, but the   volume of transactions remained extremely low. A commercial Realtor in North   Carolina noted that rental rates were flat at low levels, but property owners   were able to avoid making negative cash-flow deals. In contrast, the owner of an   elevator repair service reported that businesses were spending again--partly to   maintain safety standards, but also to modernize in anticipation of a pickup in   business activity. A commercial architect said that he could now "see light at   the end of the tunnel" and was able to proceed with several projects that had   been on hold for well over a year. A contact in the D.C., area said that   architectural firms were hiring again. Nonetheless, most contractors continued   to report no speculative building, and a contractor in central Virginia said   that his region had only a few closings for new construction (mostly government   projects).
