Manufacturing activity picked up in October   and November after a slight easing in September. An auto-parts supplier in the   District said that auto manufacturers continued to increase orders. He also   mentioned that capital expenditures, which had previously been on hold, were   recently approved. A packaging manufacturer reported strong demand, and a   machinery equipment industry spokesman said that orders, led by autos and   aerospace, have been rising this year from very low levels. Similarly, a custom   fabricator reported a slight increase in incoming orders and anticipated a   significant upswing in early 2011. A manufacturer of fuel pumps and dispensers   described his sales as good this year, but feared that tough economic conditions   will limit sales next year. Moreover, a plastics producer stated that, even   though October was a high-volume month, he was not expecting further   improvements until early next year. Survey contacts reported that raw materials   and finished goods prices rose at a somewhat quicker pace than in our last   report.
District retail sales generally declined in recent   weeks, although pockets of strength were reported. Several department store   managers reported disappointing sales since our last assessment and their   outlook for the holiday season was restrained. However, in the days leading up   to Black Friday, a few contacts reported an increase in foot traffic and sales.   Big-ticket sales were generally soft, with mixed reports from car and light   truck dealers. While an automobile dealer in South Carolina attributed falling   sales to the high unemployment rate in his area, a central West Virginia dealer   said that he had "a real good month." A recent boat show in Maryland drew over   90,000 visitors; sales were reported as robust and financing at low rates was   widely available. In addition, grocery sales grew more rapidly than a month ago,   according to survey contacts, and an executive at a chain hardware store in   central Virginia told us customer traffic remained steady, but the amount   customers were spending increased. Inventories flattened over the last four   weeks, according to most respondents in our November survey, and retail prices   rose moderately.
Business activity at service-providing firms   stabilized or accelerated since our last report. Most owners and managers at   restaurants across the District reported an uptick in revenues, and several   investment professionals said business had rekindled at their firms. In   Richmond, a contact at a financial services firm said his clients' appetite for   risk was returning. Even with improved client confidence, however, his firm was   not able to increase profit margins. Education and healthcare contacts noted   little change in revenues during recent weeks. "Steady, close-to-budgeted   demand" for services was the report from an executive at a North Carolina   healthcare system. A CPA in central West Virginia said the local economy   remained "pretty stagnant," but demand at his firm was steady. Prices at   services-providing firms edged up slightly, according to survey findings.
Lending activity in the District continued to   post modest gains from weak levels since our last assessment, but there were   also many areas with no improvement. Refinancing continued to dominate activity   in the mortgage market, although several bankers around the District cited   marginal improvements in new home loans. However, most loans were for homes in   the low price range and often associated with foreclosures or short sales.   Several loan officers for large regional banks reported a pickup in consumer   lending activity--mostly for home improvement or purchasing and repairing   bargain-priced homes. A banker in the Baltimore area stated that commercial loan   demand started to increase in recent weeks, noting that many loans were to   support new business, and a lender in South Carolina provided equipment   financing to several local manufacturers. Financing of new commercial   construction remained dormant, but a banker in the Baltimore area cited a modest   increase in condo and apartment construction loans. Credit quality continued to   improve, according to most bankers, even as non-performing loans and loan losses   remained above normal. However, a loan officer in the Richmond area noted that   delinquencies were moving back to normal levels.
Indicators of real estate activity around the   District were mixed during the last month. Most Realtors continued to report   limited sales activity, but several indicated that consumers have started to   shop for homes again. A Realtor in South Carolina stated that an increase in   layoffs in recent weeks contributed to slow home sales. In central Virginia, a   real estate agent reported that, while the number of contracts was down   recently, foot traffic had improved and prices had stabilized--even at the   upper-price range. A Realtor in the D.C., area described sales activity as   "pretty good" (up markedly from a year ago). However, a real estate agent in   Northern Virginia said that October was "a terrible month," although sales in   early November were showing modest improvement. Several agents noted that more   sellers in the market were opting instead to rent their properties. A Baltimore   area Realtor stated that military families moving into the area as part of   BRAC-related relocations were often renting rather than buying homes, dampening   anticipated home price increases. A contractor in North Carolina told of an   appraiser who had so much business that he was "working seven days a week with   no end in sight."
Commercial real estate activity was generally weak since our last report, but   property managers were becoming more optimistic about the near term. A Baltimore   developer described commercial property demand as spotty, but he expected a   pickup in demand from local "feds, meds, and eds." A developer of residential   complexes reported that his numbers have improved in recent weeks, but the   volume of transactions remained extremely low. A commercial Realtor in North   Carolina noted that rental rates were flat at low levels, but property owners   were able to avoid making negative cash-flow deals. In contrast, the owner of an   elevator repair service reported that businesses were spending again--partly to   maintain safety standards, but also to modernize in anticipation of a pickup in   business activity. A commercial architect said that he could now "see light at   the end of the tunnel" and was able to proceed with several projects that had   been on hold for well over a year. A contact in the D.C., area said that   architectural firms were hiring again. Nonetheless, most contractors continued   to report no speculative building, and a contractor in central Virginia said   that his region had only a few closings for new construction (mostly government   projects).
Hiring activity picked up moderately since   our last report, but employment agencies were uncertain whether the gains would   continue into December. Several sources reported increased hiring of production   and assembly workers. A supplier of ball bearings stated that his company   recently started to hire, after postponing the decision over concern about the   sustainability of improving demand. A machinery equipment industry spokesman   reported that hiring was up, but mostly limited to filling empty positions. The   tourism industry along the District's east coast added employees, according to   one contact, but mostly for temporary workers. A major retail chain store   representative said that hiring activity had been ongoing, but most likely would   be down in December when compared to a year ago. Several contacts at employment   firms reported that demand for assembly line workers was somewhat stronger than   a month ago, although the contacts were evenly split about whether the gains   would continue into December. An agency manager in South Carolina expressed   concern about a slowdown in hiring during the holiday season. Contacts continued   to report that skilled workers were hard to find, but that wage pressures were   subdued and little change was expected over the next few months.
Assessments of tourist activity were mostly   positive since our last report. A financial analyst reported that tourism in the   Baltimore area was "robust" in recent months, and a port official there noted   that Europeans were flying into Baltimore to take advantage of recently added   cruise lines. A Myrtle Beach contact characterized tourist activity as somewhat   stronger, compared to a year ago, which he attributed to increased weekend   traffic. A manager at a mountain resort in Virginia also described tourist   activity as somewhat stronger, which was due to great weather coupled with   beautiful fall foliage. That contact also mentioned that the resort had   attracted a more affluent crowd who normally spends more on food and recreation.   Restaurants did better in October and November than in the summer months, and   golf courses had more players than usual for the fall season. However, contacts   from the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Virginia Beach reported little change   in bookings in recent weeks. Several added that discretionary retail spending by   tourists was down and vacationers were looking for exceptional deals at   restaurants and recreation venues.
Dry and cool temperatures allowed Fifth   District farmers to make steady progress in harvesting and in small grain   plantings, and farm income projections increased since our last report. Corn   harvested for grain was 100 percent complete in Maryland and was winding down in   West Virginia, according to reports, with farmers in those states reportedly   pleased with yields. The corn harvest in Virginia had neared completion, with   local producers expecting low yields due to extremely dry weather. In both North   and South Carolina, the cotton harvest was ahead of schedule. In addition, small   grains had been planted and were off to a good start throughout the District.   Results of our recent agricultural credit conditions survey indicated that   income projections strengthened somewhat as a result of continued higher   commodity prices and stronger demand. However, lower yields and crop quality   were expected to have an impact on producers' financial positions.
