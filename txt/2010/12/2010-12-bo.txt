Travel and tourism in the Boston area is strong. One contact attributes the   trend to generous travel incentives and perceived value. Leisure travelers are   reported to be taking more frequent short vacations rather than fewer long   trips. The tourism outlook is seen as positive as long as the promotions   continue.
Inventory levels at most contacted firms have risen a bit since the second   quarter, either to correct undue reductions made in response to the economic   downturn or to limit future supply disruptions. One firm notes that its   inventory levels are back on plan after being low for a few quarters because of   a dramatic increase in orders. Some manufacturers say their suppliers continue   to operate at capacity and are still slow to provide necessary production   materials. These continued tight supplies along with rising oil and metals   prices have created input cost pressures for selected firms. To offset their   higher costs at least partially, these manufacturers (most of whom are   intermediate-goods suppliers) have either raised their selling prices or plan to   do so in the near future; one firm plans to raise prices from 4 percent to 6   percent, expecting that only about half of the increase will stick.   Notwithstanding these exceptions, responding manufacturers characterize selling   prices as relatively stable.
All but one of the contacted companies reports stable to increasing   employment. The number of recent or planned hires at individual firms is not   large, but they say business is good and they need more staff to handle the   increased demand. Nonetheless, employment remains well below 2008 levels at most   firms. In addition, capital expenditures currently remain in line with plans and   most firms expect little if any change in capital spending for 2011.
Responding manufacturers generally expect growth to continue at a reasonable   pace heading into 2011, although a few say they think 2011 may not be quite as   strong as 2010. Indeed, some uncertainty continues to surround the outlook for   next year. A number of firms, however, are somewhat less cautious when   discussing the prospects for next year than they have been in recent   conversations.
Around the region, investment sales activity is on the rise across most   sectors, with multifamily still the most in-demand property class and retail   second. Competition for well-leased multi-family properties in prime locations   has intensified: financing terms are increasingly favorable and capitalization   rates have fallen to as low as 5 percent in some cases. Respondents note a   number of modest construction and development projects around the region,   including retail construction and speculative (residential) land development in   Portland, a significant number of multifamily projects in Boston, and   health-care-related activity in Providence.
Boston contacts are moderately optimistic but do not expect growth to result   in substantial net absorption during the next six to 12 months. Risk of further   downward pressure on office rents in Boston's financial district continues,   reflecting both high vacancy rates and a downward shift in the cost basis among   properties recently sold at discounts. A Providence contact, while quite   optimistic in the near term, sees some vacancy risks on the horizon in two to   three years. Portland's outlook is more upbeat than in the last report, based on   talk of growing investor interest and potential leasing demand. The outlook for   Hartford remains uncertain and our contact is not willing to bet on robust   growth in the near future.
