First District retailers report mixed   sales results for the fall months. Year-over-year same-store sales range from   decreases in the low single digits to increases in the low single digits, with   several contacts reporting flat sales. The majority of contacted retailers   expect a highly promotional holiday shopping season yielding modest sales   increases. Inventory levels are mixed, but generally in line with expectations.   One respondent notes that cost pressure from reduced ocean freight capacity has   abated, while another reports increasing price pressure from rising fuel costs.   Headcounts continue to increase; these increases primarily reflect new store   openings, although some firms are staffing up for the holidays. One respondent   cites increased wage pressures. Retailers note significant cost increases for   commodities, particularly cotton, liquid sugars, and nuts. Outlooks range from   cautious to cautiously optimistic, with most contacts making less mention of   downside risks than in earlier conversations.
Travel and tourism in the Boston area is strong. One contact attributes the   trend to generous travel incentives and perceived value. Leisure travelers are   reported to be taking more frequent short vacations rather than fewer long   trips. The tourism outlook is seen as positive as long as the promotions   continue.
Nearly all contacted   manufacturing firms are relatively upbeat about their current activity levels.   Firms in the semiconductor sector continue to report particularly robust sales   growth in the third quarter, and manufacturers who sell components for   automobiles and other machinery also report relatively strong revenue growth. A   couple of manufacturers note that their sales are on pace with the very strong   results they posted in the fall of 2008, prior to the economy's deterioration.   Other firms indicate that their sales figures have weakened somewhat relative to   the first half of this year, but are still strong relative to 2009. Most   responding firms express less concern now than at the end of the summer that   sales growth has plateaued and/or could diminish.
Inventory levels at most contacted firms have risen a bit since the second   quarter, either to correct undue reductions made in response to the economic   downturn or to limit future supply disruptions. One firm notes that its   inventory levels are back on plan after being low for a few quarters because of   a dramatic increase in orders. Some manufacturers say their suppliers continue   to operate at capacity and are still slow to provide necessary production   materials. These continued tight supplies along with rising oil and metals   prices have created input cost pressures for selected firms. To offset their   higher costs at least partially, these manufacturers (most of whom are   intermediate-goods suppliers) have either raised their selling prices or plan to   do so in the near future; one firm plans to raise prices from 4 percent to 6   percent, expecting that only about half of the increase will stick.   Notwithstanding these exceptions, responding manufacturers characterize selling   prices as relatively stable.
All but one of the contacted companies reports stable to increasing   employment. The number of recent or planned hires at individual firms is not   large, but they say business is good and they need more staff to handle the   increased demand. Nonetheless, employment remains well below 2008 levels at most   firms. In addition, capital expenditures currently remain in line with plans and   most firms expect little if any change in capital spending for 2011.
Responding manufacturers generally expect growth to continue at a reasonable   pace heading into 2011, although a few say they think 2011 may not be quite as   strong as 2010. Indeed, some uncertainty continues to surround the outlook for   next year. A number of firms, however, are somewhat less cautious when   discussing the prospects for next year than they have been in recent   conversations.
New England   software and information technology contacts report that business continues to   improve, with year-over-year revenue increases ranging from mid-single digits to   over 20 percent in the most recent quarter. Increased activity has led most   respondents to continue raising their headcounts. One contact is adding   positions across the board, reporting a 10 percent increase in staff   year-to-date; another, by contrast, reports a modest reduction, with a number of   customer service and information technology positions being sent overseas.   Prices are holding steady, although most respondents report that strong   discounting pressure still exists. Capital and technology spending is relatively   unchanged, with only one contact reporting an increase in outlays. Respondents   are generally more optimistic than they were three months ago. With strong order   pipelines, most are expecting a continuation or slight acceleration of their   current rate of growth in early 2011.
A majority of New England staffing   contacts report that business continues to expand. Most contacts describe   business since the end of the third quarter as "good" or "slightly improved,"   citing revenue growth in the single-digit range, although a few have experienced   inconsistent activity in recent months. Year-over-year revenue changes range   from flat to up more than 30 percent. Labor demand has strengthened,   particularly in the information technology, medical, manufacturing, and legal   sectors. Labor supply is starting to tighten, with contacts reporting increasing   difficulty in finding qualified candidates, especially for high-skilled jobs. In   response, many contacts have strengthened their recruitment efforts and some   have expanded their sales forces. Jobs remain hard to fill from the demand side   as well: an elongated hiring cycle persists, with many clients still reluctant   to hire. Some respondents continue to express concern over rising   employment-related costs such as UI and workers' comp. Despite these concerns,   staffing contacts remain generally positive in their outlook, predicting faster   growth in 2011.
Reports indicate that New   England's commercial real estate market improved modestly in recent weeks.   Office leasing volume is up in core Boston business zones, but mostly because of   lease renewals as net absorption remains close to zero. Providence saw slow but   positive net absorption and a pickup in leasing activity in recent weeks. In   Portland, no significant absorption is reported but rents appear to have leveled   off and some significant deals for downtown office space are under discussion.   By exception, market fundamentals are flat in Hartford as business sentiment   remains cautious amid uncertainty.
Around the region, investment sales activity is on the rise across most   sectors, with multifamily still the most in-demand property class and retail   second. Competition for well-leased multi-family properties in prime locations   has intensified: financing terms are increasingly favorable and capitalization   rates have fallen to as low as 5 percent in some cases. Respondents note a   number of modest construction and development projects around the region,   including retail construction and speculative (residential) land development in   Portland, a significant number of multifamily projects in Boston, and   health-care-related activity in Providence.
Boston contacts are moderately optimistic but do not expect growth to result   in substantial net absorption during the next six to 12 months. Risk of further   downward pressure on office rents in Boston's financial district continues,   reflecting both high vacancy rates and a downward shift in the cost basis among   properties recently sold at discounts. A Providence contact, while quite   optimistic in the near term, sees some vacancy risks on the horizon in two to   three years. Portland's outlook is more upbeat than in the last report, based on   talk of growing investor interest and potential leasing demand. The outlook for   Hartford remains uncertain and our contact is not willing to bet on robust   growth in the near future.
Home and condos sales in the   First District declined again in September on a year-over-year basis. Contacts   throughout the region continue to attribute the declines to the expiration of   the tax credit, along with job insecurity and more general economic uncertainty.   Respondents expect year-over-year monthly declines for the rest of the year and   worry that 2010 sales will be lower than 2009. At the same time, the median   price of homes and condos is edging up in most parts of the region. Some   contacts say the rise in the median price is due to increased activity in   higher-end properties, not to a broad increase in home prices. Inventory   continues to climb throughout the region; most contacts see these increases as a   positive development because the number of properties for sale has been very   low. Contacts do not expect strong activity to return to the region's housing   markets until consumer confidence improves.
