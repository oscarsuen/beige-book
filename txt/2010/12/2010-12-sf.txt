Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to edge up during the   reporting period of mid-October through mid-November. Despite rising prices for   selected commodities, price increases for final goods and services remained   quite limited, and upward wage pressures were largely absent. Sales of retail   items and services rose a bit further. Manufacturing activity in the District   continued to expand on net. Sales of agricultural products were robust, and   demand strengthened for providers of energy resources. Housing demand stayed   subdued, and demand for commercial real estate remained weak but showed signs of   life in a few areas. Financial institutions reported that lending activity was   largely unchanged.
Upward wage pressures were virtually nonexistent, held down by minimal demand   for new employees and high unemployment in most parts of the District. However,   contacts continued to point to significant increases in employee benefit costs,   particularly for health care. Hiring plans for permanent employees remained   quite limited in most sectors, although a few reports pointed to expectations   for a larger surge of temporary holiday hires than in the past two years.
Demand for services firmed further. Sales expanded for providers of   technology services, prompted in part by a focus on efficiency-enhancing   software investments in most sectors of the economy. Demand for professional   services, such as legal and accounting, held largely stable. Providers of energy   services reported further demand growth from households and businesses. Travel   activity improved further in much of the District, spurred by growth in business   travel as well as tourism. Visitor volumes and hotel occupancy rates showed   solid gains in Hawaii but were flat to down in San Diego.
