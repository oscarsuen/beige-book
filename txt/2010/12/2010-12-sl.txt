A contact in south-central Kentucky reported that commercial construction is   stable, but still not at the same level as recent years. A contact in southern   Indiana noted a few industrial development projects. A contact in Louisville   reported that speculative construction remains hampered by the lack of financing   and economic uncertainties. Banking and Finance A survey of senior loan officers at a   sample of large District banks showed little change in overall lending activity   for the three-month period ending in October. Credit standards for commercial   and industrial loans remained basically unchanged, while demand was about the   same. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans were also basically   unchanged, while credit standards for residential mortgage loans and consumer   loans ranged from unchanged to tightened somewhat. Meanwhile, demand for   commercial real estate, residential mortgage, and consumer loans all varied   slightly, ranging from moderately weaker to moderately stronger. Agriculture and Natural Resources Lower-than-average   rainfalls and warmer temperatures expedited the completion of the corn, soybean,   sorghum, and cotton harvests in the Eighth District. However, dry conditions   resulted in a 41 percent to 89 percent reduction from last year in the level of   adequate and surplus topsoil moisture levels. By early November, states in the Eighth District had planted at least 13   percent more winter wheat in comparison with the average levels planted by this   time during 2005-09, and at least 70 percent of the current winter wheat crop in   the District was rated in fair or better condition.
