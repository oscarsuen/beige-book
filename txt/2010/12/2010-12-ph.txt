Most Third District business contacts foresee slow improvement ahead.   Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next six   months. Retailers expect sales for this year's holiday shopping period to exceed   sales for the same period last year. Bankers expect just slow growth in lending   in the next few months. Contacts in residential real estate expect activity to   move up slowly, at best, but contacts in commercial real estate do not   anticipate a meaningful change from current soft conditions in the near future.   Service-sector companies expect slow growth from now into next year.
Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance. Among the firms surveyed in November, about half   expect increases in new orders and shipments, and about one-fifth expect   decreases. Capital spending plans among area manufacturers have increased   somewhat in recent months, although many noted that implementation of new plant   or equipment is primarily to replace obsolete equipment, increase efficiency, or   meet pollution control requirements. Several firms said they will not expand   production facilities until they get orders they are unable to fill with their   current capacity.
Third District auto dealers reported rising sales and improved profitability   since the last Beige Book. Inventories were generally described as appropriate   for the current sales rate. Dealers expect sales to rise until the end of the   year, but some expressed concern that the sales pace might slip during the first   quarter of 2011, after the better than expected results of 2010.
According to the Third District bankers surveyed for this report, the outlook   is that there will be only slow growth in lending to both consumers and   businesses in the months ahead. Although bankers in most parts of the District   believe economic conditions are improving gradually, they do not expect a   parallel rise in loan demand. And one banker expressed concern that economic   recovery will come too slowly to reverse deteriorating financial conditions   among some local firms.
Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that there has been little change   in conditions in commercial and industrial markets since the last Beige Book.   Contacts said that vacancy rates and rents have been nearly steady, although   there have been increased reports of landlord concessions. Several contacts   reported that tenants have been taking advantage of lower effective rents,   resulting in increased leasing activity and relocations, but no increase in   leased space. Some contacts noted recent signs of growing investor interest in   apartment buildings and some Class A office buildings, but retail buildings   continued to be out of favor. The pace of commercial construction remains slow,   although there have been some recent increases in renovation and remodeling   activity. Commercial real estate contacts expect current market conditions to   persist. "Next year will be a lot like this year," one contact said. Building   owners and agents agree that a significant increase in demand for commercial and   industrial space will not take hold until employment begins to grow more   strongly.
