The price of crude oil rose moderately on stronger demand from China and a   weaker dollar. On-highway prices of both diesel and gasoline increased. Natural   gas prices remained weak as mild weather, record-high inventories and forecasts   for a normal winter put downward pressure on prices. Solid demand, tight   supplies, and multiple plant outages led ethylene producers to push through a 4   cent increase in contract prices for October, and spot prices rose sharply in   response.
Most high-tech manufacturers said growth in orders and production continued   at a much slower pace than in the first half of the year. Sales of some consumer   products such as personal computers and laptops slowed, but demand for gaming   products and smart phones remained strong. Several respondents expressed concern   about reduced demand from the public sector as governments at all levels were   faced with large revenue shortfalls. Still, most respondents expected conditions   to remain stable for the next three months.
Demand for paper products held steady. Food manufactures said growth in   orders was stable over the reporting period, and the three-month outlook for   sales was positive. Trailer manufacturers reported a slowdown in demand.   Contacts in aircraft parts distribution and manufacturing saw an increase in   demand due to higher utilization of aircraft fleets and deferred maintenance   work.
Refiners said conditions remained weak. Demand for oil products continued to   decline and refiner margins were being squeezed by the rise in oil prices.   Refinery utilization rates stood just above 80 percent, down from 90 percent   this summer.
Automobile sales were slightly weaker over the reporting period, by more than   normal seasonality would suggest. Inventories rose, but remain at healthy   levels, according to contacts. A typical slowdown in sales is expected heading   into the holiday season, but the outlook for next year is cautiously optimistic,   with most contacts predicting modest growth in sales.
Accounting firms said some increase in consulting and merger and acquisition   work has kept demand stable. Uncertainty regarding impending tax legislation   continued to constrain demand for transactional services, but contacts were   generally optimistic about year-end earnings. Demand for legal services remained   soft. The only area of increased activity is mergers and acquisitions. Legal   firms say they are in a better position than last year, but remain cautious in   their outlooks.
Transportation services demand was positive. Intermodal transportation firms   noted a wide-spread increase in cargo volumes was buoyed by demand from   international clients. Railroad contacts said continued solid gains in volumes   boosted revenues. International container trade volumes rose slightly during the   past four weeks, and contacts expect a modest pickup in container traffic next   year. Firms that ship small parcel goods said growth in volumes flattened during   the reporting period, but remained above year-ago levels. Airline traffic was   steady over the past six weeks. Contacts noted that conditions are much better   than a year ago, and the outlook is for modest growth in the near term.
Apartment demand continued to rise steadily during the reporting period, and   occupancies edged up. Rents are moving up, according to contacts. Construction   activity remains low by historical standards, but it has picked up slightly in   recent weeks. Investment activity for multifamily properties has risen since the   last report.
Office leasing continues to edge up, which is "giving people a little more   confidence," according to contacts. Respondents in the industrial sector also   noted increased lease deals, but said rents are near historic lows. Excess space   and tight credit conditions have limited nonresidential construction. Investment   activity remains subdued, but contacts say recent signs of economic improvement   should enable more risk-taking in the near term.
