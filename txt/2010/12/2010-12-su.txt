Economic activity in the Boston, Cleveland,   Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts increased at a slight to modest   pace, while a somewhat stronger pace of economic activity was seen in New York,   Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Philadelphia and St. Louis   reported business conditions as mixed.
Manufacturing activity continued to expand in almost all Districts, with   relatively strong growth seen in metal fabrication and the automotive   industries. Reports also showed steady to increasing activity for professional   and nonfinancial services. Two Districts noted a decline in demand from   government agencies due to budgetary shortfalls. Reports on consumer spending   tended to be positive. Nonetheless, several Districts noted that households   remain price sensitive and focused on buying necessities. Expectations for the   holiday shopping season were generally positive, with several Districts   expecting higher sales when compared to year-ago levels. Sales of new cars and   light trucks were largely higher than in our last report. Tourism improved in   all reporting Districts.
Housing markets remain depressed, with several Districts reporting further   weakening during the past six weeks. Conditions in commercial real estate were   mixed, and activity stayed at low levels. Agricultural conditions were generally   favorable, with several Districts reporting yields nearing historic highs.   Agricultural sales to off-shore buyers increased. Overall activity in the energy   sector continued to expand.
Lending activity remained stable across most Districts. Credit quality has   been steady to improving for most of the Districts that commented on it. Prices   for final goods and services were fairly stable, despite rising input costs,   especially for agricultural commodities, metals, and fuel. Hiring activity   showed some improvement across most Districts. Wage pressures were   contained.
Sales of new automobiles and light trucks rose in nine Districts during the   reporting period, with several Districts indicating that vehicle inventories are   now at appropriate levels.

Tourism was characterized as stronger or improved in the Boston, New York,   Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, while   business travel to destinations in the New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco   Districts increased. Occupancy rates at hotels in Manhattan and Atlanta's major   markets were higher than a year ago. The Richmond and Atlanta Districts noted a   pickup in international visitors. In Boston, increased tourism was attributed to   generous travel incentives and perceived value, while Richmond noted that   discretionary retail spending by tourists was lower.
Conditions in the commercial real estate industry were mixed during the   reporting period. Several Districts reported flat demand and high vacancy rates,   which translated into limited nonresidential construction activity. The New   York, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts noted some weakening in nonresidential   activity, while the Boston and Dallas Districts indicated some modest   improvement in commercial real estate. Reports from Cleveland and Chicago noted   that most new projects fell generally into the infrastructure category. Contacts   in Boston, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas expressed some optimism about the   near-term outlook in their Districts, but contacts in several other Districts   expressed a more cautious outlook.
Activity in the energy sector was expanding. The number of active drilling   rigs increased in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Although   producers are interested in returning to the Gulf of Mexico, drilling remains   well below pre-oil spill levels as permit issuance lags. Producers in Kansas   City expressed concern about future production due to labor and equipment   shortages. Cleveland reported an increase in production from Marcellus shale. In   the Minneapolis District, wind energy continued to expand, but at a slower pace   than a year ago, while mining activity increased.
Prices of final goods and services were fairly stable across Districts   despite rising input costs, especially for agricultural commodities, metals, and   fuel. Companies in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco   Districts reported a limited ability to pass through higher input costs to   customers given the relative softness in demand. However, some manufacturers in   the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta Districts have announced plans to raise their   product prices in the near future. Retailers in Philadelphia and San Francisco   noted price increases on selected products imported from Asian countries.   Reports from the Chicago and Dallas Districts indicated that that record-high   inventories and forecasts for a warmer-than-normal winter are putting downward   pressure on natural gas prices.
