Tourism activity in New York City has been strong since the last report.   Manhattan hotels report that occupancy rates continued to hover around 90   percent in October and remained higher than a year ago in November; room rates   continued to edge up since the last report and were running 7 to 8 percent ahead   of a year ago. While leisure visits to New York City are described as steady and   robust, business travel has strengthened steadily. Broadway theaters report a   pickup in both attendance and total revenues in late October and early November:   after a dip in September and early October, business is, once again, running   ahead of a year earlier.
Consumer confidence, though still at low levels, has improved modestly since   the last report. The Conference Board reports that consumer confidence among   residents of the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, PA) rose in September and   October, reversing a decline in August. Similarly, Siena College's latest survey   of New York State residents shows confidence rising to its highest level since   May both upstate and in the New York City area.
Activity in New York City's co-op and condo market has slipped by a bit more   than the seasonal norm in October and early November, particularly at the lower   end of the market, though a recent flurry of activity is reported at the very   high end (homes in the range of $8 million or more). Prices remain stable across   the spectrum. While the number of new condos under construction has declined   modestly, there continues to be a substantial inventory of unsold, completed   units. Manhattan's rental market has reportedly softened a bit since the last   report. Rents remain stable, but landlords are, once again, offering concessions   (such as one or more month's free rent), though these discounts are not as steep   as in 2009. A substantial amount of new housing in the pipeline is likely to be   offered as rentals.
Office markets across the District have been steady to slightly softer thus   far in the fourth quarter. Asking rents held steady in Manhattan and slipped in   northern New Jersey, Long Island and Rochester but rose modestly in Westchester   and Fairfield counties and in Buffalo. Vacancy rates have been steady to   modestly higher since the last report. Sales of commercial properties remain   sluggish, and a contact in upstate New York reports that commercial construction   activity remains at depressed levels.
On the other hand, manufacturing activity has weakened, on balance, as a   number of firms saw slower activity and fewer contacts reported improvements.   Yet these contacts continue to report that they are increasing employment, on   balance, and they are increasingly optimistic about the near-term outlook. Also,   manufacturing contacts indicate that they are currently holding somewhat higher   cash balances than usual, and a sizable proportion of contacts indicate that   they plan to increase cash holdings over the next year. Both manufacturers and   other firms report moderate increases in prices paid but little or no change in   their selling prices.
