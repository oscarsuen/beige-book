Economic activity in the Seventh District increased at a slightly faster pace   this reporting period. Retail and manufacturing contacts were more optimistic   about the outlook for the rest of the year and early 2011, while construction   and financial contacts remained cautious in their assessment. Consumer spending   rose moderately, and business spending continued to increase at a steady pace.   Manufacturing production also increased, while construction was limited outside   of highway and bridge work. Credit conditions were slightly improved. Cost   pressures rose, but there was limited pass-through to downstream prices. Wage   pressures remained moderate. Consumer Spending Consumer spending was up moderately   from the previous reporting period. Retail sales excluding autos increased in   October and early November. Consumers continued to spend mostly on essentials,   but contacts noted that discretionary and impulse spending were returning   slowly. The best selling items again were those most heavily promoted and   discounted like apparel, electronics, appliances, and home improvement goods.   Retailers also noted greater optimism for the holiday shopping season, with   several reporting that they recently had made later-than-usual orders of   big-ticket items in anticipation of Black Friday. Auto sales also rose, aided by   increased incentives. Auto dealers indicated that inventory had returned to more   comfortable levels, although a few again cited a limited supply of stronger   selling models. Business Spending Business spending continued to increase   at a steady pace from the previous reporting period. Capital spending on   equipment and structures was little changed. Inventory rebuilding in   manufacturing leveled off. However, heavy machinery rental fleets continued to   expand, and higher-than-expected fall sales prompted retailers to expand   inventories in advance of the holiday shopping season. Hiring was again mostly   limited to manufacturers bringing on temporary workers. In contrast, a few   manufacturing contacts also reported contemplating increasing the number of work   shifts, a decision which would require hiring additional permanent employees. In   addition, a staffing firm reported a modest increase in industrial   temporary-to-permanent transitions. Outside of manufacturing, hiring in   information technology, engineering, and healthcare remained strong; seasonal   hiring in retail trade was greater than the prior year; and there was a small   increase in demand for temporary office and clerical workers. Construction and Real Estate Construction activity was   limited in October and early November. Elevated levels of unsold homes continued   to be a drag on new residential construction and home prices. Home builders   reported only a modest improvement in sales, with showroom traffic weak but   conversion rates increasing. The availability of mortgage financing,   particularly for condominiums, remained a constraint for homebuyers, although   lower mortgage rates led to an increase in refinancing. Residential development   of new properties was minimal, as builders were instead concentrating their work   on existing distressed properties. Private nonresidential construction was again   subdued, although contacts reported a small increase in industrial projects.   Public construction, driven by highway and bridge work, remained strong. Manufacturing Manufacturing production continued to   improve through October and early November. Contacts generally expressed a very   positive outlook for manufacturing, pointing to recent indications of demand   firming into early 2011. The fabricated metals, automotive, and heavy equipment   sectors were again strong sources of growth in manufacturing. Steel production   softened recently, but contacts noted that service center inventories remain   lean and that order inquiries for January delivery had accelerated in recent   weeks. Orders were also reported to be on the rise for metal fabricators in the   automotive, oil and gas, and aerospace industries. Contacts in the automotive   industry were relatively upbeat, expecting auto sales to continue to strengthen   into 2011 with the retail segment gaining momentum. Freight tonnage and new   orders for heavy trucks increased, with strong demand expected next year to   replace an aging fleet. Heavy equipment manufacturers reported continued   strength in the demand for earth-moving equipment abroad and a recent increase   in domestic activity. In contrast, activity was mixed for manufacturers with   ties to residential housing. Shipments of construction materials decreased,   while shipments of appliances increased in advance of Black Friday   promotions. Banking and Finance Credit conditions improved from the   previous reporting period. Fierce competition for high-quality borrowers was   indicated to be leading to aggressive terms and structures for business credit,   although core business loan demand remained weak. In contrast, banking contacts   reported an increase in demand for refinancing, merger and acquisition lending,   and in agribusiness for working capital. Commercial real estate credit   conditions were slightly improved, with CMBS issuance increasing and bank   lending for distressed property investment edging up. Consumer lending also   picked up a little in October and early November, although contacts worried that   the weak labor market and potential end of extended unemployment insurance   benefits would limit consumer spending in the coming months. Loan quality   improved, increasing bank earnings, but contacts anticipated only modest asset   growth in 2011 as business and household deleveraging was expected to   continue. Prices and Costs Cost pressures increased from the   previous reporting period, but limited pricing power continued to constrain   pass-through to downstream prices. Manufacturing contacts cited increases in   industrial metals prices like copper, iron ore, and scrap steel; and mill lead   times were also said to be rising. Energy prices were mixed. Oil prices moved   up, but natural gas prices held at low levels with record storage and a forecast   for a warmer-than-normal winter. Retailers also reported wholesale price   increases, but most were accepting lower profit margins rather than attempting   to pass them along to consumers. Wage pressures again increased only   modestly. Agriculture Farm earnings were boosted by an early and   large harvest. The District harvest should be the third largest ever for corn   and the second largest for soybeans. Soybean yields set a record for the   District. Corn yields were less than expected in Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa,   but above average in Michigan and Wisconsin. This year's corn crop was of a   higher quality. The new corn has been blended with last year's poor quality   crop; grain elevators have been able to sell the blended crop, clearing out   storage space. In addition, the low moisture content of harvested corn plus low   natural gas prices have kept drying costs to a minimum. Dry weather allowed more   time for field work compared with a year ago, and there were reports of   shortages of fertilizer and equipment parts due to earlier-than-usual   preparations for next year's crop. Prices for corn, soybeans, milk, hogs, and   cattle were all above the levels of a year ago, particularly so for corn. Even   with higher feed costs, margins for livestock producers remained positive.
