Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that while   economic activity remains at a low level, conditions have improved modestly   further, and those improvements are broader geographically than in the last   report. Ten Districts reported some increased activity or improvement in   conditions, while the remaining two--Philadelphia and Richmond--reported mixed   conditions. The last Beige Book reported eight Districts with increased activity   or improving conditions and four Districts showing little change and/or mixed   conditions.
Most Districts reported that consumer spending in the recent 2009 holiday   season was slightly greater than in 2008, but still far below 2007 levels.   Retail inventory levels remain very lean in nearly all Districts. Auto sales   held steady or increased slightly since the last Beige Book in most Districts.   Reports on tourism were mostly flat or weak, but for two Districts whose ski   resorts enjoyed early season snowstorms. Nonfinancial services activity   generally improved in Districts that reported on this sector. Of five Districts   reporting transportation services, volumes were slightly up or mixed.   Manufacturing activity has increased or held steady since the last report in   most Districts. Among Districts reporting on near-term expectations, the   manufacturing outlook was optimistic, but spending plans remain cautious.
Toward the end of 2009, home sales increased in most Districts, especially   for lower-priced homes. Home prices appeared to have changed little since the   last Beige Book, and residential construction remained at low levels in most   Districts. Commercial real estate was still weak in nearly all Districts with   rising vacancy rates and falling rents. Since the last report, loan demand   continued to decline or remained weak in most Districts, while credit quality   continued to deteriorate. Cold weather at the end of the year adversely affected   some late crops and stressed livestock, but above-average yields for early crops   were reported by some Districts. Energy-related production has risen moderately   since the last Beige Book.
Although some hiring was reported in a few Federal Reserve Districts, labor   market conditions remained generally weak with modest wage increases appearing   in just a few Districts. Price pressures remained subdued in nearly all   Districts, though increases in metals prices were reported and agricultural   prices have been mixed.
Consumer spending in the   recent 2009 holiday season was modestly greater than in 2008 for eight   Districts, although as retailers in the Philadelphia and San Francisco Districts   noted, 2008 sales were so low compared with 2007, that the relatively small 2009   gains did not represent a significant shift in trend. Consumers were variously   described as cautious, price sensitive, and focused on necessities, but   sometimes willing to spend on discretionary purchases. Kansas City and New York   reported holiday sales comparable to prior year sales, while Cleveland and   Richmond reported weaker holiday sales in 2009 than in 2008. Entering the   holiday period, retail inventories were maintained or lowered further to lean   levels in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York Districts. Some   Chicago retailers reported running out of high-demand items during the holiday   season, but inventory levels rose slightly in the Kansas City District.
Auto sales were flat or up slightly for some dealers since the last Beige   Book in the Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, and Philadelphia Districts. Dealer   incentives boosted year-end inventory clearance according to Chicago District   contacts. In the Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, and San Francisco Districts auto   sales held steady or were mixed across states. The Kansas City and Richmond   Districts reported lower auto sales since the last report. Some dealers in the   Cleveland and New York Districts cited difficulties securing floor-plan   financing. Difficulties securing customer financing was a concern cited by some   Kansas City District dealers, while Philadelphia District dealers credited   easier financing for supporting their recent sales.
Early-season snowstorms gave ski resorts a big lift in the Richmond and   Minneapolis Districts; otherwise travel and tourism reports were mostly flat or   weak in these and other Districts. One Minnesota-based travel services firm shut   down due to lack of demand, and Richmond's tourism contacts reported consumers   searching for deeply discounted packages and dining out less despite special   offers. The New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts also reported flat or   weaker tourism. New York City's Broadway theaters reported weaker attendance   this past holiday season than in 2008. Atlanta reported sluggish tourism   throughout their District, but expected a boost from hosting upcoming National   Football League events, and from strong 2010 cruise line bookings--a result of   deep discounting. Kansas City and San Francisco noted sluggish business travel,   placing downward pressure on airline passenger volumes, while Dallas reported   airline demand recovering and fares stabilizing. The San Francisco District   reported greater visitor volumes in Hawaii and Las Vegas, while occupancy rates   in Seattle and Southern California were down.
Districts reporting on nonfinancial   services generally indicated an upward trend in activity, although in some areas   reports were mixed. Boston reported widespread positive activity in advertising,   consulting, private equity firms, healthcare, biotechnology, education, and   government services. High-tech service firms reported favorable conditions in   Kansas City. New York reported a general pickup in activity. Health care   providers reported increased demand in the San Francisco District, while   professional services, especially advertising and accounting weakened. The   Minneapolis District also reported mixed results across sectors, while activity   in the Richmond District was generally down. Hiring through staffing firms was   reported up in New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas with office and health   care workers in greatest demand. Direct firm hiring was reported up in the St.   Louis District, flat in Dallas, flat to down in New York, and down in   Richmond.
Among the five Districts reporting on transportation services, activity was   mostly up slightly, or mixed. Freight shipping volumes were up slightly in the   Atlanta, Cleveland, and Dallas Districts, while Kansas City reported a slight   slowdown in activity. The Richmond District's port activity gained from   increased international trade, especially imports of high-end vehicles, but   intermodal firms in the Dallas District reported that imports dropped and   exports flattened producing no increase in cargo volumes. Dallas also reported   continued declines in rail cargo volume.
Manufacturing activity has improved since   the last report in six Districts. New York reported a general pickup in   activity, broad optimism, and some increase in employment. Production was stable   or slightly up in the Cleveland District. Firms in the Cleveland District expect   greater export opportunities going forward, but steel firms expect slow growth   in overall demand. Manufacturers in the Chicago District cited gains at firms   tied to the auto industry and those benefiting from an increase in exports to   Asia. Firms in the Boston District also cited Asian exports as well as defense   work as sources of their positive demand, but identified weak demand for exports   to Europe and for products related to energy sectors and commercial   construction. San Francisco reported a modest net improvement in manufacturing   activity, with semiconductors strengthening and aircraft and parts stabilizing   at moderate levels. Metal fabricators and housing products have also stabilized,   but at very low levels.
Three Districts reported mixed results for manufacturing. Food products,   furniture, and chemical firms reported slight increases in the Philadelphia   District while other manufacturing sectors continued to decline. Dallas reported   strength in high-tech and corrugated packaging, seasonal increases in food   producers, little change in fabricated metals and petrochemicals, seasonal   decreases in aircraft components, and weaknesses in emergency vehicles and   construction-related manufacturing. The Minneapolis District reported   manufacturing activity up in Minnesota, but down in the Dakotas based on a   recent survey of new orders.
Manufacturing activity was weak in the other Districts. Richmond reported   widespread weakness across shipments, new orders, and employment within its   manufacturing sector and Atlanta saw orders and production drop back after an   increase in November. The St. Louis District reported a continued decline in   activity, persistent weakness in employment, and plant closings, on net.
Manufacturers' expectations for the near future as reported from the Boston,   Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, and Philadelphia Districts were all   optimistic, although Kansas City firms were less optimistic than the last   report. Capital spending plans remained more cautious. Only Boston and   Philadelphia reported that firms were planning to increase capital spending in   the current year. Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City reported expectations of   continued modest spending.
Homes sales increased toward   the end of 2009 in most Federal Reserve Districts, except San Francisco, where   demand for housing has been steady, and Kansas City, where residential real   estate activity has eased since the last Beige Book. In New York, Richmond, and   Atlanta, residential real estate activity was described as mixed across areas of   the District. In the Atlanta District, existing home sales increased, but new   home sales decreased. In all Districts, sales of lower-priced homes tended to   increase proportionately more than sales of higher-priced homes, due at least in   part to the first-time buyer federal tax credit, according to real estate   contacts. In several Districts real estate contacts reported that the original   expiration date for the credit boosted sales in November and led to a more than   usual slowdown in sales in December. However, some contacts noted that the   extension of the credit into 2010 could give an added impetus to the expected   seasonal sales upturn this spring. Residential construction activity remained at   low levels in most Districts, although home building was reported to have   increased in the Chicago and Minneapolis Districts. Home prices appeared to have   changed little since the last Beige Book, overall. Boston, Philadelphia, and   Cleveland reported declines in home prices since the last Beige Book. Richmond   reported nearly steady prices. Dallas reported some firming in prices.
Nonresidential real estate conditions remained soft in nearly all Districts.   New York, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported further   weakening in demand for commercial and industrial space. Boston received mixed   reports on sales and leasing activity from commercial real estate contacts in   the District, and Minneapolis reported some increases in sales of commercial   buildings. Richmond reported that sales of nonresidential properties remained   slow, but that leasing of office and retail space has picked up. Vacancy rates   were rising and rents were declining in most Districts. Several Districts   reported that landlords were focused on tenant retention and that slack demand   was allowing tenants to negotiate lease extensions at low rents and with   favorable allowances. San Francisco reported that lower rents appeared to be   supporting an upturn in leasing in some parts of that District, although vacancy   rates continued to rise. Nonresidential construction activity was generally weak   in all Districts, although St. Louis reported some gains in construction of   education facilities and Cleveland reported a recent increase in nonresidential   contracting.
Loan demand continued to decline or   remained weak in most Districts. St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San   Francisco noted general declines or soft loan demand. New York reported   declining demand for all types of loans except residential mortgages for which   demand has been steady. Philadelphia reported continuing declines for all   categories of credit. Cleveland noted declining demand for business loans and   underutilization of commercial credit lines. Richmond reported that commercial   and industrial loan demand was steady to slightly up since the last Beige Book   but still down year-to-year. Chicago noted low utilization of commercial credit   lines but an uptick in financing of mergers and acquisitions. Other recent   increases were reported for mortgage refinancing in the Atlanta District and   auto loans in the Chicago District. San Francisco noted a small improvement in   venture capital financing and initial public offerings.
A number of Districts reported that credit quality continued to deteriorate.   Financial institutions in the New York District reported ongoing increases in   delinquencies for all types of loans. Banks in the Philadelphia District   reported that delinquencies and defaults continued to rise for all types of   loans, although less sharply than at the time of the previous Beige Book.   Cleveland received reports of steady consumer credit quality but high and rising   commercial loan delinquencies. Kansas City noted year-over-year declines in   credit quality among financial institutions in the District, and Dallas and San   Francisco reported continued deterioration at financial institutions in their   Districts.
Federal Reserve   District Banks reporting on agricultural conditions generally indicated that   cold weather at the turn of the year had adversely affected crops and stressed   livestock. Atlanta noted damage to citrus crops from the cold, and Chicago and   Minneapolis reported that winter storms halted corn harvesting, and impeded   tillage and fertilizer application. However, Dallas reported that rain improved   soil conditions after a dry period in that District. Corn and soybean crop   yields before the onset of cold weather and storms were described as above   average in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts. Kansas City also reported that   the winter wheat crop was progressing normally. San Francisco reported an   increase in sales of agricultural products, with a boost from a rise in demand   from foreign countries. Agricultural prices have been mixed. Grain and soybean   prices were mostly on the rise, according to reports from Chicago and Kansas   City. Chicago also reported increased prices for milk and hogs, but a decline in   cattle prices.
Production of energy-related materials has risen moderately since the last   Beige Book. Atlanta reported that oil production has continued to increase.   Minneapolis reported an increase in oil and gas exploration, and Kansas City and   Dallas reported increases in drilling. San Francisco noted an increase in   extraction of natural gas but a continued low rate of oil extraction. In   contrast to generally rising oil and gas production, coal production was   reported to have declined by Cleveland and St. Louis, and falling iron mining   activity was reported by Minneapolis.
Labor market conditions   remained soft in most Federal Reserve Districts, although New York reported a   modest pickup in hiring and St. Louis reported that several service-sector firms   in that District recently announced plans to hire new workers. In the Richmond   District, temporary employment agencies gave mixed reports, but some noted   increased demand for administrative and sales workers, laborers, and warehousing   and distribution workers. Wage pressures remained subdued in most Federal   Reserve Districts, and Atlanta noted continued wage freezes at some employers in   that District. However, Boston reported some modest pay increases, and   Minneapolis indicated that wages in that District have been level or rising   moderately.
Price pressures remained subdued in nearly all Federal Reserve Districts,   although increases in metals prices were noted in Boston, Cleveland,   Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco. Raw materials prices, other than metals,   were reported to be mostly steady, although firms in the New York, Philadelphia,   and Chicago Districts noted some increases in the cost of the inputs they use.   Agricultural commodity prices were reported on the increase by Chicago, Kansas   City, and Dallas. Most Districts reported that retail prices have been   steady.
