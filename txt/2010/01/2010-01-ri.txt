Economic reports across the Fifth District varied in our latest assessment,   with a few major sectors reporting moderate contractions over the last month. On   the downside, both retail and services firms reported declining revenues,   continuing a pattern that had been in place for some time. Manufacturing   activity, which had been edging higher since spring, turned down in December,   although furniture and textile makers reported an uptick in demand. On the more   positive side, both import and export activity at District ports improved, and   banking activity received a modest boost, particularly from increased lending   for equipment. Conditions in the real estate sector were little changed from our   last report, but some encouraging signs were noted in office and retail leasing.   Finally, both tourism and temporary employment services reported mixed results   for activity over the past month; temporary employment, however, is expected to   improve over the near term. Retail Revenues generally declined at retail businesses   in recent weeks, although a few contacts reported some improvement in sales.   Managers at most department stores said sales fell; several grocery store   managers also reported a drop in sales even as customer traffic increased.   Big-ticket sales languished, notably at automobile dealerships. However, an   executive at a hardware chain in central Virginia reported that revenues and   customer traffic were up slightly, which he attributed, in part, to "a little   movement" in the local housing market. A contact representing several retail   establishments also reported revenue growth at small and mid-sized stores   despite early discounts, and a manager at a large North Carolina bookstore said   customer traffic was "hopping." A severe snowstorm the weekend before Christmas   had a mixed effect on holiday sales, with reports of sales activity ranging from   "through the roof" to dramatic declines. However, retail job cuts were more   widespread since our last report; retail wages were flat, and prices moved up   further. Services Revenues at most services firms declined since   our last report, but contacts at financial services establishments reported a   bit of strengthening in mid-December. Managers at hotels and restaurants   reported slower business and specialty contractors continued to experience   declining revenues, while demand for services was unchanged at most   business-to-business services providers. However, several contacts at financial   services firms reported an uptick in revenues--one manager described the mood by   saying there was a little more optimism about the markets, but his clients were   not optimistic about the economy yet. He quipped, "The economy is still in   intensive care." Employment and wages edged down slightly at services firms;   prices were unchanged since our last report. Manufacturing District manufacturing slipped in late   November and December, although there were some signs of cautious optimism.   Contacts reported widespread weakness across shipments, new orders and   employment. A window manufacturer said that his business was closing three   warehouses and one manufacturing plant in order to align his company to the   continued weak economy. A producer of machinery noted that he had experienced   the worst month in over a decade and indicated that, if he did not see some   improvement after the first of the year, he was not sure how long his company   would survive. A textile manufacturer said that, "We have turned the corner,"   but added that the biggest issue was getting credit for his customers. A   furniture manufacturer noted that residential furniture sales had improved   somewhat, although commercial sales remained very soft. A producer of electrical   components indicated that export business carried his firm during weak domestic   demand. Contacts reported that raw materials prices increased at a slower pace   and finished goods prices changed little from a month ago. Port authorities in the District reported moderate but widespread gains in   export and import activity in November and early December, compared to earlier   months this year. Several port officials reported both an increase in the number   of vessels and the amount of cargo being carried per vessel since the start of   the fourth quarter. Shipping lines, according to one official, have adapted   "super slow" shipping policies (running ships at slower speeds to conserve   fuel), because capacity is abundant and fuel costs are high. High-end vehicles   led import gains. Other types of heavy cargo, as well as container goods, also   crept up from third-quarter levels. Finance Loan demand was generally described as either   unchanged or slightly higher since our last report, with modest gains noted   particularly for equipment spending. While consumer and mortgage loan demand was   weak, commercial demand increased in some areas of the District. Several bankers   cited examples of small businesses replacing and in some cases expanding their   purchase of new equipment; in many instances the borrowers were aided by Small   Business Administration programs that guaranteed a portion of the loan. One   banker reported that increased spending on public infrastructure contributed to   a major purchase of heavy equipment by a construction firm. Nonetheless, most   bankers reaffirmed that small businesses were still experiencing a large number   of loan rejections due to tight credit standards and weak earnings. Indeed,   lending activity remained well below year-ago levels, and several bankers in   less urban areas of the District stated that demand was weak, continuing the   trend of the last several months. Real Estate Residential real estate agents gave mixed   signals on house sales activity in the Fifth District. The Fredericksburg   housing market had steady sales and a local agent noted that the tax credit   program was "keeping people in the game." However, in Richmond, a contact   reported that while buyers continued to look, few had shown urgencies in making   offers. Several respondents expressed concern for their markets once the federal   tax credit program ends and interest rates start to rise. One contact noted that   some banks anticipated a large number of spring foreclosures and were accepting   lower prices on the real estate they owned. House prices remained generally   steady across much of the District. However, weak consumer confidence remained a   constraint. Contacts across the District reported that houses priced in the   low-to-middle range remained their best sellers, while sales in the higher price   range were rare. While the sales side of commercial real estate markets remained anemic,   agents in the District reported an uptick in office and retail leasing activity   over the last two months. Several agents noted that landlords were lowering   their leasing rates in exchange for an extension of the length of the lease. In   addition, one agent stated that more businesses were making decisions to either   expand or upgrade their current facilities. One agent noted that national retail   chains, attracted to the relatively low unemployment rates across the District,   were actively seeking new sites in anticipation of an expansion in retail   spending when the economy improved. In most cases, demand for retail space was   also being driven by bargain hunters trying to take advantage of low rental   rates. However, one agent noted that retail space in small strip malls was still   suffering from high vacancy rates, while downtown retail space was generally in   "good shape." Finally, government agencies were identified by one agent as a key   source of leasing demand and, in some cases, were the motivation behind new   office construction in the area. Tourism Assessments of tourist activity varied since our   last report. Contacts along the coast generally reported that bookings were   somewhat weaker, which they attributed to people's lack of confidence in the   economy. An hotelier at Virginia Beach and an analyst on the Outer Banks of   North Carolina said that tourists were looking for deeply discounted packages.   In addition, holiday party bookings were practically nonexistent because groups   were having their office Christmas parties on-site. Tourism contacts in Virginia   and in the Carolinas characterized consumer spending habits as somewhat weaker   than a year ago. They noted that consumers were eating out less than ever   before, despite the "specials" offered at area restaurants. On a brighter note,   respondents at ski resorts reported an historically high number of bookings,   which they credited to significant snow accumulation from a major snowstorm that   struck the Atlantic Coast on the last weekend before Christmas. A manager at a   ski resort in Virginia said that visits were up 40 percent--the highest number   of visits in the last 20 years. Temporary Employment Temporary employment agents gave   mixed reports on recent demand for workers across the District, but were upbeat   about future demand. Several agents in Raleigh reported generally improving   demand and expected even more strengthening in the coming months. One agent   reported that many of his customers were both filling vacant positions and   expanding hiring. Another agent noted that several manufacturing companies were   hiring contract workers. However, other manufacturing clients were very   apprehensive about hiring due to concerns over the underlying strength of their   order books. In addition, several agents reported weak demand over the past six   weeks, but expected stronger demand over the next six months. A Hagerstown agent   expected stronger demand for workers due to a slight improvement in the overall   economy. Likewise, a Richmond agent was optimistic about stronger demand for   workers at her agency in the near future, due also to some signs, albeit slight,   of economic recovery as well as actual improvements in selected divisions of the   agency. In general, among the most available positions were in warehouse and   distribution centers, general and day labor, and administrative, sales, and   quality assurance.
