Economic reports across the Fifth District varied in our latest assessment,   with a few major sectors reporting moderate contractions over the last month. On   the downside, both retail and services firms reported declining revenues,   continuing a pattern that had been in place for some time. Manufacturing   activity, which had been edging higher since spring, turned down in December,   although furniture and textile makers reported an uptick in demand. On the more   positive side, both import and export activity at District ports improved, and   banking activity received a modest boost, particularly from increased lending   for equipment. Conditions in the real estate sector were little changed from our   last report, but some encouraging signs were noted in office and retail leasing.   Finally, both tourism and temporary employment services reported mixed results   for activity over the past month; temporary employment, however, is expected to   improve over the near term.
Port authorities in the District reported moderate but widespread gains in   export and import activity in November and early December, compared to earlier   months this year. Several port officials reported both an increase in the number   of vessels and the amount of cargo being carried per vessel since the start of   the fourth quarter. Shipping lines, according to one official, have adapted   "super slow" shipping policies (running ships at slower speeds to conserve   fuel), because capacity is abundant and fuel costs are high. High-end vehicles   led import gains. Other types of heavy cargo, as well as container goods, also   crept up from third-quarter levels.
While the sales side of commercial real estate markets remained anemic,   agents in the District reported an uptick in office and retail leasing activity   over the last two months. Several agents noted that landlords were lowering   their leasing rates in exchange for an extension of the length of the lease. In   addition, one agent stated that more businesses were making decisions to either   expand or upgrade their current facilities. One agent noted that national retail   chains, attracted to the relatively low unemployment rates across the District,   were actively seeking new sites in anticipation of an expansion in retail   spending when the economy improved. In most cases, demand for retail space was   also being driven by bargain hunters trying to take advantage of low rental   rates. However, one agent noted that retail space in small strip malls was still   suffering from high vacancy rates, while downtown retail space was generally in   "good shape." Finally, government agencies were identified by one agent as a key   source of leasing demand and, in some cases, were the motivation behind new   office construction in the area.
