Overall economic activity in the Ninth District grew tepidly since the last   report. Consumer spending, tourism, energy, mining and residential construction   and real estate saw modest increases. Manufacturing and services were mixed,   while commercial construction was stable. Decreases in activity occurred in   agriculture. Labor markets remained weak, but the pace of job losses has slowed.   Meanwhile, wage increases were modest, and overall prices remained flat.
A Minnesota auto dealer noted that November and December sales were up from a   year ago. Meanwhile, a representative of an auto dealers association in North   Dakota reported that recent vehicle sales were generally soft.
Winter tourism activity was up from a year ago. Tourism activity increased in   northwestern Wisconsin due to excellent snow conditions for snowmobiling and   skiing. In western South Dakota, winter sports have also benefited from a deep   snow cover; a local tourism official noted strong numbers of vehicles with   snowmobile trailers and ski racks. A Minnesota ski resort reported that activity   picked up during the holidays; advanced bookings were about on par with a year   ago.
Wages generally remained level or rose modestly, and this trend may continue.   For example, wages for most employees at the University of Montana will be   frozen for the next two years. Of the respondents to the aforementioned St.   Cloud survey, 19 percent plan to increase wages and benefits over the next six   months, while 6 percent plan decreases.
Prices generally remained flat since the last report. For example, recent   Minnesota gasoline and fertilizer prices are about level with mid-November.   However, natural gas and some metal component prices have increased since the   last report.
