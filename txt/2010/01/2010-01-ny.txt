The Second District's economy has shown further signs of improvement since   the last report, with indications of a modest pickup in the labor market; prices   remain relatively stable. Business contacts, in general, report some expansion   in activity, with manufacturing contacts also indicating that they are adding   workers. Retailers mostly report that holiday-season sales were roughly on par   with 2008 levels but ahead of plan; inventories were characterized as much   leaner going into the season than last year, leading to less discounting than in   2008 in most cases. Auto dealers report mixed sales results for November and   December, but they express a general sense of optimism about the outlook for   2010. Tourism activity in New York City showed some signs of tapering off   towards the end of the year. Commercial real estate markets were steady to   softer in the fourth quarter, with the sales/investment market remaining   moribund. Residential real estate markets showed signs of stabilizing. Finally,   bankers report steady demand for home mortgage loans but further weakening in   loan demand in other categories; they also note ongoing increases in delinquency   rates in all categories.
Auto dealers indicate mixed results: contacts in the Rochester area report   that sales continued to improve in November and early December and were running   ahead of comparable 2008 levels. In contrast, dealers in the Buffalo area   describe sales as sluggish, continuing to run roughly 20 percent lower than a   year earlier. Still auto dealers across western New York say they are optimistic   about sales prospects for 2010; they maintain that credit availability for   consumers has improved, but that the dealers themselves continue to face tight   "floor-plan" credit--a revolving credit line that a dealership uses to purchase   vehicles.
Tourism activity in New York City has been steady to weaker since the last   report. Manhattan hotels report that occupancy rates were steady at fairly high   levels in November and the first half of December and remained slightly above   comparable 2008 levels; room rates were still down roughly 15 percent from a   year earlier but appear to have leveled off since mid-year, when year-over-year   drops hovered around 30 percent. Broadway theaters report that attendance was   notably sluggish during this past holiday season: the seasonal pickup was much   weaker than usual, and December attendance fell below year-earlier levels,   though revenues were up modestly, reflecting higher ticket prices in 2009 than   in 2008. Finally, the Conference Board reports that consumer confidence among   residents of the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, Pa), declined modestly in   December.
Housing markets have been mixed but, on balance,   steady since the last report. Home sales reportedly slowed considerably in the   Buffalo area in November and early December, though prices remained higher than   a year ago; this slowing is partly attributed to the expiration of the [now   extended] homebuyer tax credit. Contacts in northern New Jersey report that   resale activity and prices have picked up modestly, though both remain at fairly   depressed levels; the uptick in prices may be partly due to fewer distress   sales. New home construction in northern New Jersey remains stable at an   exceptionally low level, with a modest pickup in multi-family development   offsetting further weakening in the single-family sector. New York City's   housing market has shown some signs of stabilizing. Co-op and condo prices   continued to decline in the fourth quarter but at a more moderate pace than   earlier in the year--in both Manhattan and the outer boroughs. Moreover, the   number of transactions picked up, both from the third quarter and from a year   earlier, and the inventory of unsold units, though still fairly high, fell 25   percent from late-2008 levels. Manhattan's apartment rental market also showed   signs of stabilizing in December, as both rents and inventories were virtually   unchanged from November. Still, rents remain well below year-earlier levels,   especially when landlord concessions (fee waivers and free rent for 1-2 months)   are factored in, though some of the more aggressive incentives are reportedly   being scaled back.
Looking at overall business conditions, both manufacturing and   non-manufacturing contacts report a pickup in activity; manufacturers remain   broadly optimistic, while non-manufacturers now express a less negative view of   the current business climate and are considerably more optimistic about the   general outlook than they have been in well over a year. Contacts report little   change in their selling prices, on balance, though a growing proportion indicate   some pickup in price pressures and expect input prices to rise in the months   ahead.
