First District business contacts report that activity has picked up in recent   months. For retailers and some advertising and consulting firms, the pickup has   led to flat to positive year-over-year sales, while manufacturers' revenues   mostly remain below year-earlier levels. A couple of commercial real estate   contacts see very modest improvement while others remain downbeat; residential   real estate sales (but not prices) are up substantially in response to the 2009   new homebuyers' tax credit. Prices are generally said to be stable, except for   selected metals prices, which are reported to be rising. With some exceptions,   First District business respondents say employment is level or up slightly; some   firms intend to raise pay levels modestly in 2010. The outlook remains   cautious.
Contacts continue to manage inventory levels cautiously, with several   retailers reporting that levels have been intentionally decreased from prior   year. Capital spending also remains carefully controlled, with some contacts   cautiously increasing spending in ways they believe will enhance the company's   long-term growth potential. Respondents are increasing headcount in line with   new store openings and say hiring restrictions have been removed in order to   take advantage of available talent. A few contacts indicate that merit increases   have been restored. Selling prices are reportedly stable.
Manufacturers report that metals prices are rising, but that most other   materials costs continue to hold steady. Some respondents are planning to raise   prices for services or nondurable products. After a period marked by price   erosion, a maker of building equipment is considering raising selling prices in   response to higher metals costs; on the other hand, a furnishings manufacturer   reports continued downward pressure on prices and no ability to pass along   higher input costs. Most other contacts indicate that selling prices are holding   steady.
Having reduced employment levels over the past year, most contacts are now   holding domestic headcounts relatively steady or increasing them modestly. Some   anticipate making further reductions in 2010, however. Manufacturers' budgets   call for merit pay increases of under 3 percent in the coming year. Many firms   expect to adjust the timing and/or magnitudes of pay and benefit adjustments in   response to business developments.
Manufacturing respondents are planning for level or slightly higher capital   spending in the New Year, mostly financed internally. Contacts indicate that   they have adequate plant capacity to meet somewhat higher demand. Some firms are   planning new investments in IT, factory reorganization, or product development.   Several respondents mention the possibility of making acquisitions.
Manufacturers and related services providers are guardedly optimistic about   business conditions over the coming 6 to 12 months. Contacts expect growth in   revenues and profits, but they cite a variety of factors that are likely to   constrain the extent of recovery or possibly even derail it.
Contacted companies continue to experience price pressures but are managing   to hold prices steady or to negotiate supplier's prices in the fourth quarter.   Contacted firms plan to raise prices by 3 percent to 10 percent in 2010. Hiring   will increase in most firms to hold workforce stable or to increase headcounts   to keep up with sharp demand increases. Base compensation will go up   modestly--by 2 percent to 5 percent--in 2010. Bonuses in some firms are expected   to be much higher next year than this.
Contacted advertising and consulting firms say they are either cautiously or   very optimistic about next year's outlook. Projections of demand growth range   from zero percent to 50 percent. Cost controls, increases in demand, and new   sales strategies are expected to drive profitability up in 2010.
Two contacts currently express greater optimism concerning the outlook for   2010 than in the previous report, while others remain pessimistic or uncertain.   The sources of optimism include anticipated demand for commercial space by the   public sector, positive GDP growth forecasts, and stock-market-related   improvements in investor sentiment. Sources of pessimism include weakness in   retail sales, slow employment growth, and looming bank failures related to   commercial real estate loans.
Home prices did not show as much improvement as sales in November. Median   prices declined modestly year-over-year in New Hampshire and Maine, while   increasing by about 1 percent in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. However, as in   recent months, median prices were probably affected by the concentration of   sales among first-time homebuyers. Condo markets also saw large sales increases   and moderate price declines in November.
