Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to pick up slightly during   the reporting period of December through the beginning of January. Upward   pressures on prices were quite modest, and upward pressures on wages were   virtually nonexistent, despite sustained productivity gains in some sectors.   Holiday season retail sales were up from the preceding year but were slow   compared with prior years, while demand for services remained weak on net.   Manufacturing activity continued at very low levels for some product lines but   appeared to improve further on balance. Agricultural producers reported solid   sales, while demand was mixed for providers of energy resources. Conditions in   housing markets appeared to be largely stable, but demand for commercial real   estate continued to deteriorate. Contacts from financial institutions reported   mostly stable loan demand and further declines in credit quality.
Upward wage pressures were largely absent, as compensation gains were held   down by high unemployment and limited hiring in most sectors and regions. The   majority of contacts expect that the pace of productivity improvements achieved   in their respective industries over the past year will continue in 2010; they   therefore expect hiring to remain subdued for a prolonged period, even if   product demand improves.
Demand for services continued to be weak overall. Sales slid further for   providers of professional services, notably advertising and accounting, and   providers of real estate services such as title insurance reported that activity   was largely stable at low levels. By contrast, providers of health-care services   reported improved demand and increased patient volumes during the reporting   period. Travel and tourism activity in the District was mixed: contacts in   Southern California and Seattle noted that occupancy rates were down, while   contacts in Hawaii and Las Vegas pointed to further improvements in visitor   volumes. Activity was especially sluggish in the business travel segment of the   market, which continued to place downward pressure on airline passenger volumes   and traffic.
