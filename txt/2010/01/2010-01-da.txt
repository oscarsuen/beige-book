Economic conditions in the Eleventh District continued to firm up over the   past six weeks. Contacts in several industries, most notably retail, high-tech   manufacturing and staffing services, reported improved demand. While conditions   appeared to be recovering in many sectors and outlooks were becoming more   positive, most contacts only expected a slow and modest improvement in the near   term. Prices Price pressures were generally subdued, with a few   exceptions. Intermodal firms continued to drop prices to attract new customers,   and legal, staffing and accounting service firms noted ongoing pressure to   discount fees. Pricing of construction-related materials remained very   competitive. In contrast, staffing firms said that a large increase in the state   unemployment insurance tax in January 2010 will significantly raise costs and   squeeze margins as pass-through to clients has been mixed. Airlines noted that   fares were stabilizing, and retailers said prices were reverting back to   relatively normal levels. Paper and corrugated-box manufacturers reported rising   raw material costs and an uptick in selling prices. There were also reports of   slight increases in crop and industrial metal prices. Crude oil prices briefly fell below $70 during the reporting period, but have   climbed back up to near $80. These gains have been driven by improved economic   data, longer-term dollar weakness, and conflicts involving Russia, Iran and   Nigeria. Contacts noted that proposed price increases for polyethylene and   polypropylene did not stick in December. Prices of other chemical products were   stable. Despite recent increases in natural gas prices due to cold weather,   contacts said high inventories, weak industrial demand and rising production   point to continued weakness in natural gas markets. Labor Market Most respondents noted stable employment   levels. Still, a few construction-related manufacturing firms continued to   report payroll declines. Contacts in the energy industry reported that several   firms had announced plans to reorganize operations and move a large number of   professional jobs overseas. On a positive note, an aircraft components   manufacturer noted an uptick in staff levels, and a primary metals manufacturer   reported an increase in work hours. Retailers said holiday hiring was   reasonable. Wage pressures were mostly nonexistent but a handful of firms said they   planned on giving small pay increases next year. Although employer matches to   401(k) plans remained suspended at most firms, one company reported plans to   partially reinstate employer contributions to retirement plans. Manufacturing Construction-related manufacturers reported   continued weakness in demand. Most contacts say there is excess capacity in the   industry, and capital spending plans are on hold except for maintenance-related   projects. The outlook remains bleak, especially for manufacturers tied to   commercial construction. Fabricated metals producers noted no change in   demand. Contacts in high-tech manufacturing report orders and sales continue to grow   at a moderate to strong pace, partly due to continued improvement in the world   economy. One respondent noted that Windows 7 was helping personal computer   sales, and that demand for smart phones and laptops was increasing strongly.   Inventories remain very lean but at desired levels. The outlook is for continued   moderate to strong growth over the next six months. Reports from transportation manufacturers were mixed. Aircraft components   manufacturers reported a seasonal decline in demand, but remained positive in   their outlook for next year. Manufacturers of emergency vehicles noted a   slowdown in the pace of orders, and added that thinning backlogs were pointing   to a potential slowdown in business around mid-2010. Demand for corrugated   packaging continued to improve, and outlooks for 2010 were optimistic. Food   producers reported a seasonal pickup in demand. Demand for petrochemicals was little changed. Modest gains in domestic demand   continued but growth in exports slowed somewhat. Contacts say with new   petrochemical facilities coming on line in the Middle East, processors are   holding back on building inventories until they see the effect of these new   facilities on U.S. exports. Retail Retail activity increased during the reporting   period, and retailers said that the holiday season was shaping up to be a   reasonable one. Discount stores reported an uptick in demand for non-food items,   with sales of electronics and household goods faring better than expected.   Department store sales were also ahead of expectations. Still, discounting was   prevalent as consumers remained price-conscious. The outlook is cautiously   optimistic, with contacts expecting a slow recovery in business. Automobile sales held steady over the past six weeks. Contacts say the worst   has passed, and they expect demand to remain flat in the near term. Services Staffing firms said demand for contract work   continued to improve but orders for direct hires were flat at low levels.   Although orders were widespread across sectors, demand was strongest for call   center, clerical, healthcare administrative and manufacturing staff. Demand for   legal services remains depressed, but contacts noted a slight uptick in   inquiries from clients on merger and acquisition-related services. Accounting   firms reported steady demand for their services. Reports from transportation service firms were mixed. Intermodal firms   reported no improvement in cargo volumes over the past month as imports have   dropped and exports are not picking up as expected. Small parcel shipping and   large freight volumes increased further, continuing a trend that began in the   summer. Contacts in railroad transportation noted continued declines in cargo   volumes as increases in grain, chemicals, petroleum products and automobile   shipments were more than offset by declines in shipments of coal, pulp, paper,   lumber, wood, crushed stone and metals. Airline demand appears to be recovering,   fares are stabilizing, and contacts note that the outlook is slightly brighter   for 2010. Construction and Real Estate New and existing home sales   rose over the past six weeks. Homebuilders said that while overall starts   remained at low levels, the momentum from the homebuyer tax credit was helping   demand, especially in the entry-level segment. Prices continued to firm. Several   contacts said smaller builders were still unable to access credit to finance new   construction. Outlooks were guarded but optimistic. Conditions in the apartment sector were weak, as occupancy rates continue to   fall and rents are edging down. Elevated construction activity has led to an   oversupply of apartments, although contacts say activity will slow in the near   term. Outlooks are modestly optimistic. Respondents expect a recovery in most of   the major Texas markets in 2010. Office and industrial leasing activity remained feeble. Contacts said   "nothing is going on and business is very slow." There is still some concern   over how commercial real estate loans will be worked out as they come due, given   the decline in collateral value. Investor interest continues to rise, however,   with one respondent reporting a significant increase in the number of bids for   properties on sale. Financial Services Loan demand remained soft. Commercial   real estate lending was scarce, and community banks continued to curtail   residential real estate lending due to tough regulatory requirements. Loan   pricing was slowly returning back to "normal," as some contacts have removed   pricing floors or returned to original base rates such as prime. Deposit growth   was steady but credit quality continued to deteriorate. Despite weak conditions,   contacts at most financial services firms--excluding those that failed--said   they have managed to end the year with flat or very modest growth in loan   volumes. The primary concern among most contacts is still the uncertainty   surrounding impending regulation. The outlook remained cautious and most   contacts said they did not expect any significant improvement until at least   fourth quarter of 2010. Energy The rig count continued to rise over the past six   weeks. Current oil prices are driving up most types of oil-directed drilling   activity. The increase in shale-based natural gas drilling, however, remains   focused in a few areas, with some traditional gas-bearing regions continuing to   see consolidation and downsizing. Agriculture Rainfall continues to boost agricultural   conditions across the state. Farmers have been able to plant the winter wheat   crop into moist soil. Nearly all crops have been harvested, and the crop outlook   for 2010 has improved. Although drought conditions have been alleviated, the dry   spell has tightened producers' cash flow and contacts say delayed disaster   payments may prevent some farmers from planting the next round of crops.
