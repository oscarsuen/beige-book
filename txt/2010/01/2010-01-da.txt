Economic conditions in the Eleventh District continued to firm up over the   past six weeks. Contacts in several industries, most notably retail, high-tech   manufacturing and staffing services, reported improved demand. While conditions   appeared to be recovering in many sectors and outlooks were becoming more   positive, most contacts only expected a slow and modest improvement in the near   term.
Crude oil prices briefly fell below $70 during the reporting period, but have   climbed back up to near $80. These gains have been driven by improved economic   data, longer-term dollar weakness, and conflicts involving Russia, Iran and   Nigeria. Contacts noted that proposed price increases for polyethylene and   polypropylene did not stick in December. Prices of other chemical products were   stable. Despite recent increases in natural gas prices due to cold weather,   contacts said high inventories, weak industrial demand and rising production   point to continued weakness in natural gas markets.
Wage pressures were mostly nonexistent but a handful of firms said they   planned on giving small pay increases next year. Although employer matches to   401(k) plans remained suspended at most firms, one company reported plans to   partially reinstate employer contributions to retirement plans.
Contacts in high-tech manufacturing report orders and sales continue to grow   at a moderate to strong pace, partly due to continued improvement in the world   economy. One respondent noted that Windows 7 was helping personal computer   sales, and that demand for smart phones and laptops was increasing strongly.   Inventories remain very lean but at desired levels. The outlook is for continued   moderate to strong growth over the next six months.
Reports from transportation manufacturers were mixed. Aircraft components   manufacturers reported a seasonal decline in demand, but remained positive in   their outlook for next year. Manufacturers of emergency vehicles noted a   slowdown in the pace of orders, and added that thinning backlogs were pointing   to a potential slowdown in business around mid-2010. Demand for corrugated   packaging continued to improve, and outlooks for 2010 were optimistic. Food   producers reported a seasonal pickup in demand.
Demand for petrochemicals was little changed. Modest gains in domestic demand   continued but growth in exports slowed somewhat. Contacts say with new   petrochemical facilities coming on line in the Middle East, processors are   holding back on building inventories until they see the effect of these new   facilities on U.S. exports.
Automobile sales held steady over the past six weeks. Contacts say the worst   has passed, and they expect demand to remain flat in the near term.
Reports from transportation service firms were mixed. Intermodal firms   reported no improvement in cargo volumes over the past month as imports have   dropped and exports are not picking up as expected. Small parcel shipping and   large freight volumes increased further, continuing a trend that began in the   summer. Contacts in railroad transportation noted continued declines in cargo   volumes as increases in grain, chemicals, petroleum products and automobile   shipments were more than offset by declines in shipments of coal, pulp, paper,   lumber, wood, crushed stone and metals. Airline demand appears to be recovering,   fares are stabilizing, and contacts note that the outlook is slightly brighter   for 2010.
Conditions in the apartment sector were weak, as occupancy rates continue to   fall and rents are edging down. Elevated construction activity has led to an   oversupply of apartments, although contacts say activity will slow in the near   term. Outlooks are modestly optimistic. Respondents expect a recovery in most of   the major Texas markets in 2010.
Office and industrial leasing activity remained feeble. Contacts said   "nothing is going on and business is very slow." There is still some concern   over how commercial real estate loans will be worked out as they come due, given   the decline in collateral value. Investor interest continues to rise, however,   with one respondent reporting a significant increase in the number of bids for   properties on sale.
