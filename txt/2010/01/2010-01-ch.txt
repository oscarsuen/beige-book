Economic activity in the Seventh District increased in December. Contacts   expected activity to continue to rise into 2010, although the pace of recovery   was likely to be moderate. Consumer spending increased, while business spending   was little changed. Manufacturing improved, but construction remained weak.   Commercial real estate conditions deteriorated, but residential real estate   activity continued to pick up. Credit conditions improved marginally. Price   pressures increased for raw materials, while wage pressures were minimal. Prices   for soybeans, wheat, milk, and hogs moved higher, while corn and cattle prices   moved lower. Consumer Spending Consumer spending increased in   December. The holiday shopping season was better than a year ago, particularly   for sales of clothing, toys, gift cards and entertainment items. Customers   remained price sensitive, and there were considerably more specials and   promotions this year as retailers were willing to accept lower margins to   attract consumers. Inventories declined from their already low levels, and   contacts indicated that some stores were starting to run out of items in high   demand. Sales of consumer durables and luxury items remained weaker, but   contacts also reported greater optimism that demand was building for big-ticket   items like household appliances. Early in December, auto sales were at the same   pace as the previous reporting period, but then picked up later in the month.   Contacts noted that GM dealer incentives put in place to clear discontinued   inventory by year-end boosted sales of Pontiacs and Saturns. Business Spending Business spending was little changed   from the previous reporting period. Most contacts expected to maintain their   current level of capital expenditures in 2010, noting that sales and capacity   utilization had yet to improve enough to justify higher expenditures on plant   and equipment. Furthermore, a manufacturing contact noted that equipment   capacity was not a problem in his industry; but with the deep cuts to the labor   force over the past year, workers would be the greater need to meet projected   growth. Current labor market conditions continued to be weak, although the   volume of large layoffs declined and some permanent hiring was reported. Several   contacts noted an increase in the demand for temporary workers. In addition, a   large staffing firm reported that billable hours increased, particularly from   the manufacturing sector and larger businesses. In contrast, permanent hiring   continued to be low. A recruitment firm indicated that the transition from   temporary to permanent hiring will likely take longer than following recent   downturns as employers are remaining particularly conservative in their hiring   plans coming out of this recession. Construction and Real estate Construction activity   remained weak in December. Residential development picked up slightly for   single-family homes, but remained at a low level for condominiums and townhomes.   Contacts indicated that builders were being cautious, working off existing   undeveloped lots and planning to maintain low levels of spec homes. In contrast,   sales continued to increase. The extension and expansion of the federal   homebuyer tax credit contributed to higher sales, although a contact noted that   it was having a smaller impact than expected on the single-family market. In the   multifamily market, many sales were driven by steep price discounts. Demand   continued to be weak for nonresidential construction, although a contact   indicated that interest had increased from his manufacturing, particularly   automotive-related, customers. Commercial real estate conditions deteriorated   further. Vacancy rates and subleasing activity increased putting additional   downward pressure on rents. Manufacturing Manufacturing activity improved in   December. Manufacturers with ties to the auto industry noted further improvement   in demand. In addition, exporters, particularly those to Asia, continued to do   well. In general, contacts noted that order books were filling up for the first   quarter of 2010, and many expected to see a further uptick in production in the   coming months. While overall activity remained low, pending changes to EPA   emissions standards continued to benefit manufacturers of medium and heavy-duty   trucks and parts; although this was seen as quickly waning going into 2010.   Contacts generally expected that the gradual improvement in activity since last   summer would continue into 2010. For instance, a contact noted that his business   was likely to benefit from the fact that several large customers had freed up   funds for capital expenditures put on hold in 2009. However, some contacts   expressed doubt as to whether the current pace of recovery was sustainable. For   example, a contact indicated that his customers were unlikely to increase their   orders until their own sales had improved for a considerable period. Banking and Finance Credit conditions improved marginally   in December. Credit spreads narrowed; and even with longer-term yields   increasing, net corporate funding costs for a number of District firms declined.   Banking contacts reported little change in business loan demand with continued   low utilization of credit lines and most C&I lending going to refinance or   pay off existing debt. Contacts did, however, indicate an uptick in financing   for mergers and acquisitions as well as investment in distressed real estate. In   contrast, small businesses continued to report difficulty in obtaining bank   credit. Declines in asset quality showed further signs of leveling off and,   outside of commercial real estate, were expected to improve in 2010. Consumer   loan demand increased slightly, with credit card receivables ticking up and low   mortgage rates continuing to stimulate mortgage lending. Charge-off and   delinquency rates were reported to be better than expected, and several contacts   expected to see further improvement in 2010. Prices and Costs Price pressures increased for raw   materials in December. Contacts indicated that lead times were rising as   supplier capacity had yet to be fully brought back on-line while foreign and   domestic demand continued to improve. Many expected a further round of commodity   price increases to ensue in the first quarter of 2010. Recent tax increases were   also indicated to be putting pressure on wholesale prices of items like   cigarettes and soft drinks. However, pass-through of cost pressures to   downstream prices was small on balance, as contacts indicated pricing power   remained limited in many industries. Wage pressures were minimal, although union   wage increases were noted by some construction contacts as putting additional   pressure on costs. Agriculture Some farmers still had corn in the field when   snows blanketed the ground in December. The weather also prevented much of the   normal fall tillage and fertilizer application. Still, corn and soybean yields   were above average throughout the District. Furthermore, storage of the crop has   not been a problem, since end users, especially ethanol plants, kept buying   grain as it was harvested. Even with increased drying costs, corn prices were   high enough for returns to approach breakeven; and with soybean prices moving   higher, most farmers should more than cover their costs for soybeans. Wheat,   milk, and hog prices also increased, whereas corn and cattle prices decreased   from the previous reporting period. The reduced number of dairy cows helped   boost milk prices. Some small dairy operations or those that raise their own   feed were able to avoid further losses. Smaller dairy producers continued to   benefit from government payments that larger producers had tapped out. Hog farms   also drew closer to breakeven, but cattle operators faced pressures made worse   by very cold temperatures which required the consumption of extra feed.
