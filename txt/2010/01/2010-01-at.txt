On balance, reports from contacts for late November through December   suggested overall economic conditions improved in the Sixth District. Most   merchants remarked that holiday sales were slightly better than expected, while   vehicle dealers noted a pickup in traffic and sales. Hospitality industry   contacts observed that while current conditions remained weak, they saw some   signs of improvement going into 2010. The information on home sales was mixed.   The majority of Realtors reported that existing home sales were above year-ago   levels, whereas new home sales and construction activity remained soft. The   proportion of manufacturers reporting an increase in new orders and production   moved lower in December. Most banking contacts reported that credit standards   were unchanged relative to late November. There were fewer reports of layoffs in   the District in December, but seasonal hiring was also described as being weaker   than last year. Prices remained relatively stable for most businesses.
Tourism-related spending remained sluggish throughout the District. Industry   contacts reported that hotel reservations and room rates remained below year-ago   levels, but the near-term outlook was showing signs of improvement. South   Florida hotels and restaurants are expected to gain from two major National   Football League events coming to the area in late January and early February.   Cruise lines are also reporting strong bookings for 2010, mostly because of   heavy discounting.
Commercial construction activity remained at very low levels according to   reports from contractors. More projects were put on hold, resulting in less   activity expected to get underway for the early part of 2010. Commercial vacancy   rates remained elevated and contacts continued to report downward pressure on   rents.
Lending varied across the District, with increases noted in mortgage   refinancing and loans to tax-exempt entities. Businesses also appeared to be   shopping around for better loan terms, especially where more restrictions had   been placed on loan renewals with the current lender. Contacts also noted an   increase in credit requests from "unqualified" applicants.
District homebuilders continued to note stable input prices for the reporting   period, while most retailers noted that retail prices remained at or slightly   down from last year.
