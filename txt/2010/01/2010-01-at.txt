On balance, reports from contacts for late November through December   suggested overall economic conditions improved in the Sixth District. Most   merchants remarked that holiday sales were slightly better than expected, while   vehicle dealers noted a pickup in traffic and sales. Hospitality industry   contacts observed that while current conditions remained weak, they saw some   signs of improvement going into 2010. The information on home sales was mixed.   The majority of Realtors reported that existing home sales were above year-ago   levels, whereas new home sales and construction activity remained soft. The   proportion of manufacturers reporting an increase in new orders and production   moved lower in December. Most banking contacts reported that credit standards   were unchanged relative to late November. There were fewer reports of layoffs in   the District in December, but seasonal hiring was also described as being weaker   than last year. Prices remained relatively stable for most businesses. Consumer Spending and Tourism The majority of District   retailers indicated that holiday sales were better than expected and that   discounts were not as deep as last year. Some retailers noted they had lowered   prices on certain items in order to draw customers in hopes that they would also   purchase other goods with higher margins. Overall, retailers continued to keep   inventory levels low. The outlook among merchants was mixed, with almost half   expecting a decrease in sales and a third expecting an increase in sales in the   first few months of 2010. District vehicle sales remained below the level of a   year earlier, but most contacts reported a pickup in year-end activity. Tourism-related spending remained sluggish throughout the District. Industry   contacts reported that hotel reservations and room rates remained below year-ago   levels, but the near-term outlook was showing signs of improvement. South   Florida hotels and restaurants are expected to gain from two major National   Football League events coming to the area in late January and early February.   Cruise lines are also reporting strong bookings for 2010, mostly because of   heavy discounting. Real Estate and Construction Reports from District   housing contacts were mixed during November and December. The majority of   Realtors reported that existing home sales remained above year earlier levels,   while homebuilder reports indicated that new home sales fell below year earlier   levels. Realtors noted that the housing stimulus continued to boost sales. The   near-term outlook among most contacts improved modestly. However, construction   activity remained soft, while homebuilders continued to report difficulty in   competing with bank-owned property. Commercial construction activity remained at very low levels according to   reports from contractors. More projects were put on hold, resulting in less   activity expected to get underway for the early part of 2010. Commercial vacancy   rates remained elevated and contacts continued to report downward pressure on   rents. Manufacturing and Transportation After improving in   November, production levels in the District's manufacturing plants contracted in   December. Fewer contacts reported increased production levels and more noted   cutbacks. Likewise, new orders slipped in December after rising during the   previous month. With regard to finished inventory, about half of manufacturing   contacts noted cutbacks in inventory in November, while in December forty   percent reported reductions. Transportation contacts indicated that freight   demand remained weak but had modestly improved over the past month. Railway   contacts reported that regional rail shipments were flat from a year earlier   with gains seen in shipments of motor vehicles, chemicals, and some metals. Banking and Finance Most banking contacts noted that   credit standards remained relatively tight for most types of loans. Banks   continued to require more documentation and allowed fewer exceptions than had   been the case in recent years. A few contacts reported easing credit terms for   their strongest customers. However, most reports noted a tightening of credit   standards for commercial real estate loans. Lending varied across the District, with increases noted in mortgage   refinancing and loans to tax-exempt entities. Businesses also appeared to be   shopping around for better loan terms, especially where more restrictions had   been placed on loan renewals with the current lender. Contacts also noted an   increase in credit requests from "unqualified" applicants. Employment and Prices Reports of layoffs continued to   decelerate throughout the District in November and December. However,   holiday-related hiring also appeared to be weaker than normal. Firms remained   reluctant to hire permanent staff, but some noted increasing temporary hiring   and an increase in hours. A few firms also noted that they do not anticipate   bringing their workforce back to previous levels because of the efficiencies   realized from recent layoffs. Many firms and government entities continued to   enforce wage freezes. District homebuilders continued to note stable input prices for the reporting   period, while most retailers noted that retail prices remained at or slightly   down from last year. Natural Resources and Agriculture District crude oil   production continued to increase moderately in November through mid-December,   with the number of rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico up slightly from lows   seen in August. Despite the increased production, crude inventories in the   region continued to drop as cold weather and holiday travel boosted energy   consumption. Most District areas reported excessive surplus soil moisture levels   in November and December. Unusually cold temperatures in parts of Florida during   early January may have impacted the state's citrus crop.
