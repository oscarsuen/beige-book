The Tenth District economy expanded more modestly in late November and   December than in the previous survey period. Overall holiday consumer spending   was little changed from a year ago, but sales in some areas were hampered by   extremely bad year-end weather. Growth in manufacturing activity moderated from   the previous survey, and businesses' capital spending plans remained modest. The   rebound in residential real estate lost some steam, and commercial construction   activity weakened further. Bank loan demand remained sluggish, and overall loan   quality was poor. By contrast, energy activity continued to rise from low   levels, and agricultural conditions improved. Price pressures were limited, and   wage pressures remained low due to weakness in the labor market.
