Economic conditions in some areas of the Eighth District have shown further   signs of improvement since our previous report. In general, manufacturing   activity continued to decline while service sector activity increased. Early   reports from retailers in the District indicate a slight increase in holiday   sales compared with a year ago. Residential real estate markets showed signs of   improvement in parts of the District, while commercial real estate market   conditions remained weak. Overall lending at a sample of small and mid-sized   District banks declined in the three-month period from mid-September to   mid-December.
The District's service sector continued to expand in most areas. Contacts in   business support services, leisure/hospitality services, and medical services   announced plans to hire new workers. A firm in business support services also   announced plans to lift a wage freeze and to reinstate benefits. Early reports   from contacts in the retail sector generally expressed optimism about increased   holiday sales. One contact also noted that small to mid-sized retailers are   adding stores to gain long-term market share.
Commercial and industrial real estate market conditions remained weak   throughout most of the District. A contact in St. Louis noted that commercial   real estate has stalled. A contact in Memphis noted that the focus now is on   retaining tenants rather than recruiting new ones. A contact in south-central   Kentucky reported that while commercial construction is relatively strong, it   consists mainly of education-related projects. Industrial real estate and   construction contacts throughout the District also reported a sluggish   environment. A contact in Memphis does not expect the industrial real estate   market to improve until signs of a more sustainable recovery are evident.
