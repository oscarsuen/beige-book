The economy in the Fourth District has shown some signs of improvement since   our last report, although overall activity remains at a low level. Reports from   manufacturers indicated that production was stable or slightly up, with several   citing growth opportunities in off-shore markets. Little change was seen in   new-home construction, whereas non-residential builders reported a small   increase in contract awards. Financing remains a major issue for residential and   commercial contractors. Sales by District retailers and auto dealers were flat.   Energy production held steady, and reports showed a slight upturn in freight   transport volume. Business and consumer lending activity remains soft, while the   growth rate in core deposits is starting to decline.
The labor market remains weak, but some business owners started recalling a   few workers or increased production hours. Staffing-firm representatives   reported an increased number of job openings, especially in the healthcare   industry. Given the weak labor market, wage pressures are contained. We heard   many reports of rising prices for metals, especially steel. Otherwise, raw   material and product pricing were relatively stable. Capital spending and   inventories remain under tight control.
Manufacturers reported that they have completed rebalancing their   inventories. Capacity utilization is holding steady, but at rates substantially   below pre-recession levels. Investment in capital projects remains weak, with   spending expected to continue on the low side during 2010. We heard many reports   of a rise in metal prices (especially steel). Steel increases were attributed to   rising scrap costs, which prompted steel producers and service centers to raise   their own prices. Otherwise, the cost of raw materials was generally stable.   About half of our respondents said that they have increased work hours or   recalled a few production employees, and wage pressures are contained.
Reports on activity in non-residential construction, including public works,   were mixed. Although most of our contacts said that business has fallen on a   year-over-year basis and many have nearly depleted their backlogs, inquiries   have improved and we heard several reports of contract awards. A majority of   contractors now expect at least a slight improvement in activity during 2010. We   continue to hear numerous accounts of difficulties in obtaining financing and   refinancing. Construction material prices were stable. Half of our respondents   reported that they have reduced their workforces since our last report. Many   subcontractors are struggling and are charging substantially lower rates.
