Economic conditions in the Third District have been mixed since the last   Beige Book. Manufacturers, on balance, reported a modest increase in shipments   and new orders. Retailers indicated that sales increased marginally for the   holiday shopping period compared with a year ago. Motor vehicle dealers   indicated that sales have improved slightly. Third District banks continued to   report decreases in loan volume outstanding and further declines in credit   quality. Residential real estate agents and home builders said sales were   seasonally slow in December following an increase in November. Nonresidential   real estate leasing, purchase, and construction activity continued to decline.   Business firms in the region indicated that prices of most goods and services   have been steady, although reports of higher commodity prices have become more   widespread since the last Beige Book. The consensus among Third District business contacts is that business   conditions will improve slowly in most sectors during the first half of 2010.   Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next six   months, on balance. Retailers expect sales to rise if overall economic   conditions improve. Auto dealers expect sales in 2010 to be somewhat above the   level in 2009. Bankers expect demand for credit to pick up by mid-year.   Residential real estate contacts believe housing demand will rise as spring   approaches. In contrast, contacts in nonresidential real estate expect leasing   and construction to remain weak through most of the year. Manufacturing Third District manufacturers reported   increases in shipments and new orders, on balance, from November to December,   although the number of firms posting gains did not exceed the number recording   declines by a wide margin. Makers of food products, furniture, and chemicals   noted increased demand for their products. Declines in demand were reported from   most of the other major manufacturing sectors in the District. Firms reporting   increases in orders generally indicated that the gains have been slight. One   said that "business is getting a little better, but nothing to write home   about," and another said that "we're keeping busy but it's hand to mouth;   there's no backlog." Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance. Among the firms polled in December, about   four-tenths expect new orders and shipments to increase during the first half of   the year; about two-tenths expect decreases. Several firms noted that the   outlook for future taxes, health-care regulations, and energy costs were   negatively affecting their expectations as well as those of their customers.   Although the area manufacturers planning to increase capital spending outnumber   those planning to decrease capital spending, the positive ratio has not   increased since the last Beige Book. Retail Third District retailers reported marginal   year-over-year increases in sales, on balance, for December. A snowstorm on the   weekend before Christmas curtailed shopping, and many stores closed. However,   many stores were open for extended hours in the four days before Christmas, and   several retailers estimated that they recouped sales lost on the weekend.   Several Third District retailers noted that the sales improvement for the 2009   holiday period compared with 2008 did not represent a significant shift in the   sales trend. Poor results in 2008 made a gain for 2009 easier, according to this   view. Looking ahead, store executives say sales will increase significantly only   if employment and financial conditions improve. Some Third District auto dealers reported improvement in sales in December,   although, for most, sales have been roughly steady. Dealers said financing for   buyers has become somewhat more available, helping to support the sales rate.   Looking ahead, dealers expect total sales in 2010 to slightly exceed sales in   2009. Finance Total outstanding loan volume at Third District   banks continued to slip in December, according to bankers contacted for this   report. Bankers said lending activity has been soft in nearly all major consumer   and business credit categories, mainly due to slack demand, although some   lenders reported slow growth in their auto lending. Besides low demand, some   bankers indicated that overall loan volume was declining because of write-offs.   Credit quality remained a concern for Third District bankers. Although most of   those contacted for this report said delinquencies and defaults have been rising   less rapidly recently than they had through most of 2009, bankers expect   charge-offs to remain high for some time. Looking ahead, Third District bankers see slow loan growth starting around   mid-year as the economy recovers and loan demand picks up. Until then they   expect write-offs and the continuation of stringent credit standards to limit   expansion in lending. One banker said that "standards of lower loan-to-value   ratios and higher credit scores are being maintained and that will limit loan   growth," and another said that "we are focused on preserving capital and   minimizing future losses." Real Estate and Construction Sales of new and existing   homes were seasonally slow in December after a gain from October to November,   according to local real estate agents and home builders. Real estate agents said   the number of homes listed for sale remained high relative to the sales rate,   and average selling prices continued to fall. Most of the real estate agents   surveyed for this report characterized the market as "stabilizing" or "hitting   the bottom." They expect sales to rise in the spring with a boost from the   extended home-buyer federal tax credit. However, they do not expect sales prices   to begin to move up with the expected increase in sales. Most agreed with the   opinion expressed by one agent that "prices might begin to stabilize in   2010." Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that leasing, purchase, and   construction activity continued to decline as 2009 came to a close. They also   reported that vacancy rates remained on the rise. Contacts said that building   owners have been reducing rents as leases come due for renewals, and tenants   have been generally renewing leases for less space and shorter terms. One   contact said that "slower general business activity has resulted in many   properties not generating cash flow. They are not worth the same amount of money   they were worth a few years ago." According to this contact, recent and   prospective declines in commercial property values have induced many property   owners to withhold them from the market and have deterred many buyers from   making purchases. Contacts expect nonresidential real estate markets to remain   weak through most of 2010. Prices Reports on input costs and output prices have been   mixed since the last Beige Book. The number of manufacturing firms noting   increases for the commodities they use has risen, but most continued to report   that they have not raised the prices of the products they make. Retailers have   generally kept their selling prices steady, although discounts became more   common toward the end of the holiday shopping period. Business firms in all   sectors expect increases in energy costs and some commodity prices during   2010.
