Economic conditions in the Third District have been mixed since the last   Beige Book. Manufacturers, on balance, reported a modest increase in shipments   and new orders. Retailers indicated that sales increased marginally for the   holiday shopping period compared with a year ago. Motor vehicle dealers   indicated that sales have improved slightly. Third District banks continued to   report decreases in loan volume outstanding and further declines in credit   quality. Residential real estate agents and home builders said sales were   seasonally slow in December following an increase in November. Nonresidential   real estate leasing, purchase, and construction activity continued to decline.   Business firms in the region indicated that prices of most goods and services   have been steady, although reports of higher commodity prices have become more   widespread since the last Beige Book.
The consensus among Third District business contacts is that business   conditions will improve slowly in most sectors during the first half of 2010.   Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next six   months, on balance. Retailers expect sales to rise if overall economic   conditions improve. Auto dealers expect sales in 2010 to be somewhat above the   level in 2009. Bankers expect demand for credit to pick up by mid-year.   Residential real estate contacts believe housing demand will rise as spring   approaches. In contrast, contacts in nonresidential real estate expect leasing   and construction to remain weak through most of the year.
Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance. Among the firms polled in December, about   four-tenths expect new orders and shipments to increase during the first half of   the year; about two-tenths expect decreases. Several firms noted that the   outlook for future taxes, health-care regulations, and energy costs were   negatively affecting their expectations as well as those of their customers.   Although the area manufacturers planning to increase capital spending outnumber   those planning to decrease capital spending, the positive ratio has not   increased since the last Beige Book.
Some Third District auto dealers reported improvement in sales in December,   although, for most, sales have been roughly steady. Dealers said financing for   buyers has become somewhat more available, helping to support the sales rate.   Looking ahead, dealers expect total sales in 2010 to slightly exceed sales in   2009.
Looking ahead, Third District bankers see slow loan growth starting around   mid-year as the economy recovers and loan demand picks up. Until then they   expect write-offs and the continuation of stringent credit standards to limit   expansion in lending. One banker said that "standards of lower loan-to-value   ratios and higher credit scores are being maintained and that will limit loan   growth," and another said that "we are focused on preserving capital and   minimizing future losses."
Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that leasing, purchase, and   construction activity continued to decline as 2009 came to a close. They also   reported that vacancy rates remained on the rise. Contacts said that building   owners have been reducing rents as leases come due for renewals, and tenants   have been generally renewing leases for less space and shorter terms. One   contact said that "slower general business activity has resulted in many   properties not generating cash flow. They are not worth the same amount of money   they were worth a few years ago." According to this contact, recent and   prospective declines in commercial property values have induced many property   owners to withhold them from the market and have deterred many buyers from   making purchases. Contacts expect nonresidential real estate markets to remain   weak through most of 2010.
