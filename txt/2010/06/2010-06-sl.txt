Retail and auto sales in April and early May   increased over a year ago. Residential real estate market conditions improved   throughout the District, while commercial and industrial market conditions   continued to lag behind. Overall lending activity at a sample of large District   banks increased modestly in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the fourth   quarter of 2009.

The District's services sector activity has been mixed since our previous   report. A firm in business support services announced job layoffs in response to   decreased demand. A major electrical utility announced layoffs at several power   plants and support service facilities.
