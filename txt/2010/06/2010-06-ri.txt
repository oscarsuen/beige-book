Economic activity in the Fifth District continued to post moderate gains   across most sectors from weak levels. Manufacturing continued to be a bright   spot, with contacts indicating slow-but-steady expansion across a broad range of   industries. Banks and other services-providing firms, also cited improvements   over the last six to eight weeks, with scattered reports of weaker activity. For   example, several professional services firms reported rising revenues, but an   executive at a large healthcare organization stated that demand was weaker than   expected. The real estate market sent mostly positive signals. In a striking   change from recent months, several contacts noted a pickup in the high end of   the market. Retail sales activity was virtually unchanged in recent weeks, but   auto sales improved. While several temp agencies reported improving demand,   other labor market indicators were weak. Slight increases in commodity and   component prices were noted by manufacturing and services firms.
Commercial real estate agents reported modest improvements since our last   report.
For example, vacancy rates for office space in Columbia, S.C., and Charlotte,   N.C., markets decreased due to positive absorption, but were stable in Richmond.   Leasing activity eased in Charlotte and demand was unchanged at a weak level. A   slight pick-up in retail leasing was reported in Richmond. Rental rates remained   stable in most sectors. New construction remained generally nonexistent.   However, a construction contractor reported starting a 100-percent speculative   office building in a suburban area and indicated he would like to start a second   one in the near future. He felt confident that the new buildings would attract   tenants shying away from more urban locations.
