Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and based   on information collected on or before May 28, 2010. This document summarizes   comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve   and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.
Economic activity continued to improve since the last report across all   twelve Federal Reserve Districts, although many Districts described the pace of   growth as "modest." Consumer spending and tourism activity generally increased.   Business spending also rose, on net, with employment and capital spending edging   up but inventory investment slowing. By sector, nonfinancial services,   manufacturing, and transportation continued to gradually improve. Residential   real estate activity in many Districts was buoyed by the April deadline for the   homebuyer tax credit. Commercial real estate remained weak, although some   Districts reported an increase in leasing. Financial activity was little changed   on balance, although a few Districts noted a modest increase in lending. Spring   planting was generally ahead of the normal pace, while conditions in the natural   resource sectors varied across the Districts. Prices of final goods and services   were largely stable as higher input costs were not being passed along to   customers and wage pressures continued to be minimal.
Wage pressures were limited, although San Francisco noted upward pressure on   employee benefit costs. Prices of final goods and services were largely   unchanged in most Districts as higher input costs were not being passed along to   customers and wage pressures continued to be minimal. Steel prices in many   Districts moved higher, as did lumber and food prices, while energy prices   generally declined. Several Districts noted tighter commodity supply conditions,   with Richmond and Kansas City indicating an increase in supplier lead times and   Boston and Atlanta reporting supply chain capacity constraints. Transportation   costs moved up in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco   Districts, but diesel fuel cost pressures eased in New York.
