The Tenth District economy grew modestly since the last survey with   expectations of further improvement in the coming months. Consumer sales edged   up at retail stores and auto dealerships, and District contacts were hopeful   that rising consumer confidence would boost future sales. Residential real   estate activity improved slightly, but real estate agents expected expiring tax   credits to weigh on the housing rebound. While the commercial real estate market   remained stressed, District contacts noted a slight improvement in leasing   activity.
Manufacturing activity expanded modestly, transportation activity   strengthened, and factory managers expected further production gains. Bankers   reported improved expectations for loan quality, and credit standards were   generally unchanged. Energy activity expanded further as oil and natural gas   production increased. Agricultural conditions improved with higher livestock   profits and farmland values. Despite higher input prices, retail prices and wage   pressures remained low, and few firms planned to pass through additional costs   to consumers.
