The Ninth District economy grew at a steady pace since the last report.   Consumer spending, tourism, residential real estate and construction, services,   manufacturing, energy, mining and agriculture saw increases. Commercial real   estate was flat at low levels, and commercial construction activity was slow.   Some signs of strengthening were noted in labor markets. Wage increases were   subdued, and overall prices remained level.
Automotive dealers in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area reported that car sales   and maintenance and repair business were up from a year earlier. April new car   sales were up significantly higher from March in Montana and the Upper Peninsula   of Michigan, but were down slightly in western Wisconsin.
Tourism contacts are optimistic for the summer season. An official in the   Upper Peninsula reported that tourism traffic was starting to look pretty good   and a strong summer season is expected. The number of nonresident visitors to   Montana is expected to increase 2 percent compared with a year ago after a flat   year in 2009, according to state tourism officials. Inquiries about summer   tourism activities were strong in Duluth, Minn. However, recent leisure bookings   by a Minnesota travel agency were down during April and May, and advanced   bookings for the summer season were slow.
Commercial real estate was slow. The amount of unused space in the retail   market in Minneapolis increased by 135,000 square feet during the first quarter.   An industry contact in northern Wisconsin noted that nearly every sector in his   area was overbuilt. Residential real estate saw continued slow growth. April   home prices increased in Minneapolis-St. Paul for the fourth consecutive month,   the longest period of increasing prices since 2004. Brokers in Fargo, N.D., and   Duluth, Minn., noted increased activity in April as home buyers took advantage   of the federal tax credit before its expiration. Contacts around the District   reported increased housing short sales for distressed properties.
Despite signs of improvement, overall labor markets remained weak. In   Montana, a recent job fair attracted hundreds of job seekers for openings at   almost 50 companies. A wood furniture factory and chain of stores in Montana   recently went out of business, affecting over 60 workers statewide. Almost 50   workers were laid off by a defense contractor in Minnesota.
Wage increases were subdued. According to respondents to a recent St. Cloud   (Minn.) Area Business Outlook Survey, only 18 percent expect to increase   employee compensation at their companies over the next six months. In last   year's survey, 21 percent expected to increase compensation. Several temporary   staffing firms noted flat to lower wages. The majority of respondents from the   Minneapolis Fed's preliminary survey of professional business services firms   indicated no increases in wages for the next year. A nurses union in   Minneapolis-St. Paul recently approved a one-day strike in response to   negotiations with area hospitals, which had proposed to change work rules, cut   pensions, and reduce health benefits.
Overall prices remained level. Some price pressures were noted in materials   for large construction projects; however, in recent weeks, prices for oil,   copper, and some steel products decreased. In addition, fertilizer prices were   down from a year ago.
