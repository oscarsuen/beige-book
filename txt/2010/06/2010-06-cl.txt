The economy in the Fourth District showed further signs of strengthening   during the past eight weeks. Manufacturers reported that the rise in production   which began late last year continued, although orders remain below pre-recession   levels. Contacts in non-residential construction noted some signs of renewed   growth, while residential builders cited only a modest uptick in activity. Sales   figures from auto dealers showed a moderate improvement, whereas District   retailers saw their rate of sales growth slow. Energy production was mixed, and   reports indicate a better-than-expected rise in freight transport volume. Demand   by businesses and consumers for new loans remains weak, while some bankers   commented that the lending environment is starting to grow more competitive.
There was a broad-based pickup in employment in the manufacturing sector,   where businesses are recalling workers and increasing production hours.   Staffing-firm representatives had mixed reports on the number of new job   openings, with opportunities concentrated in the healthcare field. Wage   pressures continue to be contained. Apart from rising prices for steel and   lumber, raw materials and product pricing was generally stable.
A large majority of our contacts told us that their inventories are now well   balanced, reflecting increased demand. Capacity utilization rates continue to   improve, with a few reports indicating that it is now moving toward historical   norms. Capital outlays remain at relatively low levels, and business owners are   approaching spending decisions with caution. However, the number of respondents   who plan on additional spending during the second half of 2010 has increased   substantially since our last report. Several steel producers and service center   representatives reported that they are beginning to see signs of a leveling off   in steel prices. Nonetheless, a few manufacturers are contemplating, or have   already put in place, higher product prices that reflect the rise in the cost of   steel. Even though new hiring is limited, we heard numerous reports of recalling   laid-off workers and increasing work hours. Wage pressures are contained.
Activity in non-residential construction continues to show signs of a pickup.   Inquiries have improved, and many contractors said that their backlogs are   higher than year-ago levels. Most projects currently under-way fall within the   industrial and government-funded infrastructure categories. The glut in retail   space shows no signs of diminishing. Almost all of our contacts are fairly   optimistic in their outlook for the remainder of the year. Increased costs for   construction materials were limited to steel and lumber. General contractors   reported a small amount of seasonal and permanent hiring. While opportunities   for subcontractors are beginning to improve, many of them are still struggling   and taking on projects at cost.
