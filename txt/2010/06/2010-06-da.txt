Business conditions continued to improve in the Eleventh District. Activity   in manufacturing, staffing services, transportation services, housing and energy   grew modestly. Retail sales were flat to slightly down but in line with   retailers' expectations during the reporting period. While outlooks remained   positive, contacts from some industries noted concerns about how the European   debt crisis and recent stock market volatility would affect future business.
Crude oil prices dropped from $85 per barrel in early April to near $70 in   late May. Natural gas prices were flat during the reporting period. Sharp   increases in the price of petrochemicals such as ethylene and propylene seen   earlier are reversing as ethylene plants come back online and refineries   increase utilization rates. Declining prices have spurred export demand for U.S.   petrochemicals and related products.
Some high-tech manufacturers noted slight easing in export demand due to the   European fiscal crisis, while others said orders continued to grow at a   consistently strong pace. Inventories were reported to be under control and one   semiconductor respondent said they were able to increase inventories to desired   levels. Most respondents remain optimistic that demand will be strong over the   next six months but noted that the outlook has become more uncertain due to   fiscal problems in Europe.
Producers of trailers said continued strength in demand has boosted the   outlook over the next three months. Manufacturers of aircrafts and parts said   orders from the commercial and general aviation industry have improved, while   demand for government and military aircraft remains weak. An aircraft repair and   maintenance firm said demand strengthened over the past month, and is expected   to rise further over the next three months.
Reports from paper manufacturers were mixed. Most respondents reported strong   demand while one corrugated box manufacturer noted a decline in orders. Food   producers noted an increase in orders. Inventories are at desired levels but   some food manufacturers said stocking up for certain items has been an issue due   to the recent acceleration in demand.
Petrochemical producers cited improved domestic demand for most products   except for polyvinyl chloride, which is tied to commercial and residential   construction. Demand for oil products is above year-ago levels, and refinery   capacity utilization rates have risen from the low 80 percent range in early   April to the high 80s in late May. Refinery margins have improved and are at   their highest levels for the year.
Automobile dealers said sales ticked up since the last report. Inventories   remain lean. Prices have been inching upwards due to some pullback in incentives   introduced earlier. Contacts expect demand will gradually improve through the   end of the year.
Demand for transportation services was positive suggesting further   improvement in overall economic conditions. Intermodal cargo volumes were flat   over the past month but are slightly up from three months and year-ago levels.   Shipping firms say large freight volumes continued to grow strongly but small   parcel shipping volumes were flat over the reporting period. Railroads reported   a significant and broad-based increase in shipments, and noted that the outlook   is more upbeat than last time. Airlines cited further improvement in demand,   with leisure travel seeing continued growth and business travel recovering.   Contacts say domestic travel is rebounding but is not as strong as international   demand. The outlook is positive as revenues have improved due to fare increases   and advance bookings are holding up well.
Apartment markets continue to fare better than expected, with occupancy and   rents improving in most Texas metros. While concessions are ongoing, contacts   noted they are not as widespread as earlier in the year.
Commercial real estate contacts said that although conditions remain weak,   there are signs that the sector is firming. Leases and property sales have   picked up as rents and prices have come down. Some contacts said there were a   few instances of property prices being "bid up" due to the large amount of   interested buyers versus the low amount of quality properties for sale. Despite   the improvement, the large amount of space available is expected to keep   commercial construction subdued for the remainder of this year.
