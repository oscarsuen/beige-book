The Twelfth District economy posted further modest improvement during the   reporting period of early April through the end of May. Despite rising prices   for some non-oil commodities, price increases for final goods and services   remained restrained, and upward wage pressures were largely absent. Demand for   retail items and services continued to strengthen, but sales remain well below   pre-recession levels. Manufacturing activity in the District continued to firm,   with additional improvement noted in sectors such as wood products and metal   fabrication, which have been among those most troubled. Agricultural producers   reported solid sales, while demand was mixed for providers of natural resource   products. Demand for housing appeared to hold largely steady, but conditions in   commercial real estate weakened further. Banking contacts reported stable to   slightly increased lending activity.
Upward wage pressures were largely absent, although reports continued to   point to notable increases in employee benefit costs. Compensation gains   remained constrained by high unemployment and limited hiring throughout the   District. Compared to the same period a year ago, the majority of respondents   expect wages to remain largely stable or rise slightly in the second half of   2010, while they anticipate that benefit costs, especially for health insurance,   will increase more significantly.
Demand for services showed further signs of improvement but remained weak   overall. Providers of health-care services reported relatively steady levels of   activity, while energy utilities reported increased demand from households and   from firms in selected industries, such as technology and wood products.   Similarly, restaurants and other food-service firms noted continued modest   increases in demand. Sales remained sluggish for providers of professional and   media services. Conditions continued to improve in the tourism and leisure   sector: Contacts in many of the District's major markets reported increases in   visitor volumes and hotel occupancy rates, and, notably, reports pointed to   positive developments in business travel and convention activity.
