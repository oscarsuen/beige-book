Business contacts in the First District report stable to increasing activity   in recent months compared with a year earlier, with most citing increases.   Retail contacts note some potholes in the recovery path, but generally positive   sales results; most responding manufacturers, staffing firms, and software and   information technology services providers are also seeing recent or continued   revenue growth. Home sales and prices are advancing, although contacts attribute   most of the increases to homebuyers' tax credits; commercial real estate markets   are also improving. Some firms are hiring beyond replacement and/or   re-instituting merit-based pay increases. Firms' selling prices are generally   stable. Notwithstanding positive trends, the outlook remains cautious.
Inventory levels are primarily on target, although a few contacts indicate   they are a little higher than expected because of soft sales. Capital spending   is mixed, with some retailers spending on new store openings, remodels, and IT   systems, and others remaining cautious on spending. Headcounts are stable.   Vendor and selling prices are said to be constant, although one contact notes an   increase in food'related commodity prices.
Input costs remain relatively stable at most of the firms contacted, although   costs have edged up a bit at firms whose production processes are highly energy   intensive. In addition, a plastics manufacturer notes that some of its inputs   are in short supply because suppliers ratcheted back capacity during the   downturn and are reluctant to bring it back online. Selling prices are generally   unchanged, as the marketplace remains highly competitive. However, one firm   recently removed discounts it instituted in 2009, and a couple of others   reported being able to implement modest planned price increases.
Employment is mostly stable among contacted manufacturers, although   headcounts remain well below their 2008 levels at a number of firms. A few firms   have hired a small number of workers so far this year and they plan to increase   headcount slightly as the year progresses. The strongest potential employment   gains are in the biopharmaceutical industry where one firm plans to increase its   headcount during 2010 by about 10 percent. Responding firms that froze salaries   last year have generally reinstated merit'based increases or plan to do so by   the middle of the year. Most manufacturers continue to report that their planned   capital expenditures for 2010 are in line or slightly greater than their   expenditures in 2009. Much of the planned capital spending for this year is for   infrastructure'related improvements.
Overall, manufacturers again indicate that they are cautiously optimistic   about the outlook for their business and the economy for the remainder of 2010.   Some express concern about the potential impact of the current situation in   Europe on consumer demand, although most say their exposure to European markets   is relatively limited. Some biopharmaceutical companies expect health care   reform to hurt their bottom lines; one company says the result will be less   money for research and development.
In terms of labor   supply, the skills of job seekers often do not align with the needs of   employers; one contact notes that hundreds of college graduates are looking for   work but available positions often require more experience. Other contacts   indicate that highly skilled candidates are receiving multiple offers; clients,   in turn, are showing more willingness to pay higher rates. In addition, turnover   has recently increased, as those with jobs seem somewhat less reticent to give   them up. Looking forward, First District staffing contacts largely express   increased optimism and predict gradual improvement through 2010.
Contacts in Providence and Boston note that debt default rates for commercial   properties remain significant, and defaults are perceived to be on the rise in   Boston's suburban corridors. The good news, however, is that properties and/or   debt are changing hands as new equity is increasingly willing to invest in   commercial real estate. A commercial real estate lender in Boston confirmed the   influx of equity cash as a welcome development after at least 18 months of   investor skittishness. The same lender is seeing many worthy lending   opportunities in greater Boston and reports facing increasingly stiff   competition from other regional lenders to lower rates and relax loan terms.
The outlook is mixed among respondents around the region. The Providence   contact is more optimistic about both hiring and leasing over the next six to 12   months than a Boston contact, who maintains his prediction that rents have   further to fall. In Hartford, the outlook is largely unchanged, and a Boston   banking contact remains "guardedly optimistic." However, nearly all contacts   point to the recent troubles in Europe as a new source of uncertainty on the   horizon.
April 30 was the deadline to sign a contract on a home in order to be   eligible for the homebuyer tax credits; because June 30 is the associated   deadline to close on the home and contract'signings continued through April,   contacts expect sales numbers to remain strong in May and June. There is no   consensus among respondents about how markets will perform after June, although   some cite anecdotal evidence of continued activity after April 30 and most think   that low interest rates and fairly low prices will continue to make the market   attractive for prospective buyers.
