Contacts in Providence and Boston note that debt default rates for commercial   properties remain significant, and defaults are perceived to be on the rise in   Boston's suburban corridors. The good news, however, is that properties and/or   debt are changing hands as new equity is increasingly willing to invest in   commercial real estate. A commercial real estate lender in Boston confirmed the   influx of equity cash as a welcome development after at least 18 months of   investor skittishness. The same lender is seeing many worthy lending   opportunities in greater Boston and reports facing increasingly stiff   competition from other regional lenders to lower rates and relax loan terms. The outlook is mixed among respondents around the region. The Providence   contact is more optimistic about both hiring and leasing over the next six to 12   months than a Boston contact, who maintains his prediction that rents have   further to fall. In Hartford, the outlook is largely unchanged, and a Boston   banking contact remains "guardedly optimistic." However, nearly all contacts   point to the recent troubles in Europe as a new source of uncertainty on the   horizon. Residential Real Estate Residential real estate markets   in New England experienced large gains in April compared to a year earlier;   contacts attribute much of the improvement to the impending expiration of the   homebuyer tax credits. Home sales increased sharply year-over-year across the   region, ranging from a 26 percent increase in Rhode Island to a 63 percent   increase in Maine. Condo sales increased between 39 percent and 64 percent in   April compared to a year ago. The median price of homes also showed modest   improvement in all markets. The median price of condos in the region also   increased modestly year-over-year in April, except in Rhode Island, where it   fell 15 percent. April 30 was the deadline to sign a contract on a home in order to be   eligible for the homebuyer tax credits; because June 30 is the associated   deadline to close on the home and contract'signings continued through April,   contacts expect sales numbers to remain strong in May and June. There is no   consensus among respondents about how markets will perform after June, although   some cite anecdotal evidence of continued activity after April 30 and most think   that low interest rates and fairly low prices will continue to make the market   attractive for prospective buyers.
