Banking and Finance Banking contacts reported that credit   standards remained stringent but that credit was readily available for borrowers   that met the stricter requirements. Bankers also cited increasing foreclosure   rates, bankruptcies, and loan delinquencies in several markets. Employment and Prices Although overall payroll employment   levels appear to have increased across much of the District, many businesses   still reported that they had a strong preference for increasing the hours for   existing staff and using temporary staff rather than hiring fulltime   employees. District manufacturing and homebuilder contacts cited increases in commodity   prices and transportation costs in April and early May. Several businesses   reported that supply chain capacity constraints were responsible for some of the   price increases. However, little of these cost increases were expected to be   passed on to consumers as lower labor costs continued to relieve pressure on   business balance sheets, and most firms said they faced intense competitive   pressures. Natural Resources and Agriculture Late April's large oil   spill in the Gulf of Mexico has had little immediate impact on District oil   production. However, industry contacts expressed concern about the potential   impact on future production if stricter regulations restrict drilling activity.   Following the spill, supply vessels were able to reach existing rigs without   interruption, and refinery operations were not disrupted significantly. Gulf   Coast crude oil and gasoline stocks remained near the top of their seasonal   average for this time of year. The regional fishing industry reported a   significant reduction in activity, as fears of water contamination and safety   concerns prompting bans on both commercial and recreational fishing in zones   affected by the spill. In early May, severe rainfall flooded parts of central Tennessee. According   to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service's weekly crop survey,   Tennessee farmers reported moderate to severe damages to 39 percent of the   state's corn crop and 21 percent of winter wheat. Damages to fruit and vegetable   crops and nursery stock have also been reported, as well as significant   destruction of farm infrastructure. Elsewhere in the District, recent rains   generally improved soil moisture conditions and crop production.
