On balance, Sixth District business conditions appear to have improved   modestly in April and May. Most retail contacts continued to experience   increased traffic and sales, and their outlook remained generally optimistic.   Reports on tourism were also generally positive; however, considerable   uncertainty was expressed about the potential impact from the Gulf oil spill and   the recent floods in Tennessee. Overall, homebuilder and Realtor reports   suggested that the pace of new and existing home sales slowed somewhat, whereas   commercial construction contacts reported ongoing weak conditions. The   District's manufacturing and transportation segments extended their previous   gains in new orders and production. By most accounts, bank credit conditions   remained tight. Firms across several sectors reported increasing hours worked of   existing staff and expanded the utilization of temporary hires. However, firms   generally remained reluctant to add permanent staff. According to manufacturers   and homebuilders, transportation and material costs rose slightly, but they did   not plan to pass these increases along to customers.
The tourism sector continued to improve. Hospitality contacts in Atlanta,   Miami, Nashville, New Orleans, Orlando, and Tampa all noted hotel occupancy   rates above the national average. Business-related travel and convention   bookings were up and future bookings looked strong. Convention hotel contacts   began noting some pricing power. Cruise-line bookings were gradually trending up   and many were able to increase prices slightly. Similarly, contacts in the   restaurant industry experienced a modest increase in activity and projections   for the near-term were optimistic.
However, the recent Gulf oil spill and the floods in Tennessee have tempered   the outlook in those areas. Contacts indicated that the potential impact on the   tourism industry along the coastline of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and   western Florida could be substantial. In some cases, vacation lodging   cancellations have been replaced by bookings from clean-up crews, laborers, and   the National Guard. The Nashville area is expected to see a decline in   tourism-related receipts because of damage to several tourist venues there. The   near-term outlook among hospitality contacts varied greatly, reflecting the high   level of uncertainty.
Realtors indicated another modest improvement in existing home sales in April   compared with a year earlier. However, on a month-over-month basis, responses   from contacts showed that sales softened slightly. Realtors reported that   high-end home sales exceeded their year-earlier level for the first time since   early 2006. Inventory levels were described as similar to a year earlier, and   home prices stabilized. The outlook for sales over the next several months   remained positive but was a little less upbeat than recent reports.
The   majority of commercial contacts reported that the pace of development was still   well below year-earlier levels and construction backlogs were down sharply. Most   noted that limited access to financing and weak demand continued to constrain   activity. The outlook for commercial construction activity for the rest of the   year remained weak.
District manufacturing and homebuilder contacts cited increases in commodity   prices and transportation costs in April and early May. Several businesses   reported that supply chain capacity constraints were responsible for some of the   price increases. However, little of these cost increases were expected to be   passed on to consumers as lower labor costs continued to relieve pressure on   business balance sheets, and most firms said they faced intense competitive   pressures.
In early May, severe rainfall flooded parts of central Tennessee. According   to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service's weekly crop survey,   Tennessee farmers reported moderate to severe damages to 39 percent of the   state's corn crop and 21 percent of winter wheat. Damages to fruit and vegetable   crops and nursery stock have also been reported, as well as significant   destruction of farm infrastructure. Elsewhere in the District, recent rains   generally improved soil moisture conditions and crop production.
