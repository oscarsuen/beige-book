Economic activity has advanced modestly in the Third District since the last   Beige Book. Manufacturers, on balance, reported increases in shipments and new   orders. Retailers posted sales increases from April to May. Motor vehicle   dealers also indicated that sales increased. Third District banks reported   mostly steady loan volume outstanding. Residential real estate agents and   homebuilders said home sales increased from March to April but slowed in May.   Contacts in the commercial real estate sector said leasing has picked up, but   vacancy rates have not improved, and construction activity continued to be weak.   Service-sector companies generally reported slight gains in activity. Business   firms in the region indicated that prices of most goods and services have been   steady, although there were increased reports of rising prices for basic   materials, construction-related products, and shipping.
The outlook among Third District business contacts is positive but cautious,   overall. Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next   six months, on balance. Retailers expect sales to expand modestly as long as   overall economic conditions and the employment situation improve. Auto dealers   expect the sales rate to increase somewhat in the months ahead. Bankers expect a   slight increase in lending, mostly in commercial and industrial loans.   Residential real estate contacts expect the pace of home sales to ease following   the end of the federal tax credit for purchases. Contacts in nonresidential real   estate expect leasing to increase slowly, but they do not expect any near-term   gains in construction activity. Service-sector companies expect continued modest   growth for the rest of the year.
Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance, and the margin of positive opinions over negative   opinions has been practically unchanged since the previous Beige Book. Among the   firms surveyed in May, about half expect increases in new orders and shipments;   a bit over one-tenth expect decreases. Capital spending plans among area   manufacturers remain positive, on balance, but not strong. About one-fourth of   the firms polled in May plan to increase expenditures for new plant and   equipment, but one-half plan to maintain level spending, and nearly one-fifth   expect to reduce spending.
Third District auto dealers reported a rise in sales in May compared with   April and with May of last year. They said a shortage of popular models has   limited the advance in sales, but they expect manufacturers to increase   production soon. Dealers expect sales to continue to move up through the rest of   the year.
Looking ahead, Third District bankers expect modest loan growth. They   generally expect gains in business lending. In contrast, several bankers said   they expect a falloff in demand for residential mortgages and continued softness   in consumer loan demand. "Individuals are still deleveraging and looking to   build up cash reserves," one banker said.
Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that vacancy rates in commercial   and industrial buildings have increased slightly in most parts of the Third   District in the past few months. Leasing activity has picked up somewhat, but   effective rents have been steady to down as recently completed buildings have   added to the supply of available space. Construction activity has been generally   flat at low levels, according to contacts, although some reported increases in   road building and publicly funded projects. Contacts expect leasing activity to   increase slowly in the months ahead and rents to remain about steady. "It will   not be a robust recovery," according to one contact whose opinion reflected the   consensus. Building contractors and commercial real estate agents were in   agreement that construction activity showed no signs of increasing in the near   term.
Business firms in the region reported a slight increase in hiring, on   balance, but no significant changes in wages since the last Beige Book. Several   firms noted that recent increases in business activity have prompted them to   consider increasing staffing levels sometime this year. Employment agencies   reported strengthening demand for temporary workers and a slight increase in   demand for permanent employees.
