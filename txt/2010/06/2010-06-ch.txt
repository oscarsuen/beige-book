Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to improve, but the rate   of improvement slowed from April to May. Manufacturing continued to lead the   way, and consumer and business spending also increased further. Construction   activity improved slightly on the basis of increases in residential and public   building. However, the gains in all of these sectors in May were somewhat slower   than in April. Price pressures remained limited. Crop conditions were slightly   better than normal for this time of year.
