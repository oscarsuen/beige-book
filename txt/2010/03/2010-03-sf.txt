Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to increase modestly during the reporting period of early January through late February.  Upward pressures on prices and wages remained quite limited.  Sales of retail items and services generally stayed at low levels, but both showed some improvement.  Manufacturing activity was mixed but appeared to pick up further on balance.  Sales continued to expand for agricultural producers, while demand for energy resources fell.  Home demand appeared to be little changed from the previous period, but demand for commercial real estate continued to slide.  Contacts from financial institutions reported that loan demand was largely unchanged and credit standards remained tight.
Contacts in most sectors characterized wages as essentially flat, although some businesses reported significant increases in the costs of employee benefits, especially for health insurance.  Upward wage pressures were limited by high unemployment and restricted hiring in most sectors and regions.  An overwhelming majority of respondents expect no change in their firm's employment counts for at least the first half of the year, and they expect limited hiring to hold down wage pressures going forward.
Demand for services continued to be weak overall but showed signs of improvement since the last reporting period.  Sales remained sluggish for providers of professional and media services, although scattered increases in demand were noted for some categories.  Similarly, restaurants and other food-service firms stated that they are slowly seeing signs of recovery in demand.  Providers of health-care services reported an increase in patient volumes.  Conditions remained challenging for businesses in the tourism and leisure sector, although further signs of improvement were reported:  contacts in Southern California and Seattle noted that hotel occupancy rates appear to have stabilized, while contacts in Hawaii and Las Vegas noted ongoing increases in visitor volumes.
