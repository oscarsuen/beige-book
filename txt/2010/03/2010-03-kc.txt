The Tenth District economy showed further signs of modest growth in January and February.  However, some unexpected weakness was noted in several sectors of the District economy due to bad weather.  Consumer spending was flat compared to year ago levels with continued softness in auto sales.  Manufacturing activity expanded but did not translate into additional factory hiring.  Residential real estate markets continued to benefit from tax credits, while commercial real estate weakened further.  District banks reported continued weak loan demand.  Energy firms expanded drilling activity, especially for natural gas.  In agriculture, growing conditions remained favorable for crops, while profit margins improved for livestock producers.  Despite higher input prices, retail prices remained unchanged and little evidence of wage pressures was reported in District labor markets.
