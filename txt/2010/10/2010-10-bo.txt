Economic activity continues to exceed year-earlier levels according to most   business contacts in the First District. Retailers cite somewhat more positive   results than they did six weeks ago. Manufacturers report continued growth,   although some at a slower pace recently than in the first half of the year.   Consulting industry contacts also indicate sales are higher than a year ago.   Commercial real estate markets remain in the doldrums, while sales of   residential properties remain below year-earlier levels, as they have since the   expiration of homebuyer tax credits. Hiring among retail, manufacturing, and   consulting firms remains limited and these contacts expect continued growth,   albeit at a modest pace. Indeed, across all sectors, the outlook appears to be   "more of the same."
Inventory levels are in line with expectations and capital spending is   generally on target. Headcounts are either stable or growing modestly, with most   increases attributed to new store growth. One respondent notes significant cost   increases for food commodities, particularly dairy, nuts, and bacon. The   majority of contacts believe the recovery will be slow and steady, and even   those retailers reporting sales increases characterize themselves as cautiously   optimistic.
Inventory levels at most contacted firms remain low, and a few are trying to   bring their inventories down further. Many respondents reduced inventories in   response to the economic turmoil in 2008 and 2009 and plan to maintain low   inventories and lean operations going forward to improve profitability. In   contrast, one semiconductor firm has a large backlog of orders and is struggling   to keep up with demand from the auto industry. A few firms are facing pricing   pressures from rising input costs. In particular, the cost of steel and copper   continue to rise as does the cost of wheat, which is used by a food products   manufacturer. One responding firm increased prices modestly earlier in the year   and anticipates having to raise prices another 1 percent to 3 percent between   now and the first quarter of next year to cover rising steel costs. Other   companies facing price pressures have strategically increased prices for some of   their products and have met little resistance.
Hiring continues to be limited amongst contacted manufacturing firms; the few   companies noticeably increasing headcount are doing so overseas. Several   companies are hiring to replace workers lost to attrition or retirement, but   nearly all respondents are maintaining their existing U.S. headcounts. These   firms say they do not plan to do any substantial hiring until the demand   environment noticeably improves and current levels of economic and fiscal   uncertainty subside.
Capital spending plans at most manufacturers remain moderate. Most contacted   firms continue to report that capital expenditures are in line with plans; none   anticipates any big changes in capital spending heading into 2011, although   nearly all report that their current financial position and ability to invest   are excellent.
Overall, the firms contacted are slightly less optimistic about growth in   2011 than in the last few conversations. This softer outlook reflects both the   recent softening of demand relative to earlier in 2010 and continued uncertainty   surrounding consumer demand and the regulatory and tax environments.
Prices are stable for most consulting contacts, with the exception of one   firm that raised prices 5 percent. While not raising list prices, contacts have   been able to eliminate discounts they offered to maintain business throughout   2008 and 2009. While most consulting respondents are only replacing workers   leaving through natural attrition, some added a small number of new employees,   increasing headcounts by 5 percent to 10 percent; one firm, by contrast, expects   to downsize slightly next year.
Based on improved demand seen in September and early October, all the   consulting contacts are optimistic about the last quarter of 2010 as well as   about next year's performance. Most expect about 10 percent annual growth for   2011.
In positive news from the sales market, Boston's Hancock Tower sold recently   at a markup of 40 percent over its foreclosure auction price in March 2009. In   contrast, a downtown Boston office building with high vacancies is being sold   for less than half of its 2007 price. Despite uneven performance and limited   volume in the big-ticket property market, a Boston-based bank that targets   smaller-ticket properties is having one of its best years ever in terms of   commercial real estate loans booked, although most of its lending activity   involves refinancing rather than new acquisitions. The bank also reports that a   previously non-performing retail-property loan resumed payment.
Boston contacts do not expect significant commercial real estate improvements   in the near future unless the labor market heats up considerably. A Providence   contact is optimistic that leasing volume will hold up in the coming months, but   also noted some risks on the horizon. A Portland contact expects his firm's   brokerage volume to improve in 2011 over 2010 and sees potential expansion in   some (but not all) sectors of Portland's economy.
Pending sales figures for Massachusetts suggest that September's final sales   will also be below a year ago. Contacts around the region forecast flat sales or   continued year-over-year declines for the rest of 2010. As of August, all six   New England states report year-to-date home sales above last year, but most   contacts expect that by the end of the year the total number of sales will be   about even with 2009.
