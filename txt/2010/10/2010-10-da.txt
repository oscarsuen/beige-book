The Eleventh District economy expanded at a more subdued pace over the past   six weeks than during the previous reporting period. The energy, transportation   services and staffing industries which have been a source of strength in the   recovery, saw positive but slower growth. Business activity was unchanged in   most other industries, although retailers said sales improved and financial   firms said lending activity picked up slightly. Demand continued to be strong   for petrochemical products, and agricultural conditions remained favorable.   Firms' outlooks are positive, but contacts say uncertainty about economic   growth, regulatory reform and public policy has introduced more caution.
Selling prices held steady at most responding   firms, but there were some reports of increases. Small parcel shipping prices   rose slightly while large parcel shipping prices increased sharply, according to   contacts. Prices for some petrochemicals rose during the reporting period, and   agricultural respondents said commodity prices increased across the board. Food   producers were considering price increases because of rising costs for dairy and   sugar, and retailers noted higher costs for cotton, corn, wheat, milk and   cheese.
After holding steady in a tight range between $74 and $76 dollars per barrel   for most of the reporting period, the price of crude oil rose to over $80 in   early October on stronger demand from China and a weaker dollar. Retail gasoline   and diesel prices held steady since the last report, and natural gas prices   remain under $4 per Mcf.
Most responding firms reported steady   employment levels, and some noted slight hiring activity. Contacts in the   airline, primary metals, transportation manufacturing and auto sales industries   said they had added workers. Staffing firms reported slower growth in demand for   their services, although contacts said direct hire fees for IT and professional   workers had risen. Minor layoffs were reported by some construction-related   manufacturers and one legal firm. Wage pressures were minimal, although higher   wages were reported by airlines and some shipping and transportation   manufacturing firms.
Most construction-related producers,   including cement, lumber and fabricated metals firms, said orders remained flat   over the past six weeks. Contacts believe soft demand is related to uncertainty   about the economic and political environment. One glass contact said sales rose   due to a pickup in apartment construction. Primary metals producers noted a   slight uptick in business. Some contacts are selling to new markets, such as   solar panel production. Others indicated that remodeling activity had boosted   sales. Despite the increase, contacts believe the industry has a long road   ahead.
Manufacturers of high-tech products said that sales and orders were growing   at the same or slightly slower pace since the last report. Most respondents said   inventories are below or at desired levels. Sales are expected to continue to   grow at a moderate pace over the next six months, but there was increased   uncertainty in respondents' outlooks.
Paper manufactures said orders were slightly down, in part because customers   were managing inventories more tightly. Contacts expect sales growth to be   anemic through year-end. Food producers said demand growth held steady. Sales   growth of premium items had picked up, but orders for value items weakened. Most   transportation manufacturers noted steady demand.
Petrochemical producers noted strong domestic demand for most products.   Export growth continued to slow, reflecting higher prices, although there were   reports of renewed Chinese interest in some products. Domestic orders for PVC   used in commercial construction were weak, but exports were stronger, according   to contacts. Refiners said conditions continued to weaken. Both margins and   operating rates fell since the last report, and gasoline and distillate   inventories have risen against seasonal expectations.
Back-to-school spending led to a pickup in sales   over the reporting period, however customers remain extremely price conscious.   Consumers continue to focus on non-discretionary goods, but contacts noted there   was an uptick in spending on medium-priced household goods. Eleventh District   sales trended roughly in line with the nation during the reporting period.   Contacts expressed caution in their outlooks and said competition remains   fierce.
Automobile sales were steady after accounting for seasonality. Inventories   are a little tight, notably for large SUVs. Used car prices have risen,   reflecting elevated demand and short supply. Expectations are for continued slow   growth in sales.
Staffing firms reported stagnant demand over the   reporting period. Business is still at good levels, but contacts say firms are   eliminating some previous positions or finding other ways to fill vacant jobs.   Despite the slowdown, contacts report that demand is coming from a wide-range of   industries, including light industrial, manufacturing, IT, and call centers.   Clerical workers remain in high demand. Near-term outlooks remain optimistic,   but contacts are more uncertain about the longer term.
Accounting firms said business had improved modestly, as more merger and   acquisition work has materialized since the last report. Contacts also noted a   pickup in financial consulting and tax-related work going into the fall season.   Demand for legal services remains soft. The only area of activity is mergers and   acquisitions. Legal and accounting firms say they are in a better position than   last year, but they remain cautious in their outlooks.
Transportation services demand was positive, but the pace was somewhat slower   over the past six weeks. Contacts said intermodal cargo volumes increased   minimally, but that the increases were broad based across industries. Railroad   contacts noted moderate gains in volumes overall, although shipments of grain,   non-metallic minerals, chemicals and petroleum products increased at a strong   pace. International container trade volumes flattened over the past month, but   are up from a year ago. Firms that ship small parcel goods said volumes dipped   in September after several months of positive growth. Airline traffic was steady   to slightly down seasonally over the past six weeks. Contacts noted that   conditions are much better than a year ago, thanks in part to stronger business   travel. Transportation service respondents said uncertainty was adding caution   to their outlooks. Most expect stable conditions in the near term, with a modest   pickup in activity next year.
New home sales stabilized   somewhat after a significant drop off following the expiration of the homebuyer   tax credit. Entry-level builders have pulled back on starts considerably after   the run-up earlier in the year, but contacts say builders in higher price points   are seeing some successful sales. Rising buyer cancellations were cited as a   problem, however. Contacts in the new and existing home sector said demand will   likely remain subdued in the near term because of tighter credit standards and   uncertainty about changes in tax policy. Contacts said this uncertainty has led   more potential buyers to rent, which has led to strong apartment leasing   activity.
Commercial construction remains at very low levels. There is no speculative   construction occurring, but hospital and education projects are keeping some   contractors busy. Office and industrial leasing activity appears to have picked   up. Contacts said very low rents were inducing firms to make new deals. Contacts   said property sales continue to rise from very low levels, and investor interest   remains high, especially for distressed sales.
Financial firms reported some pickup   in lending activity. Consumer loan demand rose substantially, in large part due   to growth in auto loans. Home mortgage activity picked up slightly as well.   Despite high mortgage delinquencies contacts said they are not concerned with   outstanding credit quality overall. Financial contacts noted increased pressure   to price loans more aggressively and some have even begun altering loan   structure somewhat, although overall underwriting standards remain very strict.   Larger banks are reportedly seeing stronger loan demand than regional and   community banks. There were reports of smaller banks passing up good   owner-occupied real estate deals because of stricter enforcement of regulatory   guidelines on commercial real estate.
Drilling activity rose at a slower pace over the   past six weeks, in part due to a decline in natural gas-directed activity. The   U.S. rig count edged up by 8 rigs and 41 percent of U.S. activity is now   directed to oil. Eleventh District rig activity dipped slightly although   contacts said drilling continues to increase in Texas' Permian Basin. Drilling   services companies said business remains strong. Outlooks were optimistic,   assuming a soft landing for the natural gas drilling industry. Contacts noted   strong domestic land-based drilling and improved international demand has   cushioned losses sustained in the Gulf of Mexico.
Overall agricultural conditions in the   District remain very positive. Tropical storm Hermine brought substantial   rainfall to Texas in early September, improving soil moisture in most parts of   the state but causing flood damage in some areas. Above-average growing   conditions resulted in good yields, and moisture conditions are favorable going   into fall planting. Demand for U.S. agricultural products remains strong and   commodity prices have gone up across the board, boosting optimism among   producers. Cotton will be a boon for Texas agriculture this year, as a   potentially record-setting crop is matched with near record-high market   prices.
