The Eleventh District economy expanded at a more subdued pace over the past   six weeks than during the previous reporting period. The energy, transportation   services and staffing industries which have been a source of strength in the   recovery, saw positive but slower growth. Business activity was unchanged in   most other industries, although retailers said sales improved and financial   firms said lending activity picked up slightly. Demand continued to be strong   for petrochemical products, and agricultural conditions remained favorable.   Firms' outlooks are positive, but contacts say uncertainty about economic   growth, regulatory reform and public policy has introduced more caution.
After holding steady in a tight range between $74 and $76 dollars per barrel   for most of the reporting period, the price of crude oil rose to over $80 in   early October on stronger demand from China and a weaker dollar. Retail gasoline   and diesel prices held steady since the last report, and natural gas prices   remain under $4 per Mcf.
Manufacturers of high-tech products said that sales and orders were growing   at the same or slightly slower pace since the last report. Most respondents said   inventories are below or at desired levels. Sales are expected to continue to   grow at a moderate pace over the next six months, but there was increased   uncertainty in respondents' outlooks.
Paper manufactures said orders were slightly down, in part because customers   were managing inventories more tightly. Contacts expect sales growth to be   anemic through year-end. Food producers said demand growth held steady. Sales   growth of premium items had picked up, but orders for value items weakened. Most   transportation manufacturers noted steady demand.
Petrochemical producers noted strong domestic demand for most products.   Export growth continued to slow, reflecting higher prices, although there were   reports of renewed Chinese interest in some products. Domestic orders for PVC   used in commercial construction were weak, but exports were stronger, according   to contacts. Refiners said conditions continued to weaken. Both margins and   operating rates fell since the last report, and gasoline and distillate   inventories have risen against seasonal expectations.
Automobile sales were steady after accounting for seasonality. Inventories   are a little tight, notably for large SUVs. Used car prices have risen,   reflecting elevated demand and short supply. Expectations are for continued slow   growth in sales.
Accounting firms said business had improved modestly, as more merger and   acquisition work has materialized since the last report. Contacts also noted a   pickup in financial consulting and tax-related work going into the fall season.   Demand for legal services remains soft. The only area of activity is mergers and   acquisitions. Legal and accounting firms say they are in a better position than   last year, but they remain cautious in their outlooks.
Transportation services demand was positive, but the pace was somewhat slower   over the past six weeks. Contacts said intermodal cargo volumes increased   minimally, but that the increases were broad based across industries. Railroad   contacts noted moderate gains in volumes overall, although shipments of grain,   non-metallic minerals, chemicals and petroleum products increased at a strong   pace. International container trade volumes flattened over the past month, but   are up from a year ago. Firms that ship small parcel goods said volumes dipped   in September after several months of positive growth. Airline traffic was steady   to slightly down seasonally over the past six weeks. Contacts noted that   conditions are much better than a year ago, thanks in part to stronger business   travel. Transportation service respondents said uncertainty was adding caution   to their outlooks. Most expect stable conditions in the near term, with a modest   pickup in activity next year.
Commercial construction remains at very low levels. There is no speculative   construction occurring, but hospital and education projects are keeping some   contractors busy. Office and industrial leasing activity appears to have picked   up. Contacts said very low rents were inducing firms to make new deals. Contacts   said property sales continue to rise from very low levels, and investor interest   remains high, especially for distressed sales.
