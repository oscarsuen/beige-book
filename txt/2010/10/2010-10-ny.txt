The Second District's economy continued to expand at a modest pace since the   last report. Input prices have risen somewhat, while consumer prices remain   steady. General merchandise retailers report that sales were mixed but, on   balance, steady and close to plan; auto dealers in upstate New York report that   sales held up fairly well in August and September and that credit conditions   continued to improve. Commercial real estate markets have generally been steady   since the last report. Residential real estate sales markets were generally   stable across the District, while New York City's rental market showed continued   modest improvement. Manufacturing-sector contacts report some pickup in business   during September and early October, after a pause in August. Tourism activity in   New York City, though still fairly brisk, has shown some signs of cooling since   the last report. The labor market has been mixed recently: manufacturers   continue to add jobs and firms in a wide variety of industries plan to increase   employment in the months ahead; however, contacts in New York City report that   the financial industry continues to shed jobs and that hiring for office and   administrative jobs generally remains sluggish. Finally, bankers report little   change in loan demand, lower delinquency rates on consumer loans, and ongoing   tightening in credit standards.
Tourism activity in New York City, though still fairly brisk, has shown some   signs of cooling since the last report. Manhattan hotels report that occupancy   rates remained close to 90 percent in September, while room rates continued to   run 10-15 percent ahead of a year earlier. However, there are scattered reports   of weaker than expected advance bookings for October, which may reflect some   softening in business travel. Broadway theaters report that revenue weakened   noticeably in September and was down roughly 10 percent from a year earlier;   this reflects some recent tapering off in both attendance and ticket prices, the   latter of which was down roughly 6 percent from a year earlier.
Separately, consumer confidence remained steady in September, though at   depressed levels. The Conference Board reports that confidence among residents   of the Middle Atlantic region (NY, NJ, PA) edged up in September, after falling   to a more than one-year low in August; Siena College's September survey of New   York State residents shows confidence holding steady in both upstate and   downstate--also at weak levels.
Office markets across the District softened modestly since the last report.   Asking rents continued to drift down in Manhattan and northern New Jersey but   were mostly steady in other parts of the region. In Manhattan, office vacancy   rates retreated in August and September, after rising in July. In most of the   District, though, vacancy rates have edged up since the last report.
Manufacturing firms in the District report a pickup in activity in September,   following a pause in July and August, and a growing proportion of manufacturing   contacts indicate that they are increasing employment and plan to add more   workers in the months ahead. Non-manufacturing contacts also report some pickup   in business activity and have grown substantially more optimistic about the   general business outlook. Both manufacturers and other firms report a moderate   increase in input price pressures but only modest changes in selling prices.
