Economic activity in the Eighth District has expanded modestly since our   previous report. Manufacturing activity increased, on balance, as did activity   in the services sector. Residential real estate market conditions were mixed.   Although commercial and industrial real estate market conditions remained soft,   there were reports of increased activity in some areas. Overall lending activity   at a sample of small and mid-sized banks in the District declined in the   three-month period from mid-June to mid-September.
The District's services sector has also continued to improve since our   previous report. Firms in the restaurant, automotive repair, air transportation   support, and social services industries opened new facilities in the District   and hired new employees. In contrast, contacts in the business support services,   hotel, and gambling industries reported plans to decrease operations and lay off   workers. Sales of new automobiles were down compared with the same time last   year, while used automobiles have shown stronger sales. General retail contacts   reported that sales were flat over the reporting period.
Activity in commercial real estate and construction remained slow throughout   most of the District. Contacts in Louisville reported that the office market   remained soft and there is low demand for commercial real estate loans. While a   contact in central Arkansas reported some improvement in commercial property   sales, a contact in northeast Arkansas noted that commercial construction   remains at a virtual standstill. Industrial real estate and construction was   mixed throughout the District, with some regions showing signs of improvement. A   contact in west Tennessee noted industrial development projects that are   expected to aid business activity in the area. A contact in Evansville, Indiana,   reported that there seems to be more "quoting" on major construction, but no   real jobs are starting. In contrast, contacts in the west Kentucky region   reported construction projects primarily related to health and hospitality.   Contacts in St. Louis noted limited industrial construction projects.
