Feedback on economic activity in the Fifth District continued to be mixed   since our last report. Activity at retail and services firms was, on balance,   flat to down. Manufacturing activity also edged down over the last month, while   port contacts gave mixed reports. Both residential and commercial real estate   activity was mostly unchanged from the weak levels of the recent past, and   several contacts stated that property values had stabilized. Activity in the   banking sector improved modestly, however, led by gains in business lending and   home refinancing. Tourism continued to strengthen in the District, with bookings   increasing over the last month. Reports on labor markets varied, with permanent   hiring flat to down and temporary employment picking up slightly. Price and wage   growth in the services and manufacturing sectors remained subdued since our last   report.
Port activity in the District over the last three months was mixed, with   imports generally outperforming exports. Several port officials stated that   imports at their facilities were up slightly in recent months, but exports had,   at best, stabilized over the last few months. However, exports of commodities   were up, according to one port authority, partly due to increased grain   shipments to Russia and Pakistan. Several sources stated that the peak season   had come and gone, with businesses ordering earlier than in past years and now   becoming cautious about building inventory until they have a better sense of   underlying demand over the remainder of the year. Some softness in shipping   rates was noted at several ports, but one shipper reported that utilization   rates of both ships and containers were "getting back to full capacity."
Commercial real estate activity continued to be quite weak throughout most of   the District since our last report, with most contacts reporting difficulty in   obtaining loans for new projects. Several commercial Realtors indicated that   financing was not only difficult, but also applications took an exceptionally   long time to be processed. Moreover, local companies needed to be well funded to   get loan approvals from banks. A Realtor in Central Virginia stated that both   local and nationally based companies were less confident about expanding than   they were a month ago. Leasing rates remained on a downward trend, according to   several Realtors, with some firms trying to take advantage of lower rates to   upgrade their office or retail location. In contrast to most other areas, the   D.C. area showed signs of improvement, with one Realtor noting a pickup in   office leasing activity. Another Realtor in that area reported that retailers   were cautiously revisiting development plans that had been abandoned a year   ago.
