Reports from Sixth District business contacts indicated that the pace of   economic activity remained slow in September. Retailers noted a decrease in   traffic and sales. The hospitality sector improved, although some areas   continued to be affected by the lingering impact of the Gulf oil spill. Realtors   and homebuilders cited further weakening in home sales and increasing   inventories, while the pace of nonresidential construction was soft.   Manufacturers reported that new orders grew at a slower pace and production was   flat. Provision of bank credit continued to be constrained and loan demand   remained weak. District labor markets continued to recover slowly, although many   businesses relied on increased hours for existing staff and expanded their use   of temporary hires rather than adding permanent employees. Some transportation   and material prices rose slightly, but firms continued to report limited pass   through to consumers.
Tourism activity across much of the District improved and the outlook for the   remainder of the year was positive. Cruise bookings and pricing increased and   contacts reported that discretionary spending on board rose. The impact of   summer cancelations continued to be felt in many Gulf Coast destinations.   However, the losses experienced in these areas have been largely offset by an   increase in activity in Northeast Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee.
Nonresidential construction activity remained soft across the District.   Contractors noted that the pace of commercial development was below the   year-earlier level and backlogs remained low. Contacts continued to report high   vacancy rates and downward pressures on rents. The outlook for the rest of the   year remained negative.
District contacts reported that firms were resisting passing higher input   costs through to consumers given the ongoing softness in sales. As a result,   margins remained very thin. A number of manufacturers indicated that rising   costs of materials and employee benefits were likely to be passed on to   customers over the next 12 months.
District crops were troubled by high temperatures and dry weather in   September that resulted in early harvesting. Soil moisture levels were reported   as extremely low in areas of Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Regional   cotton plantings were much higher than a year earlier.
