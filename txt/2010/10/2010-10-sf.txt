Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to post further modest   growth during the reporting period of September through early October, although   conditions in many sectors remained weak. Price increases for final goods and   services were quite limited, and upward pressures on wages were virtually   nonexistent. Demand for retail items and services continued to strengthen   somewhat, but sales remained lackluster overall. Manufacturing activity in the   District firmed a bit further on balance. Sales were robust for agricultural   products, while demand was largely stable for energy resources. Activity in   District housing markets remained sluggish, and demand for commercial real   estate stayed weak. Contacts from financial institutions reported largely stable   lending activity.
Upward wage pressures were largely absent, although reports pointed to   further increases in the costs of employee benefits, particularly health care.   High unemployment and limited demand for new employees held down compensation   gains in most regions and sectors. Contacts in most sectors expect that ongoing   productivity gains and cost efficiencies will largely offset the need for   staffing increases in the near term. However, a few contacts noted that some   firms have reached the limits of productivity gains from current staff and will   need to add workers as product demand improves.
Demand for services continued to improve modestly. Sales grew for providers   of technology services, spurred in part by business investments to enhance   production efficiency. Contacts in the restaurant and food services industry   noted continued slight gains in activity. Demand for professional, media, and   entertainment services held largely steady overall. Providers of energy services   reported increased deliveries to businesses and households, and activity picked   up somewhat for providers of trucking services. Conditions in the District's   travel and tourism sector improved further. Visitor volumes and hotel occupancy   rates rose in several of the District's major markets, spurred largely by   significant growth in business travel and convention activity.
