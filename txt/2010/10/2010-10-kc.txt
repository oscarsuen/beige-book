The Tenth District economy posted moderate but uneven growth in the September   reporting period. Restaurants, hotels, and general retailers reported a rebound   in activity but auto sales remained soft. Manufacturing activity rebounded but   did not translate into additional factory hiring. Residential and commercial   real estate markets weakened further. District banks reported stable banking   conditions overall with some deterioration in loan quality. Continued expansion   in the energy sector supported increased hiring and capital spending. In   agriculture, favorable crop growing conditions and attractive profit margins   spurred capital spending and land price gains. Despite higher input prices,   selling prices in most retail sectors remained unchanged, and little evidence of   wage pressures was reported in District labor markets.
