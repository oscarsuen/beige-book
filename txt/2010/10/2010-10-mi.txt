Since the last report, economic growth in the Ninth District has picked up   somewhat. Consumer spending, tourism, services, manufacturing, energy, and   mining saw increases. Activity in the commercial and residential real estate   sectors decreased, while commercial construction remained weak. Meanwhile,   residential construction was mixed and progress in the agriculture sector   slowed. Labor markets showed some signs of picking up; however, overall weakness   continued. Wage increases were moderate, and overall prices remained relatively   level.
Tourism activity was up from a year ago. Rooms sold at Montana hotels were up   almost 11 percent in August from a year earlier, according to a state tourism   research organization. A tourism official in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan   noted that the summer season finished well ahead of a year ago and that fall   traffic seems to be holding up. Minnesota lodging and campground operators noted   increases in summer business from a year earlier and were more optimistic for   fall tourism than a year ago, according to the results of a state survey. In   addition, attendance at the Minnesota State Fair almost reached last year's   record high.
Commercial real estate remained weak. In Minneapolis-St. Paul, about 20   percent of office space and 8 percent of retail space sat vacant in August. A   commercial real estate broker in Fargo, N.D., said activity there was flat at   low levels. Residential construction showed signs of stagnation. August closed   home sales in Minneapolis-St. Paul fell almost 9 percent from a year earlier   while prices decreased nearly 2 percent. In contrast, residential real estate   contacts in Bismarck, N.D., described market activity there as busy.
Wage increases remained modest. For example, a county government in the   Minneapolis-St. Paul area will award most nonunion employees a 1 percent raise.
Overall prices remained level. Minnesota gasoline prices were relatively   stable since the last report. Residential natural gas prices were only about 5   percent higher than a year ago. However, scrap metal and plastic resin prices   increased since the last report.
