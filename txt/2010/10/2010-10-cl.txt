On balance, economic activity in the Fourth District held steady during the   past six weeks. Manufacturers reported that new orders and production rose   modestly. An uptick in residential construction, retail sales, and new car   buying that began in mid-summer has tapered off. Nonresidential building   activity showed little change. Reports from energy companies indicated stable   production, while freight carriers saw a small decline in volume. Demand for   business loans showed some signs of a pickup, and consumer borrowing remained   weak. New hiring continues at a slower pace than seen earlier in the year. There   were scattered reports of increased payrolls in manufacturing, energy, and   banking. Overall, staffing-firm representatives noted that the number of new job   openings declined slightly, with available openings concentrated in healthcare   and professional business services. Wage pressures continue to be contained.   Apart from volatility in steel and commodity prices, raw materials and product   pricing were fairly steady. Manufacturing Reports from District factories showed that   new orders and production rose modestly during the past six weeks. Production   was also higher on a year-over-year basis, with many contacts experiencing   double-digit increases. Several manufacturers commented that opportunities are   growing faster in offshore markets than domestically. Almost all of our   respondents expect business activity to follow current seasonal trends for the   near term. Most steel producers and service centers reported that volume was   either flat or trending up. Shipments are being driven by energy-related, auto,   and heavy equipment industries. Two contacts noted that exports are gaining   strength. All of our steel contacts expect little change in business activity in   the near term. District auto production showed a large increase during August on   a month-over-month basis, due to production starts on the 2011 models. In terms   of year-over-year comparisons, production was little changed for both domestic   and foreign nameplates. Capacity utilization is slowly rising for several manufacturers and steel   producers, but it continues below pre-recession levels across the board.   Inventories are balanced with incoming orders. Capital outlays remain at   relatively low levels, with many of our contacts reporting that they have   postponed starting projects until they are certain of a sustainable recovery.   Other than volatility in steel and commodity prices, the cost of raw materials   has been relatively stable. Several manufacturers announced product cost   adjustments to reflect changes in steel, copper, and agricultural prices. We   heard only scattered reports of companies hiring new workers, although several   firms have extended work hours. Wage pressures are contained. Real Estate New home sales have slowed during the past   six weeks, and all of our contacts expect construction to remain very sluggish   going into 2011. Builders continue to point to tight credit, foreclosures, and a   large inventory of existing homes as reasons for the depressed market. Most   homebuilders are intentionally keeping their spec inventories at low levels, and   those who want to build are unable to obtain financing. Our contacts tell us   that the entry-level price-point category is seeing the least activity, with   most sales occurring in the move-up buyer categories. The list prices of new   homes and construction material costs have shown little movement since our last   report. Several builders said that they are increasing the use of discounting to   close sales. General contractors and subcontractors continue to work with very   lean crews. Discussions with nonresidential builders showed little change in construction   activity since our last report and from year-ago levels. One contractor, who   noted a slow down, attributed it to seasonal factors. A few builders commented   that although their backlogs have slipped, they are encouraged by the number of   inquiries. New projects generally fall into the industrial category. Most of our   contacts expect little change in business conditions in the near-term, with   several mentioning that they are concerned about prospects for the recovery.   Reports indicated stable construction material costs. New hiring by general   contractors has diminished, while subcontractors are still struggling and   bidding at very competitive rates. Consumer Spending On balance, there was little change in   retail sales for the period from mid-August through mid-September, when compared   to the previous 30-day period. Consumers remain price sensitive and focused on   buying necessities. When given the option, they prefer private-label to premium   brands. Retailers expect conservative sales growth at best, going through the   holiday season. Several retailers noted modest price increases from their   suppliers, which they passed through selectively to consumers. Half of our   contacts reported on plans to increase capital budgets in 2011 relative to this   year. Hiring will be limited to temporary holiday workers. Auto dealers characterized new vehicle sales during August as decent,   although they were slower than those seen during the peak summer season. Many   sellers reported that August sales were down compared to year-ago levels due to   the cash-for-clunkers program. Looking toward the year's end, dealers expect   modest sales increases at best. New car inventories remain on the light side,   especially for popular models. Used vehicle purchases have picked up since our   last report, although supplies are tight and prices remain high. The number of   financing options is growing across the District, and pricing is competitive.   Still, credit standards are tight, and potential buyers often find themselves   unqualified for the vehicle they want to purchase. The incremental hiring at   auto stores that began in mid-summer has tapered off. Banking The business-lending environment remains soft;   however, almost half of the bankers we spoke with noted that demand showed some   signs of a pickup across industries. On the consumer side, conventional loan   demand remains very weak, with most of the activity found in indirect auto   lending and home equity lines of credit. Interest rates for business and   consumer credit moved by only a few basis points, with a slight bias to the   downside, as competitive pressures are growing. Most of our contacts said that   the demand for residential mortgage refinancing is very strong, while   new-purchase mortgage originations remain at a slow pace. Residential mortgage   rates continued their downward trend. Core deposits increased at almost all   banks, with most of the growth occurring in nonmaturing products. Credit quality   was generally characterized as either stable or deteriorating, while most   reports on delinquencies indicated rates were stable or showed a modest decline.   Several bankers noted that they have slowly increased their payrolls during the   past few months. Energy Reports indicate that oil and gas output was   mainly steady during the past six weeks, with output expected to remain at   current levels in the near term. Companies not participating in Marcellus shale   drilling, a largely untapped natural gas reserve, see the industry slowing down   during the next several months due to slumping gas prices. Nonetheless, some gas   producers reported increasing their capital outlays for additional drilling.   Spot prices for oil are holding up. Coal production has been fairly stable since   our last report, with little change in demand expected. Coal executives   commented that rising government intervention into permitting and compliance   issues may dampen capacity. Prices for coal were mixed but are tending to the   down side. Equipment and material costs have been relatively flat. We heard   scattered reports of companies hiring new workers. Transportation Freight transport executives reported   steady to declining volume during the past six weeks. Still, bottom lines have   improved for some carriers due to better pricing and higher productivity.   Looking forward, carriers expect that any further volume decline will be modest,   with a few anticipating a return to slow growth. Due to a drop in capacity   attributed to carriers exiting the industry and the enactment of additional   federal safety regulations, executives believe they will be able to successfully   negotiate more favorable rates as demand rises. A few of our contacts reported   rising prices for fuel. The cost of new tractors is substantially higher, while   used equipment prices are falling. Capital outlays are expected to increase at a   modest rate going into 2011, with most monies allocated for equipment   replacement. Current hiring is due to attrition.
