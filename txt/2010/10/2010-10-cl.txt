On balance, economic activity in the Fourth District held steady during the   past six weeks. Manufacturers reported that new orders and production rose   modestly. An uptick in residential construction, retail sales, and new car   buying that began in mid-summer has tapered off. Nonresidential building   activity showed little change. Reports from energy companies indicated stable   production, while freight carriers saw a small decline in volume. Demand for   business loans showed some signs of a pickup, and consumer borrowing remained   weak.
New hiring continues at a slower pace than seen earlier in the year. There   were scattered reports of increased payrolls in manufacturing, energy, and   banking. Overall, staffing-firm representatives noted that the number of new job   openings declined slightly, with available openings concentrated in healthcare   and professional business services. Wage pressures continue to be contained.   Apart from volatility in steel and commodity prices, raw materials and product   pricing were fairly steady.
Capacity utilization is slowly rising for several manufacturers and steel   producers, but it continues below pre-recession levels across the board.   Inventories are balanced with incoming orders. Capital outlays remain at   relatively low levels, with many of our contacts reporting that they have   postponed starting projects until they are certain of a sustainable recovery.   Other than volatility in steel and commodity prices, the cost of raw materials   has been relatively stable. Several manufacturers announced product cost   adjustments to reflect changes in steel, copper, and agricultural prices. We   heard only scattered reports of companies hiring new workers, although several   firms have extended work hours. Wage pressures are contained.
Discussions with nonresidential builders showed little change in construction   activity since our last report and from year-ago levels. One contractor, who   noted a slow down, attributed it to seasonal factors. A few builders commented   that although their backlogs have slipped, they are encouraged by the number of   inquiries. New projects generally fall into the industrial category. Most of our   contacts expect little change in business conditions in the near-term, with   several mentioning that they are concerned about prospects for the recovery.   Reports indicated stable construction material costs. New hiring by general   contractors has diminished, while subcontractors are still struggling and   bidding at very competitive rates.
Auto dealers characterized new vehicle sales during August as decent,   although they were slower than those seen during the peak summer season. Many   sellers reported that August sales were down compared to year-ago levels due to   the cash-for-clunkers program. Looking toward the year's end, dealers expect   modest sales increases at best. New car inventories remain on the light side,   especially for popular models. Used vehicle purchases have picked up since our   last report, although supplies are tight and prices remain high. The number of   financing options is growing across the District, and pricing is competitive.   Still, credit standards are tight, and potential buyers often find themselves   unqualified for the vehicle they want to purchase. The incremental hiring at   auto stores that began in mid-summer has tapered off.
