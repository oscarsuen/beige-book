Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas based on   information collected on or before October 8, 2010. This document summarizes   comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve   and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.
Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that, on balance,   national economic activity continued to rise, albeit at a modest pace, during   the reporting period from September to early October.
Manufacturing activity continued to expand, with production and new orders   rising across most Districts. Demand for nonfinancial services was reported to   be stable to modestly increasing overall. Consumer spending was steady to up   slightly, but consumers remained price-sensitive, and purchases were mostly   limited to necessities and nondiscretionary items. New vehicle sales held steady   or rose during the reporting period; sales of used automobiles were strong as   well. Activity in the travel and tourism sector picked up.
Housing markets remained weak with most Districts reporting sales below   year-ago levels. Reports on prices suggested stability, however. Conditions in   the commercial real estate sector were subdued, and construction was expected to   remain weak. Lending activity was stable in most Districts. Agricultural   conditions were generally favorable, and above-average yields were expected in   most reporting Districts. Activity in the energy sector continued to expand.
Input costs, most notably for agricultural commodities and industrial metals,   rose further. Shipping rates increased, and retailers in some Districts noted   rising wholesale prices. However, prices of final goods and services were mostly   stable as higher input costs were not passed on to consumers. Wage pressures   were minimal.
Refiners in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts noted a slowdown in   activity and rising inventories. Demand for construction-related products   remained weak, and reports on activity in the wood products and furniture   manufacturing industries were mixed.
Hiring at manufacturing firms remained sluggish. Inventories were generally   light or in line with orders. Future capital spending plans appeared to be   limited, except for in the St. Louis District where several manufacturers   reported plans to build new plants or expand operations. Manufacturers'   assessments of future factory activity were optimistic in the New York,   Philadelphia, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts, where contacts expect business   conditions to remain positive or to improve in coming months.
Accounting activity improved slightly, spurred by merger and acquisition   work. Contacts in the Boston and Dallas Districts noted increases in consulting   activity since the last report. Healthcare consulting picked up as businesses   responded to regulatory changes following healthcare reform. Appraisal and title   companies noted continued strength during the reporting period, and there were   some reports from architectural firms that activity had picked up.
Demand for transportation services appears to have slowed, although reports   were mixed. Freight companies in the Cleveland District noted steady to   declining volumes over the past six weeks, and Kansas City's report said   transportation firms saw unexpected weakness. Rail companies in the Atlanta   District reported positive, but slower growth of automobile and industrial goods   shipments, while port activity in the Richmond District was mixed. Dallas'   report said intermodal and railroad cargo volumes edged up, but growth in   international container trade volumes flattened, and small parcel shipping   volumes declined in September. San Francisco reported a pickup in demand for   trucking services.
Most Districts reported that sales of new vehicles held steady or rose during   the reporting period. Sales of used vehicles were strong as well. Inventories   remained tight, particularly for popular vehicles. Used car prices rose,   reflective of solid demand and lean inventories. Respondents' outlooks were for   slight growth in sales through year-end.
Reports from most Districts pointed to continued improvement in travel and   tourist activity. The Richmond District reported that tourist activity   strengthened, and contacts in San Francisco noted that growth in business travel   and convention activity led to rising visitor counts and hotel occupancy rates.   Hotel occupancy for popular tourist destinations in the Minneapolis and Kansas   City Districts also rose during the reporting period and was above year-ago   levels. New York's report noted that hotel occupancy rates remained high in   Manhattan, but October bookings were somewhat weaker than expected. Atlanta   noted that tourist activity in some areas was still being affected by the Gulf   oil spill, but losses incurred in these areas were offset by increased activity   in Northeast Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee and respondents' outlooks for the   remainder of the year were positive. Airline traffic was stable to slightly down   according to the Dallas District, but conditions were much better than a year   earlier thanks to strength in business travel. Restaurants and food service   contacts in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts also noted slight   increases in activity.
Single-family construction activity was at very low levels, but had improved   somewhat in the Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts. Atlanta reported   a softening of construction activity overall, and Minneapolis said single-family   building activity was mixed across metros. Builders in the Dallas District said   they had pulled back on starts considerably after the run-up earlier in the   year.
Respondents' outlooks suggested sales and construction would remain subdued   through year-end. There were some reports that tighter credit standards for   buyers and small builders, along with general economic uncertainty, were   stalling activity.
Conditions in the commercial real estate sector remained subdued. Reports   suggested rental rates continued to decline for most commercial property types.   The one exception was the apartment sector, where higher leasing activity led to   fewer concessions, most notably in Manhattan. Office, industrial and retail   rental markets remained weak, although there were a few reports of slight   increases in leasing activity in the Richmond, Chicago and Dallas Districts.   Commercial property sales were low overall, but contacts in the Chicago and   Dallas Districts said investment demand for distressed commercial properties   remained strong. Given lackluster demand for commercial space, nonresidential   construction activity was limited to mostly public projects, according to   District reports. Industry contacts appeared to believe that the commercial real   estate and construction sectors would remain weak for some time.
Demand for commercial and industrial loans remained weak as businesses   continued to postpone capital spending plans because of economic and public   policy uncertainties. However, merger and acquisition lending picked up in a few   Districts. Commercial real estate lending remained subdued and loan standards   were still tight.
On the consumer side, lending was sluggish, but there were scattered reports   of improvement. Contacts in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts reported growth   in auto loans. Residential mortgage lending and refinancing activity increased   in several Districts, and San Francisco reported an increase in demand for   nonconforming mortgage loans.
Credit quality changed little on balance. New York reported a decrease in   delinquency rates on consumer loans, however, and overall quality improved in   the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts, according to reports.
The energy sector continued to expand, with activity rising further in the   Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. The   Minneapolis District reported that mines were operating near capacity, and coal   production was robust in the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts. Firms in the   Dallas District noted strong domestic land-based drilling and a pickup in   overseas demand had offset losses resulting from the moratorium in the Gulf of   Mexico. The Cleveland and Kansas City Districts reported that strong activity   had prompted hiring and an increase in capital spending at some energy firms.   Respondents' outlooks were mostly positive, although low natural gas prices had   dampened the outlook for producers in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts.
Wage pressures remained minimal. Most District reports found little evidence   of wage increases in general. There were widespread reports across Districts   that firms anticipated increased costs of employee benefits as a result of   healthcare reform.
Hiring remained limited, with many firms reluctant to add to permanent   payrolls given economic softness. Reports from staffing firms were mixed.   Staffing firms in the New York and Dallas Districts noted a slowdown in demand   for their services, and contacts in the Cleveland District said new job openings   declined. Richmond's report noted demand for temporary workers picked up   slightly since the last report, and staffing contacts in the Philadelphia   District said clients were adding positions as workloads increased. The Atlanta   report noted a preference for increasing staff hours and using temporary help   rather than hiring additional full-time staff.
