Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to improve in June and   early July, but the rate of improvement slowed further. Most contacts remained   cautiously optimistic. However, increased uncertainty about the path of the   economic recovery negatively affected business and consumer confidence and   spending. Growth in manufacturing production eased and orders softened.   Construction decreased apart from public infrastructure. Consumer and business   spending increased at a slower rate. Credit conditions were slightly improved,   and price and wage pressures were small on balance. Crop conditions deteriorated   modestly.
