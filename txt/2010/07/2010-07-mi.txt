The Ninth District economy grew slightly since the last report. Consumer   spending, tourism, manufacturing, energy, mining and agriculture saw increases.   Residential construction and the services sectors experienced mixed activity,   while commercial construction remained weak. Commercial and residential real   estate activity decreased. Labor markets continued to strengthen somewhat. Wages   were generally level with a year ago, and price increases remained   restrained.
Summer tourism was up slightly from a year ago. Representatives of South   Dakota tourism businesses and attractions noted that the early part of the   summer season was going well. In western Montana, hotel bookings were about the   same as a year ago, while Glacier National Park is expected to have a record   year due to its 100th anniversary celebration. Tourism activity in the Upper   Peninsula of Michigan was about the same as last year. Meanwhile, a Minnesota   travel agency noted that corporate sales were up about 20 percent during June   and early July compared with 2009.
Weakness remained in the commercial real estate sector. Office vacancy   increased in Minneapolis-St. Paul. A commercial real estate broker in western   Montana characterized the market as level with last year's slow activity.   Residential real estate activity softened slightly. The number of closed sales   in Minneapolis-St. Paul decreased in June from a year earlier. A real estate   agent in Fargo said activity was steady, but not as active as usual for this   time of year. Meanwhile, a Realtor in northeastern Minnesota recently noticed an   increase in inquiries for properties.
Increases in temporary employment were noted. A representative of an   employment services firm in Minneapolis-St. Paul reported that demand for   temporary workers has continued to grow during the past two months. In the   Dakotas, demand for seasonal construction employment was up; however, temporary   construction and manufacturing employment was slow in the Duluth, Minn., area,   according to bank directors. In northwestern Montana, two employment offices   reported that postings for temporary and part-time listings were up; however,   overall job orders by employers were down 50 percent compared with a year ago.   Signs of continued weakness also include an announcement that a bank will lay   off about 80 employees in Minnesota.
Wages were generally level with a year earlier. Over 70 percent of   respondents to the St. Cloud survey expected no changes in employee compensation   over the next six months. A nurses union and 14 hospitals in the Minneapolis-St.   Paul area agreed on a contract that averted an open-ended strike; pension and   health benefits were not changed.
Price increases remained restrained. Minnesota gasoline prices at the   beginning of July were about the same as prices a month earlier. Bank directors   noted that prices have remained generally level for area businesses with some   exceptions. Significant increases included copper and brass products in   electrical wiring, steel fencing materials and unemployment taxes. Scrap metal   prices were above year-ago levels, but dropped during the past month.
