Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to pick up slightly during   the reporting period of June through mid-July. Upward price pressures remained   quite modest, and upward wage pressures were largely absent. Sales of retail   items and services firmed a bit further. Reports from District manufacturers   indicated continued expansion, although excess capacity remained high in some   sectors. Sales were strong for agricultural producers, and demand for energy   resources strengthened. Activity in housing markets was mixed but appeared to   decline on net, while demand for commercial real estate was largely unchanged at   very low levels. Contacts from financial institutions reported largely stable   lending activity and credit quality.
Contacts in most sectors characterized wages as largely flat, although some   pointed to significant increases in the costs of employee benefits, especially   for health insurance. Upward wage pressures were negligible in most sectors and   regions, held down by continued high levels of unemployment and limited hiring.   Reports throughout the District indicated that most businesses expect to remain   cautious in hiring for the foreseeable future. Contacts noted that their   reliance on temporary workers over permanent hires will continue above   historical norms.
Demand for services remained somewhat weak but exhibited further signs of   improvement on balance. Contacts in the restaurant and food services industry   reported modest increases in demand. For professional and media services   providers, sales were largely stable at low levels. Contacts noted that   potential clients increased their requests for bids, but the added interest   produced only limited numbers of new commitments. Demand for hospital services   was relatively flat, especially for discretionary services. Energy utilities   reported further increases in demand from selected industries, such as   technology, metal, and wood products. Conditions in the District's travel and   tourism sector continued to improve. Business travel and convention activity   picked up further, and visitor volumes and hotel occupancy rates rose in several   of the District's major markets, particularly Hawaii.
