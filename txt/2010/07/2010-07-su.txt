Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and   based on information collected on or before July 19, 2010. This document   summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the   Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve   officials.
Economic activity has continued to increase, on balance, since the previous   survey, although the Cleveland and Kansas City Districts reported that the level   of economic activity generally held steady. Among those Districts reporting   improvements in economic activity, a number of them noted that the increases   were modest, and two Districts, Atlanta and Chicago, said that the pace of   economic activity had slowed recently.
Manufacturing activity continued to expand in most Districts, although   several Districts reported that activity had slowed or leveled off during the   reporting period. Districts also noted improved conditions in the services   sector. The five Districts reporting on transportation noted increased activity.   Tourism activity also increased across the Districts, although the Atlanta   District noted concerns about decreased leisure travel to the Gulf Coast. Retail   sales reports generally indicated a continued rise in spending, and several   Districts noted that necessities continued to be strong sellers, while   big-ticket items moved more slowly. However, most Districts that reported on   auto sales noted declines in recent weeks. Activity in residential real estate   markets was sluggish in most Districts after the expiration of the April 30   deadline for the homebuyer tax credit. Commercial real estate markets,   especially construction, remained weak. Banking conditions varied across the   Districts, with some Districts noting soft or decreased overall loan demand;   credit standards remained tight in most reporting Districts. Recent rains had   mixed effects on crop conditions, while activity in the natural resources sector   increased. Overall labor market conditions improved modestly across the   Districts, with several reports of temporary hiring. Consumer prices of goods   and services held steady in most reporting Districts. Input prices also held   largely steady, with only a few reports of cost increases. Wage pressures   continued to be contained on the whole.
Activity in the services sector improved across most Districts since the   previous report. The freight transportation industry experienced gains in the   Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and Philadelphia Districts. Boston,   Minneapolis, and Dallas reported a pickup in demand for some consulting firms.   Tourism activity increased in the San Francisco, New York, Minneapolis,   Richmond, Kansas City, and Atlanta Districts. Atlanta reported that leisure   travel decreased in the Gulf Coast, but some of the lost tourist traffic was   offset by the presence of cleanup crews, oil company workers, and the National   Guard. Information technology firms saw increased business in the Philadelphia,   Chicago, and St. Louis Districts, while activity was flat in the Minneapolis   District. Demand for healthcare services was flat in both the San Francisco and   Richmond Districts, while activity increased in the Boston District.
The Districts that reported on auto sales during the early summer months   generally noted a decrease in recent sales. Since the previous report, auto   sales in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and San   Francisco Districts declined, while auto sales in the Kansas City District   increased and were unchanged in the Dallas District. Compared with last year,   auto sales in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts were higher. New York,   Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas all reported that   inventory levels were low or declining. Auto dealers anticipate little change in   sales for the rest of 2010 in the Philadelphia District and expect sales to   increase slowly in the Dallas District. Contacts in the Kansas City District   expect continued strong demand, while those in the Cleveland District do not   anticipate strong growth in the coming months.
Commercial and industrial real estate markets continued to struggle in all   twelve Districts. Overall, vacancy rates were flat to slightly increased and   continued to exert downward pressure on rents. Construction activity remained   weak in most Districts. The New York District noted that commercial development   remained generally sluggish despite some pickup in office and retail leasing in   New York City. Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported that construction   activity continued to be weak or to decline, and Cleveland reported that the   increase in construction from previous reports has begun to diminish.   Philadelphia reported that projects funded with federal stimulus support were   near completion with no prospects for additional major construction, while   Chicago reported that public infrastructure construction picked up. Developers   reported difficult credit conditions in the Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, and   Kansas City Districts, while the Dallas District reported a few developers going   out of business. The outlook for commercial and industrial real estate across   the Districts ranged from further declines in activity to slow growth.
Overall, activity in the energy sector increased since the previous report.   Oil production in the Atlanta District and oil and natural gas production in the   Cleveland District were relatively unchanged, but other activity picked up   throughout the Districts during the reporting period. The number of drilling   rigs increased in the Dallas District, and production continued to expand in the   Kansas City District. Additionally, oil exploration in the Minneapolis District   and oil extraction in the San Francisco District increased. Activity in the   Minneapolis District's mining sector increased in recent weeks, as did   production and demand for coal in the Cleveland District. Kansas City reported   that contacts expect to see continued growth in energy production.
Wage pressures remained largely contained across most Districts. Boston,   Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco reported little or no   change in wages, while Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City reported that wage   pressures were small or remained subdued. Dallas reported that wage pressures   were mostly nonexistent, with the exception of the airline industry.
Prices of final goods and services were relatively stable in most Districts.   Several Districts indicated that prices of raw materials also held steady, and   only a few Districts reported input price increases. Steel prices moved slightly   higher in the San Francisco District, but Cleveland and Chicago reported that   steel prices were down. Chicago and San Francisco noted an increase in energy   prices, but Atlanta reported that energy prices were mostly stable since the   onset of the Gulf oil spill. Increased prices were noted for some metals by the   Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts. Transportation costs   increased in the Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, and the Richmond   District noted that shipping lines were attempting to raise rates.
