Reports from Sixth District business contacts indicated that the pace of   economic activity slowed somewhat in June and early July. Retailers reported a   slight increase in traffic and sales, but their outlook was less optimistic than   the last report. Tourism reports were generally positive, however, significant   concerns were expressed over the potential impact from the oil spill on the Gulf   coast. Residential real estate contacts suggested that the pace of new and   existing home sales slowed, and their outlook was pessimistic. Commercial real   estate remained weak. Manufacturers saw a slight deceleration in activity as the   pace of new orders and production growth slowed. Banking credit conditions   remained tight and loan demand was subdued. Businesses continued to increase the   hours worked of existing staff and to expand their use of temporary hires.   Permanent hires were less apparent. Transportation and material costs rose   slightly, but most firms expressed no intention of passing these increases along   to consumers.
Overall, tourism continued to show signs of improvement compared with last   year. Reports from Miami and New Orleans indicated that business-related travel   and convention bookings remained positive. Leisure travel was positive in most   District destinations except for the Gulf coast where significant concerns were   reported over the oil spill and its impact on tourism. Hospitality contacts in   the area remarked that some cancelled bookings have been substituted by the   presence of clean-up crews, oil company workers, and the National Guard.   Contacts not located along the Gulf coast have stated that there have been   increased bookings as a result of deflected business from oil-affected   areas.
Nonresidential construction activity continued to be weak. The majority of   contacts noted that the pace of commercial development was below the   year-earlier level and backlogs remained at low levels. Vacancy rates were high   across the District and contacts witnessed downward pressure on rents. The   outlook for the rest of the year remained negative.
Despite reports of raw materials and transportation cost increases, most   firms conveyed no plans to pass the increases on to consumers. Several contacts   remarked that excess production capacity and competition continued to put   downward pressure on prices in a variety of sectors.
Dry conditions and high daytime temperatures have resulted in some crop   stress in parts of the District, but conditions overall continued to be good for   cotton and citrus crops. Cotton plantings have increased on a year-over-year   basis.
