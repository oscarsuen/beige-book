Economic conditions in the Eighth District have continued to improve since   our previous report. Manufacturing activity increased, on balance, as did   activity in the services sector. Auto sales increased over a year ago.   Residential real estate market conditions continued to improve across the   District's largest metropolitan areas, while commercial and industrial real   estate markets remained weak, especially construction. Overall lending activity   at a sample of small and mid-sized banks in the District decreased from early   April to late June.
Activity in the District's services sector has also increased since our   previous report. A major software publishing firm has announced plans to open a   new facility in the District and hire new workers. Additionally, a firm in   nursing care services announced plans to relocate their headquarters to the   District. In contrast, contacts in education services, air transportation   support services, and the casino industry announced plans to decrease operations   and lay off workers. Sales of new and used automobiles in recent weeks were   reported as higher than a year ago and slightly above expectations.
Commercial and industrial real estate market activity remained slow   throughout most of the District. Contacts noted that financing requirements for   new construction remained stringent and lease rates remained low. A contact in   St. Louis reported that commercial leasing was up in some areas, but new   commercial construction projects are not expected before mid-2011. Industrial   real estate and construction contacts throughout the District continued to   report a flat environment. A contact in Louisville reported that demand for   industrial real estate continued to be weak. A contact in the Memphis area   reported that while industrial leasing has improved somewhat, no new industrial   construction is likely before the end of the year.
