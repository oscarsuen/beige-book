Economic conditions in the Eighth District have continued to improve since   our previous report. Manufacturing activity increased, on balance, as did   activity in the services sector. Auto sales increased over a year ago.   Residential real estate market conditions continued to improve across the   District's largest metropolitan areas, while commercial and industrial real   estate markets remained weak, especially construction. Overall lending activity   at a sample of small and mid-sized banks in the District decreased from early   April to late June.
Manufacturing   activity has continued to increase since our previous report. Several   manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near   future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to close plants and   reduce operations. Firms in the furniture, plastics product, metal pipe, and   plastics resin manufacturing industries announced plans to expand operations and   hire new employees. Additionally, a major firm in the automobile manufacturing   industry announced the opening of a new production facility. In contrast, firms   in the motor and generator, furniture, and polystyrene foam product   manufacturing industries announced that they will close plants in the District   and lay off workers.
Activity in the District's services sector has also increased since our   previous report. A major software publishing firm has announced plans to open a   new facility in the District and hire new workers. Additionally, a firm in   nursing care services announced plans to relocate their headquarters to the   District. In contrast, contacts in education services, air transportation   support services, and the casino industry announced plans to decrease operations   and lay off workers. Sales of new and used automobiles in recent weeks were   reported as higher than a year ago and slightly above expectations.
Home sales continued to   improve throughout the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2009,   May 2010 year-to-date home sales were up 3 percent in Memphis, 12 percent in St.   Louis, 19 percent in Little Rock, and 30 percent in Louisville. Residential   construction also continued to improve throughout the District. May 2010   year-to-date single-family housing permits were up in most District metro areas   compared with the same period in 2009. Permits increased 27 percent in   Louisville, 31 percent in Little Rock, 36 percent in St. Louis, and 52 percent   in Memphis.
Commercial and industrial real estate market activity remained slow   throughout most of the District. Contacts noted that financing requirements for   new construction remained stringent and lease rates remained low. A contact in   St. Louis reported that commercial leasing was up in some areas, but new   commercial construction projects are not expected before mid-2011. Industrial   real estate and construction contacts throughout the District continued to   report a flat environment. A contact in Louisville reported that demand for   industrial real estate continued to be weak. A contact in the Memphis area   reported that while industrial leasing has improved somewhat, no new industrial   construction is likely before the end of the year.
Total loans outstanding at a sample   of small and mid-sized District banks decreased 2.0 percent from early April to   late June. Real estate lending, which accounts for 73.6 percent of total loans,   decreased 1.9 percent. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 16.0   percent of total loans, decreased 2.5 percent. Loans to individuals, accounting   for 5.3 percent of total loans, decreased 6.5 percent. All other loans, roughly   5.1 percent of total loans, increased 4.1 percent. During this period, total   deposits at these banks decreased 1.2 percent.
Generally, development   of the District's major crops remained ahead of its 5-year average pace. In   mid-July, the overall condition of rice and cotton was rated as slightly better   than last year, while the condition of corn, sorghum, and soybeans was rated as   slightly worse. Farmers in the District states planned to harvest more acres of   corn for grain and rice in 2010 than in 2009 but fewer acres of soybeans and   sorghum for grain. The winter wheat harvest was complete or nearly complete in   all District states. Based on July estimates, total winter wheat production in   the District states was expected to be down 48 percent from last year. Since our   previous report, pasture conditions deteriorated in most District states.
