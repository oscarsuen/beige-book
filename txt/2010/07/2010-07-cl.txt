On balance, economic activity in the Fourth District held steady during the   past seven weeks. Manufacturers reported that the rise in production which began   late last year is leveling off. Contacts in nonresidential construction cited   fewer inquiries and a small drop in backlog, while residential builders noted   that new home construction has slowed. Retail sales were flat to up slightly,   whereas auto dealers reported a slight downturn in new vehicle purchases. Energy   production increased modestly, and reports indicated a continuing upturn in   freight transport volume. Demand by businesses and consumers for new loans   remained weak.
A small pickup in employment was limited to the manufacturing sector.   Staffing-firm representatives reported some improvement in the number of new job   openings, with opportunities concentrated in the healthcare field. Wage   pressures continue to be contained. Apart from a downward trend in steel and   lumber prices, raw materials and product pricing was generally stable.
Little movement was seen in inventories, although we heard a few reports that   finished durable goods inventories were beginning to rise. A majority of our   contacts stated that their capacity utilization rates are below pre-recession   levels, with little change during the past few weeks. Capital outlays continue   at relatively low levels, and business owners are approaching spending decisions   with caution. Steel producers and service center representatives reported that   their prices are on the decline, reflecting a downward trend in steel production   input costs. Other raw material costs have been fairly stable. Companies   continue to expand payrolls and extend work hours, but at a slower pace. Wage   pressures are contained.
Signs of a pickup in nonresidential construction cited in our past two   reports are beginning to diminish. Although building activity remains steady,   several of our contacts reported declining inquiries and a slight drop in their   backlogs. Most inquiries and new projects underway fall within the industrial   and government-funded infrastructure categories. The glut in commercial space   shows no signs of lessening. Half of our contacts expressed a heightened level   of uncertainty about construction activity in the near term, though others   remain cautiously optimistic. Little change in construction material costs was   reported. We heard numerous accounts of contractors and clients struggling to   obtain financing. Other than seasonal hiring, employment rolls are steady. Many   subcontractors remain underutilized and are taking on projects at cost.
