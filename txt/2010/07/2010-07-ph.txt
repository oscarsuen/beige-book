Economic activity has moved up slightly in the Third District since the last   Beige Book, overall, although several sectors of the regional economy remained   soft. Manufacturers, on balance, reported an increase in shipments but a slight   decline in new orders in July. Retailers posted year-over-year increases in   sales of general merchandise for the month, but motor vehicle dealers indicated   that sales have decreased since the spring. Third District banks reported steady   loan volume outstanding. Residential real estate agents and home builders said   that home sales decreased sharply with the expiration in April of the federal   tax credit for purchases and that sales have continued to be soft since then.   Contacts in the commercial real estate sector said vacancy rates have been   nearly level, but rents have been flat to down. Construction contacts continued   to report low levels of activity. Service-sector companies generally reported   just slight gains in activity. Business firms in the region indicated that   prices of most goods and services have been steady, although there were   increased reports of rising prices for some metals and construction-related   products. Firms also reported increases in costs for employee health   insurance.
The outlook among Third District business contacts is guardedly positive, but   the level of optimism has waned somewhat since the last Beige Book.   Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next six   months, although the balance of positive over negative views has declined since   the previous report. Retailers expect sales to expand slightly but believe   consumer confidence remains fragile. Auto dealers expect the sales rate to be   steady in the months ahead, retreating from their previous view that sales would   increase. Bankers expect slow growth in lending. Contacts in both residential   and commercial real estate expect mostly flat activity during the rest of the   year. Service-sector companies expect slow and uneven improvement.
Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance, although the margin of positive opinions over   negative opinions has declined since the previous Beige Book. Among the firms   surveyed in July, about 40 percent expect increases in new orders and shipments,   and 20 percent expect decreases. Capital spending plans among area manufacturers   remain positive, on balance, but are not strong overall. About one-third of the   firms polled in July plan to increase expenditures for new plant and equipment,   but nearly one-half plan to maintain level spending, and nearly one-fourth   expect to reduce spending.
Third District auto dealers reported a drop in sales from May to June, with   continued slowness in July. Although dealers said there continue to be shortages   of popular models, they said overall demand for cars and light trucks has not   been as strong recently as it was earlier in the year. Dealers have trimmed   expectations since the last Beige Book; they now anticipate little change in the   sales rate during the rest of the year.
Looking ahead, Third District bankers expect slow loan growth, at best. They   generally expect slight gains in business lending but continued softness in   consumer and residential mortgage lending. Bank lending officers said credit   standards remain more restrictive than they had been in the past few years. For   business borrowers, one banker said this means a firm "must have stable   relationships with customers and vendors and show reasonable expectations about   cash flow" to be considered for new or renewed credit facilities.
Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that vacancy rates in commercial   and industrial buildings have been nearly steady or have moved up slightly in   most parts of the Third District in the past few months. Leasing activity has   been flat, and effective rents have been about level for Class A space but have   moved down for Class B space. Construction activity has been weak. Some contacts   reported that projects financed by federal stimulus funds are near completion or   have been finished and that there are no immediate prospects for more major   infrastructure construction. Commercial real estate contacts expect market   conditions to show little change in the second half of the year. One said,   "We're stabilizing, but if companies cut space needs the market will be dragged   down."
Business firms in the region reported little or no upward movement in wages,   and most indicated that they have had no difficulty in filling open positions.   Employment agencies reported that client companies have been cautious in adding   employees or replacing those who have left, although they have increased use of   temporary workers on an as-needed basis. Labor markets remain slack, according   to employers and employment agencies, who report that they generally get large   numbers of applicants for permanent positions; however, they also noted that   they get smaller numbers of applicants for temporary positions.
