Business activity continues to expand overall in the First District, but   individual firms' gains show some choppiness. Most contacted manufacturers and   advertising and consulting firms saw revenues rise in the most recent quarter on   a year-over-year basis, while retail results were more mixed in May and June.   Residential real estate markets continue to show positive effects of the   homebuyer tax credits, but activity slowed after the April deadline. Respondents   in commercial real estate were mostly downbeat based on office job forecasts,   but building sales are picking up, in some cases at distress prices. A few firms   with rising sales are increasing their headcounts, but most are holding   employment steady. Input costs for some metals, oil- and food-related products   have risen, but sales prices are mostly stable.
Inventory levels are mixed, with some increases due to softening sales; on   the other hand, decreased ocean freight capacity is raising concerns regarding   firms' ability to restock in a cost-effective and timely manner. Capital   spending is also mixed, with some retailers spending on new store openings,   remodels, and IT systems, while others remain cautious. Headcounts are growing   modestly, with most increases attributed to opportunistic hiring and new store   growth, but a few contacts indicate that staff cutbacks may occur in the future.   Retailers note cost increases for cotton and food-related commodities.
Most contacted manufacturing firms continue to report limited price pressure.   Input costs remain relatively stable. One manufacturer who uses many raw metals   in the production process says that prices remain higher than a year ago, but   have come down somewhat since the first quarter. A couple of firms who use   oil-related products also report somewhat higher input prices. Selling prices   are generally fairly stable. One manufacturer that implemented a moderate (3   percent) price increase in the first quarter says that the increase held. By   contrast, a firm that makes both capital equipment and consumables cites   downward price pressure on the capital goods they sell (as companies remain wary   about the costs of large items), but not on the consumables; this has been the   case for about a year.
Employment continues to be steady at nearly all responding manufacturing   firms, and most say they are unlikely to expand headcount substantially in the   near term. A number of firms plan to hire to support new product lines or in   divisions that are experiencing robust growth. A semiconductor-related firm, in   particular, plans to increase its engineering workforce by about 150 by   year-end; that firm's employment is already above its pre-recession peak due to   strong demand.
Manufacturers once again report that their planned 2010 capital expenditures   are in line with or somewhat higher than their expenditures in 2009. Planned   increases are primarily for new product releases and/or infrastructure and   IT-related improvements. Credit supply remains adequate for firm investment, and   many manufacturers also report having adequate cash on hand for investment   purposes.
Overall, contacted manufacturers are generally optimistic about the second   half of 2010 and 2011. The firms remain cautious, however, as uncertainty   continues to surround the domestic and foreign demand environments.
Consulting and marketing firms indicate that business costs are stable and   they are also generally holding their list prices steady, although some firms   have been able to remove the price concessions they made in 2009. Several   companies mention that they are replacing their laptops and purchasing new   software licenses. Employment is mostly steady, with firms simply making   replacement hires or modestly increasing the number of employees; more hires are   expected in the second half of the year. Wages are either stable or rising   slightly, by 2 percent to 5 percent.
Advertising and consulting contacts are optimistic about their firms'   performance in the second half of the year, primarily based on the increasing   volume of sales and the improving economic situation. However, many respondents   see downside risks to this outlook, notably the chance of a double-dip   recession; firms that contract with the government also note that budget cuts in   response to deficit concerns would harm their businesses.
With regard to commercial real estate debt markets, one noteworthy   development is that special servicers (who manage CMBS issues) are reportedly   starting to dispose of an increasing number of securitized mortgages in default   rather than continuing to extend troubled loans. This trend is expected to   accelerate over the next 6 to 12 months. At the same time, banks continue to   hold large sums of distressed commercial real estate debt and have not yet   initiated large numbers of foreclosures. Contacts across the region remain   concerned about the potential impact of inevitable foreclosures, especially if a   large number occur in a compressed time period; contacts say, however, that New   England is likely to fare relatively well compared to other regions with respect   to commercial foreclosures.
In Hartford, expectations for market turnaround were pushed back a quarter,   out to late 2010. In Boston, contacts expect net absorption to remain slow, and   predict that office rents still have further to fall, but were uncertain as to   whether job growth (and related demand for commercial space) would continue at   current levels or become weaker in the second half of 2010. The outlook for   Providence is cautiously optimistic, but "optimistic" was defined as slow growth   rather than further deterioration.
A New Hampshire contact says that some types of homes are still selling well,   notably those in convenient locations near major highways. Meanwhile, prices in   rural New Hampshire are "plummeting." In addition, high-end vacation homes are   starting to move again after very low activity during 2008 and 2009. A   Boston-area contact believes that pent-up demand among potential buyers (because   inventory was low) will help moderate the size of the slowdown associated with   the expiration of the tax credit.
