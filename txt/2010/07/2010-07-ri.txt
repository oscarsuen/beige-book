District economic activity was generally described as either mixed or   modestly improving since our last report. While manufacturing remained a bright   spot, the pace of activity reported in our last assessment appears to have eased   somewhat--particularly among firms supplying the housing sector. Port   authorities reported a pick-up in activity, led by recent increases in import   volumes. Bank lending to businesses improved moderately, while home mortgage   lending varied widely around the District. Tourism also strengthened. In   addition, local labor markets posted modest gains, with temp agencies reporting   gains especially from the manufacturing sector. On a weaker note, residential   real estate agents and contacts at other services firms described activity as   mixed. Finally, commercial real estate agents and retailers reported generally   softer market conditions, but both sectors cited at least some pockets of   improvement.
Port activity in the District picked up since our last report. One contact   stated that total shipping volume at his port was back to pre-recession levels.   While exports had been improving over much of this year, he noted that imports   were now increasing as well. A contact that handles a variety of roll-on cargo   stated that about two-thirds of the recent gains in port activity were being   driven by imports. At least some of the import gains were attributed to   inventory restocking. Several port officials noted that shipping lines were   attempting to raise rates.
Commercial real estate markets continued to weaken since our last report,   with at least one contact not expecting improvements until well into the future.   According to one contact in North Carolina, vacancy rates in most metro areas   remained relatively high and were still rising in some areas. Vacancy rates were   particularly high in the retail sector in both Richmond and Baltimore, according   to several agents. Retail and office leasing activity was reported to be   improving in Columbia, S.C., as well as in parts of North Carolina. Commercial   rental rates in parts of North Carolina were being driven down by property   owners' fears that things could get worse, and an agent stated that retail   rental rates remained negotiable in Richmond. One contact stated that new   construction financing was "not going at all."
