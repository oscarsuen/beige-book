The Eleventh District economy expanded at a moderate pace over the past six   weeks, although business outlooks were slightly more cautious. Respondents in   most sectors said activity improved or held steady since the last report. The   notable exception came from homebuilders and construction-related manufactures   who said demand dropped off following the expiration of the first-time homebuyer   tax credit. The majority of Eleventh District respondents expect economic   conditions to remain positive, but many expressed uncertainty about the pace of   future growth. Numerous contacts said uncertainty regarding fiscal and financial   reforms was restraining business activity. Prices Selling prices held steady for most responding   firms. There were scattered reports that rising input costs were squeezing   margins. Notably, paper producers said linerboard prices continued to rise, and   high-tech firms said supply-chain problems had increased costs for producers.   Some transportation service firms had raised fees but reduced fuel surcharges.   Lumber producers said prices had come down since the spring run-up, and staffing   firms continued to note pressure to reduce fees. Contacts in residential   construction said industry consolidation has led to fewer concessions in   pricing. Crude oil prices traded in a range of about $70 to $75 per barrel   from late May through early July, down from the previous report. On-highway   prices of both gasoline and diesel fell about 5 percent during the reporting   period. Natural gas prices mostly ranged between $4.50 and $5.00 per Mcf--moving   up briefly over $5.00 per Mcf in June. The increase in petrochemical prices seen   earlier in the year due to capacity outages has reversed course. Labor Market The majority of respondents noted steady   employment levels, although there were scattered reports of hiring activity.   Staffing firms said demand continued to increase for their services, and some   contacts in residential construction, construction-related manufacturing,   aircraft manufacturing and auto sales had added workers. On a less positive   note, contacts in the energy industry said the moratorium on deepwater drilling   resulted in significant regional layoffs, although energy service companies were   shifting Gulf Coast workers to land or shallow water projects when possible.   Wage pressures were mostly nonexistent, with the exception of the airline   industry. Although the overall labor market remains slack one transportation   service provider was offering signing bonuses to truck operators, and a few   firms noted difficulty finding skilled workers.
Manufacturing Most construction-related manufacturers   reported a slowdown in activity, and outlooks were less optimistic than in the   previous report. Producers that sell to the homebuilding industry said orders   dropped off more than expected following the expiration of the first-time   homebuyer tax credit. Contacts also reported declines in private nonresidential   construction. Fabricated metals producers said sales growth flattened since the   last report, while primary metals firms said activity picked up slightly, but   was bouncing along the bottom. Production and new orders for high-tech manufacturing continue to grow at a   strong pace. Capital expenditures that were postponed during the recession are   driving purchasing, according to respondents. Inventories were in good shape,   having built up from extremely low levels early in the year. Respondents expect   demand to continue to grow at a strong pace for the next three to six months,   but there is increased uncertainty about the outlook for 2011. Manufacturers of aircraft and parts said sales had improved, with orders   coming mostly from the commercial and general aviation industries. Budget   cutbacks have curbed governmental and military sales. An aircraft repair contact   said growth in demand had softened slightly, and the backlog of orders had   dropped. Orders for emergency vehicles remained flat and backlogs edged down,   but not as much as contacts had expected given budget strains among   municipalities. Reports on demand for paper products were mixed, but most contacts said sales   are about even with or slightly higher than a year ago. Food producers noted   increased demand, and outlooks were positive. Producers of petrochemicals used in housing and commercial construction (PVC)   said orders fell since the last report, and expectations are for no near-term   improvement. Other than PVC, there were no signs of weakness in chemicals.   Demand was strong for petrochemicals used in manufacturing, pulp and paper and   alumina. In addition, contacts said domestic demand for ethylene/polyethylene   products remained solid, and that export demand has returned slowly as capacity   was restored and prices declined. Refiners said gasoline demand was steady in   recent weeks while diesel demand has improved. Refinery utilization rates   improved to near 90 percent, as refiner margins remain relatively strong. Retail Reports from retail contacts point to solid   growth. Department store sales were slightly stronger than anticipated, but the   pace is expected to moderate in the second half. Consumers continue to   deleverage and correspondingly remain price sensitive. Sales growth in the   Eleventh District tracked slightly below the nation. Expectations are for   continued gradual improvement through year-end. Automobile sales were unchanged over the reporting period, and contacts said   inventories were lean. The outlook is cautiously optimistic, with sales expected   to rise slowly. Services Most staffing firms report strong demand across   a wide range of industries. The majority of placement activity continues to be   conversions of temporary workers to hires. Direct placement remains reduced as   businesses are hesitant to add to permanent payrolls. While near-term outlooks   remain optimistic, respondents are still cautious about the longer term. Demand   for accounting services was sluggish, but above year-ago levels. Tax-related   services slowed seasonally, but transactional and consulting activity picked up   slightly. Demand for legal services held steady at low levels, but most contacts   were slightly more optimistic in their outlooks. Accounting and legal contacts   said uncertainty about fiscal and financial reform was holding back business   activity. Demand for transportation services strengthened. Several contacts said cargo   volumes were up considerably, with the increases being broad-based across   industry sectors. Railroad respondents noted cargo volumes rose strongly across   the board, with a particularly large increase in metals that was likely due to   an improved auto industry and stronger demand for home appliances. Shipping   firms said retail trade was boosting volumes for small package shipping. Airline   traffic was down slightly since the last report, but up strongly compared to a   year ago. Outlooks for the transportation services industry were generally   positive but cautious. Construction and Real Estate Builders of low-to-moderate   priced homes reported a significant drop off in housing sales in May and June   following the expiration of the first time-homebuyer tax credit. The pace of   decline slowed in early July, and some contacts are hopeful the tax-credit   "hangover" may be over. New home starts overall are expected to come down in the   second half of the year, and outlooks for the homebuilding industry remain   guarded. Existing home sales softened slightly in recent weeks, according to   contacts, but activity for the year is up from the same period in 2009.   Apartment demand continues to improve. Commercial real estate markets remain weak. While a few lease deals have   taken place, demand for space overall remains subdued and rents are edging down.   As such, nonresidential construction activity continues to decline, and there   were a few reports of developers going out of business. On a positive note,   contacts said improvement in debt markets had spurred some property sales, and   prices were up from the trough. One contact noted an increase in lender sales as   banks work through nonperforming loans. Financial Services Loan demand remained soft with   weakness across all categories. Nonperforming loans have stabilized and are not   expected to worsen, although contacts said it will be a while before they come   down noticeably. Deposits were mostly steady, but responding institutions said   fewer loans pushed down the loan-to-deposit ratio. An over-riding theme among   financial industry respondents is uncertainty over fiscal and financial reform   legislation that has created a wait-and-see mentality. The uncertainty is   delaying transactions, depressing loan activity and causing some institutions to   look for alternative ways to grow loan portfolios and earnings. Energy The U.S. and District rig counts increased during   the reporting period, despite a drop of 39 rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. As the   share of oil-directed drilling continues to rise, natural-gas directed drilling   was surprisingly steady despite high inventories and low prices. Some contacts   noted that shale activity is stronger than prices justify due to urgency to   secure leases in new basins and an influx of foreign capital attracted by new   shale technology. Agriculture Tropical storms brought widespread rains to   Texas, particularly benefitting parts of the state that had been getting dry.   Favorable crop conditions and robust forage production on pastures have   increased optimism among agricultural producers. Cattle prices have declined,   though ranchers still anticipate strong prices compared to last year. The recent   rainfall will boost yields for Texas cotton, potentially pushing down   prices.
