The Eleventh District economy expanded at a moderate pace over the past six   weeks, although business outlooks were slightly more cautious. Respondents in   most sectors said activity improved or held steady since the last report. The   notable exception came from homebuilders and construction-related manufactures   who said demand dropped off following the expiration of the first-time homebuyer   tax credit. The majority of Eleventh District respondents expect economic   conditions to remain positive, but many expressed uncertainty about the pace of   future growth. Numerous contacts said uncertainty regarding fiscal and financial   reforms was restraining business activity.
Crude oil prices traded in a range of about $70 to $75 per barrel   from late May through early July, down from the previous report. On-highway   prices of both gasoline and diesel fell about 5 percent during the reporting   period. Natural gas prices mostly ranged between $4.50 and $5.00 per Mcf--moving   up briefly over $5.00 per Mcf in June. The increase in petrochemical prices seen   earlier in the year due to capacity outages has reversed course.
Production and new orders for high-tech manufacturing continue to grow at a   strong pace. Capital expenditures that were postponed during the recession are   driving purchasing, according to respondents. Inventories were in good shape,   having built up from extremely low levels early in the year. Respondents expect   demand to continue to grow at a strong pace for the next three to six months,   but there is increased uncertainty about the outlook for 2011.
Manufacturers of aircraft and parts said sales had improved, with orders   coming mostly from the commercial and general aviation industries. Budget   cutbacks have curbed governmental and military sales. An aircraft repair contact   said growth in demand had softened slightly, and the backlog of orders had   dropped. Orders for emergency vehicles remained flat and backlogs edged down,   but not as much as contacts had expected given budget strains among   municipalities.
Reports on demand for paper products were mixed, but most contacts said sales   are about even with or slightly higher than a year ago. Food producers noted   increased demand, and outlooks were positive.
Producers of petrochemicals used in housing and commercial construction (PVC)   said orders fell since the last report, and expectations are for no near-term   improvement. Other than PVC, there were no signs of weakness in chemicals.   Demand was strong for petrochemicals used in manufacturing, pulp and paper and   alumina. In addition, contacts said domestic demand for ethylene/polyethylene   products remained solid, and that export demand has returned slowly as capacity   was restored and prices declined. Refiners said gasoline demand was steady in   recent weeks while diesel demand has improved. Refinery utilization rates   improved to near 90 percent, as refiner margins remain relatively strong.
Automobile sales were unchanged over the reporting period, and contacts said   inventories were lean. The outlook is cautiously optimistic, with sales expected   to rise slowly.
Demand for transportation services strengthened. Several contacts said cargo   volumes were up considerably, with the increases being broad-based across   industry sectors. Railroad respondents noted cargo volumes rose strongly across   the board, with a particularly large increase in metals that was likely due to   an improved auto industry and stronger demand for home appliances. Shipping   firms said retail trade was boosting volumes for small package shipping. Airline   traffic was down slightly since the last report, but up strongly compared to a   year ago. Outlooks for the transportation services industry were generally   positive but cautious.
Commercial real estate markets remain weak. While a few lease deals have   taken place, demand for space overall remains subdued and rents are edging down.   As such, nonresidential construction activity continues to decline, and there   were a few reports of developers going out of business. On a positive note,   contacts said improvement in debt markets had spurred some property sales, and   prices were up from the trough. One contact noted an increase in lender sales as   banks work through nonperforming loans.
