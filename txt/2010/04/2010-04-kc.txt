The Tenth District economy expanded moderately during March, and District   contacts expected economic conditions to improve further in coming months.   Warmer weather conditions led to increased retail traffic and supported a modest   rebound in consumer spending, generating some optimism among District contacts.   Manufacturing and transportation activity continued their steady rebound,   resulting in a few new hires. District housing activity rose and contacts   anticipated further improvements in coming months. In contrast, commercial   construction activity continued to wane. Energy activity expanded further, but   natural gas production was expected to ease with slower summer demand.   Agricultural conditions remained solid as livestock profits improved and strong   crop profitability boosted planting expectations this spring. Wage pressures   remained muted and retail prices held steady, but some manufacturers were   considering raising selling prices due to higher raw material costs.
