The economy in the Fourth District showed further signs of strengthening   since our last report. Manufacturers told us that the rise in production which   began late last year continued, although orders remain below pre-recession   levels. Contacts in non-residential construction noted some signs of renewed   growth, but they are concerned about its sustainability. Financing remains a   major issue for residential and commercial contractors. Sales figures from   District retailers and auto dealers showed a moderate improvement. Energy   production was mixed and reports indicate a continuing upturn in freight   transport volume. Demand by businesses and consumers for new loans remains weak,   although some bankers noted that the lending environment is starting to grow   more competitive.
A pickup in employment was notable in the manufacturing sector, where   businesses are recalling some workers and increasing production hours. A   majority of staffing-firm representatives indicated that new job openings   increased, primarily in healthcare. Wage pressures continue to be contained.   Apart from rising prices for steel and petroleum-based products, raw materials   and product pricing was generally stable.
Reports on inventories were mixed. Half of our contacts said that product   supplies are low relative to demand, while others reported that their   inventories remain well balanced. Capacity utilization continued a slow upward   trend. Capital outlays are on target, with monies being allocated primarily for   maintenance projects, new equipment, or IT upgrades. Manufacturers said that   outlays will remain below pre-recession levels until a robust recovery is   underway. We heard many reports of increasing steel prices, which were   attributed primarily to rising raw materials (iron ore, scrap, and alloys)   costs. There was little response on the part of manufacturers to raise their own   prices because of relatively weak market conditions. However, some of our   respondents are beginning to initiate materials surcharges. We heard numerous   reports of recalling laid-off workers and increased work hours, while new hiring   was limited to temporaries. Wage pressures are contained.
Activity in non-residential construction showed early signs of a pickup.   Inquiries have improved, and many contractors said that they are beginning to   rebuild their backlogs. Most projects currently under-way fall within the   industrial and energy categories. Half of our contacts are uncertain about the   level of construction activity for the remainder of 2010, while others see a   small improvement when compared to 2009. We continue to hear accounts of   difficulties in obtaining project financing, even for credit-worthy borrowers.   Increased costs for construction materials were limited to steel and   petroleum-based products. General contractors reported that other than seasonal   hiring, their employment levels have been flat. Subcontractors are still   struggling, with many of them taking on projects at cost.
