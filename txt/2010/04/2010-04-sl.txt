Economic conditions in the Eighth District softened in most sectors since our   previous report. Manufacturing activity declined on balance, as did activity in   the services sector. Although residential real estate markets remained weak,   home sales and issuance of construction permits increased in some metropolitan   areas of the District. Activity in the commercial and industrial real estate   markets, construction in particular, remained weak throughout the District.   Overall lending activity at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks   decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the fourth quarter   of 2009.
Manufacturing   activity declined since our previous report. Contacts reported more plant   closures and job layoffs than plant openings and new hires. Several   manufacturers reported plans to consolidate operations and lay off employees,   including firms in the appliance; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning;   steel; and machinery manufacturing industries. Furthermore, firms in the   construction materials, auto parts, and food and beverage manufacturing   industries announced plans to close a plant in the District. In contrast, a   major firm in defense goods manufacturing announced plans to add new jobs and   expand production. Several small firms in food and beverage manufacturing and   metal products manufacturing announced plans to expand operations and hire new   workers.
The District's services sector also continued to decline despite the increase   in temporary employment from the 2010 Census. Several regional government   agencies and education services providers announced job cuts in response to   declining budgets. A major firm in print and publishing services announced it   will close a facility in the District. A large medical services provider also   announced significant job cuts to achieve operational efficiencies. In contrast,   a large regional transportation authority was awarded a major contract from the   Department of Transportation, and a firm in business support services announced   plans to hire new workers. Contacts in the retail sector noted the opening of   several new establishments, particularly in the food industry. A major trade   show also signed a long-term lease with a metropolitan area in the District. An   auto dealer noted stronger than expected demand, particularly for light sport   utility vehicles.
Home sales were mixed in the   Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2009, February 2010   year-to-date home sales were down 5 percent in Little Rock and 9 percent in   Memphis and St. Louis. Year-to-date home sales in Louisville, however, were up   16 percent for the same period. Residential construction, on the other hand, is   improving throughout most of the District. February 2010 year-to-date   single-family housing permits increased in most District metro areas compared   with the same period in 2009. Permits increased 17 percent in Louisville, 30   percent in Memphis, 41 percent in Little Rock, and 60 percent in St. Louis.
Commercial real estate and construction markets continued to struggle   throughout the District. A contact in St. Louis expects commercial property   foreclosures to rise. A contact in Evansville, Indiana, reported that major   construction is still slow. A contact in northeast Arkansas noted that the only   major construction projects are related to a local university and medical   center. Industrial real estate and construction contacts throughout most of the   District also continued to report a sluggish environment. A contact in   Louisville described the first-quarter industrial real estate market as dismal.   A contact in Memphis, however, indicated that industrial real estate may be   showing signs of improvement. A contact in St. Louis expects little to no   speculative industrial construction to take place in 2010.
Total loans outstanding at a sample   of small and mid-sized District banks decreased 2.7 percent in the first quarter   of 2010 relative to the fourth quarter of 2009. Lending activity in various   sectors was mixed, however. Real estate lending, which accounts for 73.6 percent   of total loans, decreased 2.3 percent. Commercial and industrial loans,   accounting for 16.1 percent of total loans, decreased 4.9 percent. Loans to   individuals, accounting for 5.6 percent of loans, increased 3.3 percent. All   other loans decreased 8.3 percent. Over this period, total deposits increased   0.6 percent.
Total winter wheat   acreage in the District states in 2010 decreased by 41 percent from 2009 levels,   and most of each state's crop was reported to be in fair or good condition.   Farmers in the District reported that they expect to plant 5 percent more acres   of corn and 10 percent more acres of both cotton and rice in 2010 than in 2009.   In contrast, they anticipate planting 6 percent fewer acres of sorghum and 4   percent fewer acres of tobacco than last year. They expect to plant the same   number of acres of soybeans as last year.
