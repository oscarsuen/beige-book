Economic conditions in the Eighth District softened in most sectors since our   previous report. Manufacturing activity declined on balance, as did activity in   the services sector. Although residential real estate markets remained weak,   home sales and issuance of construction permits increased in some metropolitan   areas of the District. Activity in the commercial and industrial real estate   markets, construction in particular, remained weak throughout the District.   Overall lending activity at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks   decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the fourth quarter   of 2009.
The District's services sector also continued to decline despite the increase   in temporary employment from the 2010 Census. Several regional government   agencies and education services providers announced job cuts in response to   declining budgets. A major firm in print and publishing services announced it   will close a facility in the District. A large medical services provider also   announced significant job cuts to achieve operational efficiencies. In contrast,   a large regional transportation authority was awarded a major contract from the   Department of Transportation, and a firm in business support services announced   plans to hire new workers. Contacts in the retail sector noted the opening of   several new establishments, particularly in the food industry. A major trade   show also signed a long-term lease with a metropolitan area in the District. An   auto dealer noted stronger than expected demand, particularly for light sport   utility vehicles.
Commercial real estate and construction markets continued to struggle   throughout the District. A contact in St. Louis expects commercial property   foreclosures to rise. A contact in Evansville, Indiana, reported that major   construction is still slow. A contact in northeast Arkansas noted that the only   major construction projects are related to a local university and medical   center. Industrial real estate and construction contacts throughout most of the   District also continued to report a sluggish environment. A contact in   Louisville described the first-quarter industrial real estate market as dismal.   A contact in Memphis, however, indicated that industrial real estate may be   showing signs of improvement. A contact in St. Louis expects little to no   speculative industrial construction to take place in 2010.
