Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to improve modestly   during the reporting period of late February into early April. Upward price   pressures were quite limited, and upward wage pressures were largely absent.   Sales of retail items and services remained somewhat sluggish, but both   continued to show signs of improved demand. District manufacturing activity   firmed a bit further, with improvement noted even in the sectors that have been   among the most troubled, such as metal fabrication and wood products. Sales   continued to expand for agricultural products, while demand for energy resources   was mixed. Housing demand appeared to be little changed from the previous   period, but conditions in commercial real estate eroded a bit further on net.   Contacts from financial institutions reported largely stable lending activity   and further declines in credit quality.
Upward wage pressures remained largely nonexistent, although businesses   continued to report significant increases in the costs of employee benefits,   such as health insurance and pensions. High levels of unemployment throughout   the District kept wage pressures to a minimum, and contacts noted continuing   work furloughs and hiring freezes in some sectors. Rising reliance on temporary   workers in some sectors put additional downward pressure on wages for permanent   employees.
Demand for services remained lackluster overall but showed further signs of   improvement on balance. Contacts in the restaurant and food services industry   noted modest increases in demand. For providers of professional and media   services, sales were largely stable at low levels, although they rose slightly   for some categories. Energy utilities reported increased demand from households   and from businesses in selected industries, notably large retail establishments   and firms in the technology, health services, and lodging sectors. Conditions   improved a bit further in the tourism and leisure sector: contacts in the   Southern California and Seattle markets noted recent increases in hotel   occupancy rates, while contacts in Hawaii and Las Vegas saw additional increases   in visitor volumes.
