Economic activity in the Seventh District improved in March, and contacts   indicated that consumer and business confidence were on the rise. Manufacturing   continued to lead the way, while consumer and business spending also increased   and credit conditions improved. Construction, however, remained weak. Price   pressures were small on balance. The spring weather resulted in good progress   toward normal planting conditions.
