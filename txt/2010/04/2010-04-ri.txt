Economic activity improved across the Fifth District since our last   assessment. Retail sales improved, despite weak sales of big-ticket items.   Manufacturing activity continued to advance, as evidenced by further increases   in shipments and orders. House sales showed some improvement, although prices   continued to edge downward, and commercial leasing also experienced a slight   uptick over the last six weeks. Tourist activity improved, with bookings showing   moderate strength at both mountain and coastal resorts. While activity in both   the service and banking sectors remained mixed, positive reports were more   prevalent than in our last assessment. Labor markets were weak throughout the   District, with steady employment in manufacturing and falling employment on the   retail side of the service sector. Moderate price increases were reported in   both manufacturing and service sectors. Finally, excessive dampness delayed the   planting of crops in most areas of the District.
Port activity over the last few months was up slightly. Both imports and   exports posted moderate gains, although exports tended to outperform import   gains. While the dollar was seen as a contributing factor, most contacts   attributed gains in exports primarily to improvements in overseas markets. One   contact stated that exports would have been even stronger if the right mix of   containers had been available. However, shipping costs increased in recent   months, which discouraged some companies from exporting. One contact also   reported that total tonnage so far this year was down from the fourth quarter of   last year, partly due to adverse weather that prevented producers from getting   their goods to the docks.
Commercial real estate activity picked up slightly since our last report.   Most contacts generally reported an uptick in leasing activity, particularly in   the office and industrial sectors, while activity in the retail sector remained   sluggish. Effective rental rates decreased somewhat as landlords became more   aggressive in offering concessions. Vacancy rates were generally high, although   vacancy rates in some local markets did improve. Sales activity continued to be   hampered by stringent bank requirements and a scarcity of creditworthy buyers.   However, one contact reported that property sales increased somewhat due to   foreclosed properties being purchased at very low prices. While contacts   reported very little new construction over the past few weeks, some activity was   reported on the industrial side for some build-to-suit projects and some bidders   continued to submit proposals at low or no profit just to keep their doors open.
