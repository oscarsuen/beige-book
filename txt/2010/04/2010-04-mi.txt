The Ninth District economy grew moderately since the last report. Consumer   spending, tourism, residential real estate and construction, services,   manufacturing, energy, mining and agriculture saw increases. Commercial real   estate was flat at low levels, and construction activity was slow. Labor markets   remained weak, but some signs of hiring were noted. Overall compensation levels   were flat, and price increases were moderate.
Vehicle sales picked up in March compared with a year ago when sales were   substantially down. A number of dealerships in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area   reported that sales were up over 40 percent in March compared with a year ago;   strong incentives by automakers helped boost sales. Recent vehicle sales have   been steady in North Dakota, according to a representative of an auto dealers   association.
Overall travel and tourism activity was up slightly. A ski resort in northern   Minnesota noted that February and March ski lift sales and lodging were higher   than a year ago. A Minnesota-based travel agency noted that corporate travel   during February and March was up slightly from a year ago. Winter tourism   activity was about even with a year ago in Montana, but tourism-based businesses   noted an uptick in February and March, according to an official. In northwestern   Wisconsin, excellent snow conditions boosted snowmobiling and cross-country   skiing in February; warm weather in March brought an early end to snow sports,   but tourism businesses are optimistic for the summer season.
Meanwhile, residential construction showed signs of strengthening. March home   building permits for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area more than doubled in value   from the same month a year earlier--their highest level since 2007--primarily   due to gains in the multifamily sector. In contrast, February residential   permits in Sioux Falls decreased 21 percent from a year earlier. Construction   activity in western Montana continues to be very slow, according to developers   there.
Commercial real estate was flat at low levels. A commercial real estate   broker in Fargo, N.D., said vacancy rates were down slightly for office   properties, but the industrial segment was weaker. A Minnesota commercial broker   said rents there were at their lowest levels since 1990.
Residential real estate continued to rebound. Closed sales in late March were   11 percent higher than a year earlier in Minneapolis-St. Paul, and sales prices   increased. Sales also picked up in western Montana, due in part to big   reductions in asking prices.
In contrast, two employment placement firms in Minnesota reported an increase   in hiring for some entry level positions and an increased interest in executive   placement services. Also in Minnesota, a bank announced intentions to hire more   wealth management advisors, a wind energy project just under way will create 150   jobs and an auto dealer will hire 15 salespeople.
Overall wages were flat, as a number of contacts noted that wages and   salaries at their companies were level with a year earlier. The University of   Minnesota's faculty senate recently approved a measure to cut pay temporarily   for most University employees by about 1 percent.
Price increases were moderate. Minnesota gasoline prices at the end of March   were up slightly from the end of February. However, copper and nickel prices   increased since the last report, as well as some prices for lumber and steel   products.
