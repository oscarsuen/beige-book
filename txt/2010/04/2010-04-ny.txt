The Second District's economy has strengthened noticeably since the last   report, though hiring remains sluggish; price pressures have increased   moderately but prices at the consumer level remain stable. Manufacturing-sector   contacts report improved activity. Auto dealers note some pickup in sales in   March, following a lull in February, while general merchandise retailers report   improving sales in both months. Tourism activity in New York City has   strengthened further since the last report. Commercial real estate markets have   been steady to slacker. Residential real estate markets, though still sluggish,   have shown scattered signs of improvement, especially at the lower end of the   market. Bankers report steady to weaker loan demand, higher delinquency rates   (except on consumer loans), and tighter credit standards.
Tourism activity in New York City has continued to strengthen since the last   report. Manhattan hotels report that business was relatively brisk in February   and that preliminary indications for March show even more strength: occupancy   rates have risen steadily and are estimated to be up 8 percentage points from a   year earlier in March, despite an increase in the overall number of hotel rooms.   Total revenue per room, which had been down more than 10 percent from a year   earlier in late 2009, was estimated to be up 6 percent in March. Similarly,   Broadway theaters report a noticeable pickup in business since the last report,   following a weather-related lull in early February: March revenues were up 16   percent from a year earlier, while attendance rose 9 percent. Separately, The   Conference Board reports that consumer confidence among residents of the Middle   Atlantic states (NY, NJ, Pa) slipped in February but rebounded in March, to just   below a two year high.
Manhattan's housing market remains sluggish, though there are signs of   stabilization, especially in the rental market. Co-op and condo sales   transactions were reported to have doubled in the first quarter from the   depressed levels of a year earlier but were still down modestly from the 4th   quarter of 2009. Prices were also down modestly for the quarter and continued to   run roughly 20 percent below a year earlier, with milder declines on studio and   1-bedroom apartments but steeper price drops on larger units. Manhattan's   apartment rental market showed further signs of stabilizing in March: rents   edged up and were down just 1Â½ percent from a year earlier, though vacancy rates   rose modestly.
Commercial real estate markets were steady to softer since the last report.   Manhattan's office vacancy rate continued to climb in the first quarter, though   at a more subdued pace than in 2009; asking rents for Class A properties   continued to run 20-25 percent lower than a year earlier. Still, a contact at a   major brokerage firm notes a pickup in leasing activity and sees signs of   stabilization in Midtown, though not in Downtown. Looking at the surrounding   areas, office vacancy rates continued to drift down in Long Island, were steady   in northern New Jersey, but continued to rise in Westchester and Fairfield   Counties. Asking rents were down moderately (3 to 6 percent) in these markets.   Office vacancy rates in most of upstate New York remain relatively stable--up a   bit in the Buffalo and Rochester areas but down modestly in the Albany area.   Asking rents are relatively steady in the Buffalo and Albany areas but down 3-8   percent from a year ago in metropolitan Rochester and down more steeply in the   Syracuse area. Industrial (factory and warehouse) markets slackened throughout   most of the District, with vacancy rates rising and rents falling. A real estate   developer in the Buffalo area notes that commercial development and construction   are increasingly sparse and that credit remains exceptionally tight.
Looking at business conditions more generally, contacts outside the   manufacturing sector continue to describe conditions as stable or rising   modestly. However, manufacturing contacts in the District note improved   conditions since the last report. A trucking-industry contact reports some   pickup in business in recent months, though conditions remain weak. There are   scattered reports of shortages of truck drivers--partly due to more stringent   requirements for commercial drivers' licenses.
