Business contacts around the District described economic activity as   improving in March and early April. Retailers saw an increase in traffic and   sales and their outlook improved. Auto sales increased on a year-over-year   basis, while revenues in the District's tourism segment were described as   stable. Residential real estate contacts indicated that both new and existing   home sales improved and were above weak levels from a year earlier. Commercial   contractors, on the other hand, continued to cite weakness in nonresidential   construction activity. District manufacturers noted further improvement in new   orders and production. The flow of bank credit to businesses remained subdued.   Permanent hiring remained weak. However, temporary help agencies noted an   increase in job orders. Manufacturers and homebuilders reported increases in   input prices but indicated that they were not able to pass them through to   consumers.
Tourism-related spending was described as stable in most parts of the   District. Contacts in Atlanta, Miami, Nashville, New Orleans, Orlando, and Tampa   all reported hotel occupancy rates above the national average from February to   March. Cruise lines noted increased demand and have unwound some earlier price   discounting. The near-term outlook among hospitality contacts remained generally   upbeat. However, corporate bookings remained at very low levels at some high-end   resorts.
Realtors indicated a slight improvement in existing home sales with nearly   half of those contacted reporting modest increases. Sales at the low-end of the   market continued to outpace those at higher price points. However, sales growth   at the low-end moderated from late-2009 levels, while mid- to high-end home   sales stabilized. Similar to comments from homebuilders, many Realtors also   noted that difficulty in obtaining financing was impeding home sales. Most   continued to cite downward pressure on home prices. The outlook for sales over   the next several months continued to be modestly positive.
Low levels of commercial construction continued across much of the District.   Most contractors described activity as relatively flat compared with previous   reports, and a few cited additional weakness. The volume of backlogs was little   changed but remained lower than a year ago. Most indicated that the demand for   new construction continued to be soft. Looking ahead, the majority of contacts   anticipated commercial construction will continue to be weak for the remainder   of the year.
District manufacturing and homebuilder contacts reported increases in   commodity-related material prices compared with a year ago, though prices   softened somewhat on a monthly basis. Several businesses expressed concern that   supply chain capacity reductions in some industries could lead to further input   price increases if product demand increased rapidly.
