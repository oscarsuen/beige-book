Economic activity has been uneven in recent weeks across the nation. Manufacturing increased moderately in most districts and showed no discernable direction in others, with considerable variation by industry. Retail sales also varied widely, but apparently rose modestly overall. Lower interest rates sparked another round of mortgage refinancing, but evidently provided little impetus to residential and commercial real estate activity. Consumer and business loan demand strengthened in only a few regions while remaining weak in most of the country. Agricultural conditions improved slightly as recent rains helped crops in many areas.
Consumer SpendingDistrict reports suggested that retail activity improved somewhat in recent weeks. Sales activity varied by product and region. Apparel sales were reported to be strong by New York and Kansas City, but weak by Philadelphia. New York and Kansas City also noted increased sales of home furnishings; Minneapolis and Atlanta indicated depressed appliance sales. Automobile sales evidently were weak in most districts except Atlanta and Dallas, where they were strong. Tourist activity was flat in the Richmond district but showed some strength in the Minneapolis district.
The expectations of retailers varied from district to district. Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas indicated that their contacts were optimistic about prospects for sales in the months ahead, while San Francisco said retailers were less optimistic than earlier this year. Survey respondents from the New York district were cautious but hopeful in their outlooks, and Cleveland reported retailer uncertainty about sales prospects. Retailers in the Boston district anticipated no substantial change in activity in the months immediately ahead.
Some industries performed better than others. Atlanta and Dallas noted strong gains in activity among apparel manufacturers and among producers of goods for residential construction. Boston and San Francisco reported weakness in defense-related and aerospace industries, but Boston found strength in demand among suppliers to the automobile industry.
Residential construction activity rose in the Chicago and Dallas districts, and in the San Francisco district outside of California. Homebuilding activity decreased in the St. Louis district and was generally unchanged in the Atlanta and Kansas City districts and in California. New York and Minneapolis indicated mixed activity in their districts.
Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas said that lower interest rates were not spurring home buying, although Chicago indicated that lower rates were helping. In the New York and Richmond districts, real estate agents mentioned that the job security concerns of potential home buyers were continuing to dampen sales.
Lower interest rates apparently had had little effect on commercial real estate loan activity. The demand for these leans was reported to be flat or down by Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco, and steady to somewhat higher by New York.
Lenders in the Philadelphia and Dallas districts expected loan demand to be flat over the next few months. Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago cited the continuing reluctance of bank customers, particularly businesses, to take on new debt.
Movements in farm prices varied. Crop prices were reported to be above last year's levels by Minneapolis but declining in the Dallas district. Livestock prices were lower in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City districts but stable in the Dallas district. Chicago indicated that milk prices were up.
Energy activity in the nation evidently continued to contract in recent weeks. The drilling rig count declined substantially in the Kansas City district, where activity was near historically low levels, but rose somewhat in the Dallas district. Oil industry respondents in the Dallas district indicated that they were cutting domestic exploration spending.
