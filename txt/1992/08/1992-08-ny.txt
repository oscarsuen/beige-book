Reports on District developments continued mixed in recent weeks. Department store sales results varied widely in June though most contacts reported better-than-expected gains. Office leasing activity showed some further improvement and several areas experienced a decline in vacancy rates. Conditions in the residential construction market have been somewhat mixed, however, and unemployment rates rose in June to their highest levels since the early 1980s. Most loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks noted no change in their willingness to lend but lackluster demand.
Despite unusually cool weather, demand for men's and women's clothing was strong and one chain experienced its best Father's Day week in four years. Furniture and other household items also sold well. As a result of the generally positive sales results, inventories at most department stores were on or somewhat below plan. With regard to the outlook, respondents were still fairly cautious though they were hopeful that visitors to New York's Columbus quincentennial celebration and the Democratic convention would provide a significant stimulus to July sales.
Residential Construction and Real EstateConditions in the residential construction market have been somewhat mixed in recent weeks. Homebuilders in two western and central New York areas reported a good response to this year's spring home shows with considerably better sales than a year earlier and some pickup in new orders as well. Sales were also off to a good start at a New Jersey site where 81 homes will soon rise. In other areas, however, activity was reportedly slow as consumers remained reluctant in response to continued layoffs and economic uncertainty.
Office leasing activity showed some further improvement as firms continued to avail themselves of lower rents and other concessions in order to upgrade their quarters. Several observers noted that, as commercial space is becoming more competitive with outside areas, some firms are canceling plans to relocate and opting to remain in the District instead. As a result of these developments several areas, including Long Island, northern New Jersey, Westchester County and mid-Manhattan, have experienced a recent decline in office vacancy rates, although these rates remain at high levels. A major exception was downtown Manhattan where firms moving to newer buildings marketed older space and the vacancy rate rose.
Most respondents reported no change in delinquency rates during the past two months. Virtually all officers reported lowering their deposit rates but noted there was no outflow of deposits. Rather, deposits generally shifted from maturing certificates of deposit into more liquid savings accounts, as customers avoided being locked into low long-term rates.
