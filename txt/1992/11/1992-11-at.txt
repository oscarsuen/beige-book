Tourism remains a bright spot in the Sixth District economy. Contacts reported that air passenger traffic, particularly international arrivals, is significantly above year-ago levels. Convention attendance has exceeded 1991 levels and industry contacts indicated that advanced bookings through mid-1993 offer the promise of another good year.
Although there has been a general lull in industrial production across the District, there are some exceptions. Producers of building supplies, carpeting, and other home furnishings have seen an increase in new orders as a result of the hurricane rebuilding effort. Apparel manufacturers have also reported increases in new orders and production for moderately priced goods, particularly denim products. However, rather than hiring new workers to meet higher production levels, most firms reported that they have simply increased the number of hours worked by existing employees.
Multifamily construction remains slow in most areas. Even though several contacts noted improvement in occupancy rates, effective rental rates remain too low to justify new building. Similarly, new commercial construction activity remains weak, with speculative office building close to zero.
In south Florida, realtors reported that the hurricane rebuilding effort is underway. According to contacts, a majority of activity is concentrated in residential construction, and some expect it to take up to three years to rebuild all destroyed homes. Contacts also reported that vacancy rates in Miami's central business district have fallen temporarily as firms have taken short-term leases while damaged facilities are repaired.
