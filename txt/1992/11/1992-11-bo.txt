First District business conditions have acquired a slightly more positive tone, according to contacts reached in the third week in October. Half the retail respondents report that sales in September and early October were flat compared with year-ago levels; for the rest, sales rose at a close-to-normal pace. The majority of manufacturing respondents also indicate that sales and orders were even with or slightly above year-ago figures. In most New England states, residential real estate markets have stabilized; prices are flat and volume is rising. Contacts in nonbank financial services report mixed trends, but most have seen increases in assets under management.
With no change in the cost of goods sold, retail contacts continue discounting to attract bargain-conscious consumers. Inventories remain closely monitored, but four respondents plan to expand the number of store locations. Employment is increasing only to staff new locations, while wages are unchanged or rising modestly.
ManufacturingDemand for manufactured goods has been mixed in recent months. the majority of respondents report changes in sales and orders compared to a year earlier ranging from zero to 7 percent. A couple had significantly batter results, while others experienced declining demand. Sales of electronics and some housing-related products increased. Sales of automotive products were highly variable, while those for aircraft and defense goods declined. Markets in Japan and Europe (especially the United Kingdom) were described as weak, although several manufacturers report doing quite well overseas because of gains in market share.
Manufacturing contacts report that their selling prices range from below to very slightly above year-ago levels. Increased input prices for paper, rubber, some chemicals, and imported goods have put pressure on margins for some companies.
About half the respondents have cut U.S. employment in the past year, by up to 16 percent. At the others, employment has been increasing, by as much as 5 percent. Capital spending was most often described as flat, and has been concentrated in cost-reducing or efficiency-improving equipment.
On balance, manufacturers expressed cautious optimism about the economy over the next year. Most project 1993 to be similar to or slightly better than 1992. Respondents indicate concern over weakness in foreign economies and dampened consumer confidence in the United States. Positive factors include a pent-up consumer demand for autos and housing and improved business and household balance sheets.
