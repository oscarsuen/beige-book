Economic activity has continued to increase in most of the districts, but at a slow and uneven pace. Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas all reported some improvement, ranging from a slightly more positive tone in Boston to a modest expansion in St. Louis. Developments in New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco were described as mixed, with improvement in some sectors and sluggishness in others. Retail sales grew in most districts though the extent of the gain varied. Activity in the manufacturing sector apparently lost some momentum in much of the nation as several districts noted a slower pace of expansion or declining demand. An improvement in residential construction and sales was noted in several districts, with gains generally concentrated in the low-to-middle-income range of single-family housing. Several districts have reported a slight increase in overall loan demand. Cool and damp weather continued to delay harvests in much of the nation although yields on many crops were very good. The few reports received this time on wage and price developments referred to generally stable conditions, though with scattered price increases reported on a few individual items.
Mining has been lackluster in Minneapolis with low prices for gold and copper and slack demand for iron ore. Aluminum production remains high in California despite sharply falling prices but the output of forest products continues low. The surge in domestic demand for plywood resulting from recent hurricane damage has apparently subsided and shipments to Japan and other Pacific Basin countries remain down.
