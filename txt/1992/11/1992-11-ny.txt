Developments in the Second District since the last report remained basically mixed. Most contacts at District department stores reported stronger-than-planned sales in September and positive over-the-year changes. Moreover, office leasing activity showed some improvement as firms continue to avail themselves of lower rents and other concessions in order to upgrade their quarters. The residential construction market was mixed, however, with homebuilders in upstate New York reporting somewhat stronger buying interest than those in downstate communities. New York's unemployment rate rose in September while New Jersey's fell following August declines in both states. The latest Buffalo and Rochester purchasing managers' reports were less favorable than earlier. Most senior loan officers at small and midsized banks indicated no change in their willingness to lend.
Year-to-year sales increases in September generally ranged from 4 to 16 percent. One chain reported a smaller-than-expected over-the-year decrease. Categories registering the greatest improvement were sports apparel, outerwear and bed and bath items. Inventories are reportedly in good shape-either on plan or a little below.
Office leasing activity showed some improvement as firms continue to avail themselves of lower rents and other concessions in order to upgrade their quarters. In addition, most areas report little or no new office space under construction at this time. As a result of these developments, several areas, including Long Island, Fairfield and Westchester counties and mid-Manhattan, have experienced a recent decline in office vacancy rates, although they remain at high levels.
The September survey of Buffalo purchasing managers showed much smaller percentages of firms reporting a rise in new orders and production following substantial improvements in these categories during August. The latest survey of Rochester purchasing managers also showed a sizable drop in the percentage anticipating an improvement in business conditions over the next three months.
A majority of respondents noted that overall loan demand remained sluggish. Largely due to refinancing activity, demand for residential mortgages continued to increase and consumer loan demand improved slightly. However, demand for commercial and industrial loans and nonresidential mortgages weakened. Almost all respondents reported either maintaining or lowering interest rates. A majority of officers indicated that delinquency rates for residential mortgages and commercial and industrial loans were unchanged to slightly lower during the preceding two months.
