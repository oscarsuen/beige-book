The Ninth District economy improved slightly in early fall following essentially steady to slower conditions in late summer. Weather threats to crops did not materialize and Ninth District directors report good cash returns in agriculture. They also report that the 1992 summer tourist season was strong. Retail chains reported stronger sales. Construction is also an area of tentative strengthening, particularly in infrastructure such as street and sewer improvements. Motor vehicle sales, however, are essentially steady and manufacturing and mining are slow. Labor markets appear to have stabilized.
Motor vehicle sales essentially match sales a year ago. Year-to-date figures for a major domestic distributor show car sales down 2 percent from 1991 but pickup trucks up 4 percent. South Dakota new vehicle titles issued in September and year to date were essentially unchanged from 1991.
The summer tourist season ended on an upbeat note. Directors, an industry association and newspapers report that the season had been "good" to "excellent" in all areas. Sources in South Dakota and Montana rated the season as excellent, though down slightly from records set in 1991. Early news reports from the Upper Peninsula note expectations of favorable game populations and weather conditions leading to good hunting-related business for the fall season.
Home sales are reported strong in most metropolitan areas. Eau Claire, Wis., and Rapid City, S.D., reported 1992 housing starts 17 percent and 35 percent above 1991 respectively. Duluth, Minn., was an exception, reporting a construction slump and sluggish sales.
Despite these encouraging reports, Minnesota's construction employment declined slightly in September as several major projects were completed, according to employment service officials.
Mining is lackluster, with low prices for gold and copper limiting profitability in South Dakota and Montana and slack demand for iron ore affecting northern Minnesota. A major gold mine in western South Dakota announced plans to scale back production and offer early retirement to 132 workers.
Livestock profitability was generally unchanged to slightly lower. Prices for slaughter livestock were marginally lower compared to the same period in 1991. September dairy prices were higher than in 1991, while poultry and eggs were largely unchanged. Prices for feeder livestock in Montana and the western Dakotas were strong.
With the exception of localized areas affected by frost, hail or drought, agricultural bankers responding to a quarterly survey of agricultural credit conditions reported that farmers generally were able to service their operating loans and continue with debt retirement. Directors noted that investment in new machinery was largely limited to new harvesting machinery needed to cope with the late, unfavorable harvest conditions. Some ranching areas of west-central South Dakota are extremely dry and much of Montana's pasture and range continue below normal condition, but soil moisture in nearly all crop-producing areas of the region is excellent going into the winter.
