Convention traffic in most states is exceeding year-ago levels and is expected to remain strong into next year. Tourism enjoyed moderate increases through late summer, bolstered by the air fare wars and an influx of European visitors responding to sharp declines in the dollar.
However, firms that rely on NASA or defense contracts reported decreasing orders and are not optimistic about the outlook over the next six months. Petroleum industry suppliers stated that the energy business remains slow.
The extent of damage to oil and gas platforms off the Louisiana coast is still being assessed. According to most recent reports, about 200 installations show storm-related losses. Decisions regarding restoration of the most seriously damaged structures are pending. Natural gas prices, which had already been trending upward, were pushed sharply higher by the interruption in supply.
In Florida, the lime, avocado, mango, and foliage plant crops were all severely damaged or destroyed. It will take several years to establish new production for many of the tree crops. Salt water intrusion into fields may delay planting of the winter vegetable crop. However, except for limes, fruit and vegetable prices have remained relatively stable as lost supplies have been displaced by imports. In Louisiana, 25 percent of the sugarcane crop was destroyed. The fishing and shrimping industries were also disrupted, and oyster harvesting has been suspended pending pollution test results. Although the affected areas may experience a net gain in jobs and income for one to two years, the stimulus from rebuilding activity is ultimately transitory and is not expected to displace the loss in agricultural and personal wealth incurred by large uninsured losses.
