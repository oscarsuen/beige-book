Economic activity in the Third District appeared to edge up slightly in August and early September, according to reports from area businesses. Manufacturers noted continued gains, on balance, with increases in orders and shipments. Retailers generally indicated that sales picked up in late August and early September from the summer pace although the year-over-year increase was slight. Bankers said loan volume outstanding has been virtually steady in recent weeks, with business lending flat, and gains in residential mortgage lending offset by declines in consumer installment lending. Realtors indicated that home sales continued to exceed last year's rate, but demand for office space remained weak.
Looking ahead, Third District business contacts expect little change from current trends. Manufacturers expect orders and shipments to continue to rise. Retailers forecast a seasonal increase in sales for the fall but only a small year-over-year gain. Bankers generally expect little or no growth in overall lending in the months immediately ahead.
Looking ahead, a majority of Third District manufacturers expect business to remain on an upward trend through the coming winter. On balance, they plan to step up shipments and they anticipate an increase in orders that will boost backlogs. Employment increases are planned by approximately one-third of the firms contacted while half intend to maintain current payrolls.
In general, Third District retail executives expect sales to move up seasonally through the fall, but they anticipate only a modest increase for the period compared to last year. While several merchants said they planned expanded advertising and promotional campaigns for the balance of the year, they do not appear to be boosting sales plans. Most said they will attempt to keep inventories lean.
Area bankers anticipate little growth in lending ahead. Some speculate that consolidations and restructurings by business firms are resulting in fundamental reductions in their credit needs and that a significant increase in business borrowing will not occur until a trend of strong economic growth is well under way. Consumer loan demand will pick up, according to bankers, with a resumption of growth in employment and income.
Demand for office space remains weak, according to commercial realtors. They estimate that vacancy rates this summer reached about 16 percent in central Philadelphia and varied from 13 to 27 percent in suburban areas. Realtors said ongoing consolidation by local companies is continuing to reduce demand for office space. Older buildings are especially vulnerable to declining demand, according to realtors; they estimate that the vacancy rate in Class B buildings is about 22 percent and that rents are being reduced from 10 to 40 percent depending on the age and condition of the building.
