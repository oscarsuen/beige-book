Economic activity remains sluggish in the First District as both retailers and manufacturers await recovery. Most retailers contacted in mid-September experienced a mid-year lull after sales rose in the first quarter. Auto sales show no improvement, but housing activity has increased. Most manufacturing respondents report that sales and orders are equal to or slightly above 1991 levels, but a significant minority add that incoming business has weakened in recent weeks.
The cost of goods to retailers and prices offered consumers remain unchanged with one exception. Lumber prices are said to have risen significantly in response to heightened demand from areas hit by Hurricane Andrew.
Retailers still exercise tight control over inventories, although some indicated greater willingness to allow stocks to expand as declines in interest rates have lessened carrying costs. One-third of those contacted plan major increases in capital spending, while others report no change. Similarly, only one-third plan to expand employment; others will continue to reduce it by attrition. Retailers do not foresee any near-term change in prevailing conditions.
Representatives of the Boston-area tourism industry report that visitor totals and the foreign share were above last summer's levels. Although hotel occupancy rates are up, room charges have not changed for over two years. Contacts attribute Boston's increased traffic to exceptionally cool weather and the Tall Ships; thus, these gains may have come at the expense of the region' s resort areas.
Since few manufacturers can count on significant sales growth, they report continuing efforts to cut costs and improve profits. Accordingly, they are keeping inventories tight and capital spending modest. In most cases, capital spending is equal to or below 1991 levels, and two contacts have delayed capital projects. Employment levels are generally flat to down from the beginning of the year, with declines ranging up to 10 percent. Almost half of the firms expect employment to continue to fall.
Input prices are generally stable; despite ongoing efforts, manufacturers are finding it increasingly difficult to wring price concessions from suppliers. The manufacturers' sales prices are flat to down, with low-end products priced aggressively and high-end products more stable. A minority have succeeded in raising selected prices.
While one manufacturer is more upbeat than at any time in the past two years, several describe themselves as more pessimistic than they were in early 1992. Most contacts expect little change from current near-stagnant conditions. They attribute the "anemic" pace of GDP growth to business reluctance to spend ahead of the recovery.
