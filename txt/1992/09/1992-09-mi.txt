Late summer economic conditions in the Ninth District were steady after slight declines reported in the previous Beige Book. General merchandise, auto and home sales show signs of strength. Tourism was reported to be strong. Construction is running above last year's levels. These positive factors are offset to some extent by weak labor markets, with layoffs in manufacturing and mining reported in late August and early September. Finally, cold, wet weather threatens District crop production.
Further signs of strength include a regional electronics retailer reporting August year-to-date sales 15 percent above the same period in 1991. Sporting goods stores in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan towns of Ishpeming and Marquette report late summer sales 10 to 20 percent above last year. Minnesota sales tax remittances for August are reported to be "as projected,"  somewhat above levels a year earlier.
Automobile sales are strong, with new car titles issued in Minnesota in August up 13 percent over 1991. A manufacturer reported that year-to-date car sales were even with 1991 but that truck and pickup sales were up substantially.
In spite of unusually cool weather, the summer tourist season was reported to be good. Montana experienced a very strong season with visits at 14 top attractions, including Yellowstone and Glacier national parks, running 7 percent above 1991's rates. In South Dakota, tourism was reported to be down slightly from the previous year, but still rated as "great" by an official of an industry association. Crossings of the Mackinac and Sault Ste. Marie bridges ran above 1991 levels.
But these expansions are offset to some extent by recent layoffs. About 100 employees of a paper mill in Ladysmith, Wis., were laid off in a permanent closure. Other layoffs included tractor manufacturing workers in Fargo, N.D., and computer assemblers in Minneapolis/St. Paul.
Recent layoffs also trouble the mining sector. Some 760 workers were laid off at an Eveleth, Minn., taconite mine triggering furloughs for 50 railroad workers. Montana gold mining is reported to be slow. Coal shipments from Duluth-Superior for this year are down 20 percent relative to 1991, due to reduced demand at generating plants in the Detroit area.
