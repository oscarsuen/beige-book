The latest developments in the District remained basically mixed but marginally more positive than in other recent months. Most department store contacts said sales were better than expected in July, and on or better-than plan in August. Office leasing activity continued at a moderate pace and the vacancy rate in midtown Manhattan declined, though the downtown rate edged higher. While still at high levels, District unemployment rates fell in August after increasing in July and reports from purchasing managers in Buffalo showed substantial improvement in both production and new orders. Conditions in the residential construction market remained mixed. Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks noted no change in their willingness to lend but said that demand continued lackluster.
Demand for women's and men's apparel was strong in both July and August and new fall styles and fabrics were said to have sold particularly well. Several contacts stated that the unusually cool summer may have been conducive to trying on and buying for the fall and winter since outerwear items also sold briskly. Respondents were generally satisfied with their inventory levels which, for the most part, are on plan or slightly below. Contacts are cautiously optimistic about some modest sales improvement in upcoming months.
Office leasing activity continued at a moderate pace since the last report and the vacancy rate on commercial buildings in midtown Manhattan declined. Downtown, however, the rate on primary buildings edged higher as downsizing at financial institutions continued. With the City's vacancy rates remaining at high levels, plans to construct four new office towers as part of the redevelopment of the Times Square area have recently been put on indefinite hold. Instead, the area is to be revitalized and renovated with major tourist attractions and retail establishments.
All respondents reported either maintaining or lowering loan rates. A majority of officers indicated that delinquency rates on mortgages and commercial and industrial loans have not changed during the past two months. Although deposits continue to shift from maturing certificates of deposit into more liquid savings accounts, the trend was not as prevalent among surveyed banks as two months ago.
