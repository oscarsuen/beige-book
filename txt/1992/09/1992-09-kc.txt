District cattle feeders have held down inventories, providing support for cattle prices despite a surge in supplies of pork and poultry. Meanwhile, district cattle ranchers continue to enjoy excellent pasture conditions due to the district's abundant rainfall.
The abundant rainfall in recent weeks has also been generally beneficial for district crops. In Kansas and Missouri, above-average yields of corn, silo, and soybeans are likely. But in parts of Oklahoma and Nebraska, heavy rains and hail have damaged crops. Adequate soil moisture will encourage timely planting and development of winter wheat in the district.
The repayment rate of many farm operating loans hinges on when wheat farmers sell this year's crop. Some farmers sold their wheat shortly after harvest and used the sale proceeds to reduce loan balances. But a recent uptick in wheat prices--after a long decline since the beginning of the year--has encouraged many wheat growers to delay selling their grain in anticipation of further price gains. As a result, the pace of loan repayment has slowed.
