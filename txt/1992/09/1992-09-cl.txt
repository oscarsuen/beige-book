Auto sources were disappointed by the unexpected drop in new car sales in July and by a further decline in August. They report that dealers have recently cut orders below sales in order to prevent an unwanted buildup of new car inventories.
Shipments of major household appliances in July and August showed larger year-to-year gains than in preceding months, according to a producer. Nevertheless, not much more additional growth is anticipated during the balance of this year because of a flattening in housing starts since spring.
Near-term growth in manufacturing output may be restrained because of spottiness in auto output. Auto sources forecast that the annual rate of production in the fourth quarter will remain about unchanged from the third-quarter rate, even if the production loss of GMC is fully made up. They are concerned that dealer orders have been running below sales recently.
Steel producers anticipate little change in production over the next few months from the present 80% operating rate. According to one source, September orders are rebounding from the summer slowdown in July and August, but the pace of new orders for October and November is slower than expected.
District suppliers to the aerospace industry note that cutbacks in defense purchases as well as deferment of orders for commercial aircraft are dampening their orders and backlogs.
Manufacturers indicate that inventories continue to be lean. Some are adding slightly, while others are still cutting stocks as a result of improving operating and inventory techniques. Industry sources anticipate continued intensive use of their existing work force, and do not expect either layoffs or worker recalls in the near term.
New housing starts in Ohio may be off a little in the third quarter from the second, according to a building official, with wide variations within the state. Building contracts in the high-growth area of Columbus sustained their strong pace through most of the third quarter. In Cleveland, however, a large builder of higher-priced, single-family housing reports a sag in consumer traffic and buying during August and early September, which, if continued, will result in layoffs. Home remodeling contractors, however, are said to be operating at capacity.
Bankers note recent declines in consumer installment credit and slower growth in credit card usage. Home equity loans are the major source of loan expansion, according to several lenders.
Some depositories have made further interest-rate cuts on deposits and mortgage loans in recent weeks.
