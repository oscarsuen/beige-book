Cutbacks continue to occur in the defense industry. In particular, a St. Louis-based defense contractor announced its consolidation of six divisions into two, eliminating 170 St. Louis jobs immediately. The jobs of 7.000 St. Louis employees of this firm, however, became more secure with an announcement by the President of his support for the firm's aircraft sale to a foreign buyer. Unrelated to defense, a plant manufacturing jeans in northwestern Mississippi will close this month, releasing 550 employees.
A recent survey of Eighth District firms reveals that almost half of those surveyed experienced no change in sales during the second quarter and do not expect to change their inventory levels during the third quarter. In an unrelated survey by a temporary employment agency, half of the Memphis firms surveyed indicate that they will increase employment in the fourth quarter of 1992, a proportion more than double the national average.
