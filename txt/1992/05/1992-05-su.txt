According to contacts across the country, economic activity has increased further since the last survey although conditions remain uneven across regions and sectors. The Chicago, Atlanta, Richmond, and Cleveland districts report noticeable improvement, while the Dallas, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Minneapolis districts report continued moderate rates of economic expansion. The San Francisco, New York, Boston and Philadelphia districts report continued sluggish economic activity. These districts, however, report either slightly improved conditions or increased optimism about the near-term outlook.
Manufacturing activity has picked up in most regions of the country. Continued growth in residential construction has been widespread. Many districts report gains in retail sales. Several regions, however, report continued declines in commercial construction, energy extraction and defense manufacturing. While the demand for non-mortgage loans generally is reported as weak, there has been some pickup in demand for these loans in several regions. Producer and consumer prices are reported as generally stable.
Respondents in the Atlanta and Dallas districts report strong gains in manufacturing industries tied to residential construction and moderate gains in industries such as apparel, paper and electronics. However, the manufacturing gains in the Dallas district have been offset somewhat by continued declines in energy-related industries such as oil field equipment. The San Francisco and Boston districts note continued weakness in defense-related manufacturing.
The energy sector continues to decline. Oil and natural gas prices remain at low levels, and the drilling rig count continues to fall. Oil and gas industry respondents in the Atlanta district report that business activity continues to decline and that further layoffs are likely over the next few months. St. Louis reports that year-to-date coal production has declined about 6 percent from a year earlier.
