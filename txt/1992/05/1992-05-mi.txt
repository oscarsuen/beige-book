The District continued to show modest signs of recovery. Labor market conditions generally strengthened. Consumer spending showed substantial signs of improvement with retail sales doing fairly well, auto and truck sales picking up, and home sales showing a strong upsurge. Conditions in the District's manufacturing sector remained even, while those in the construction sector show signs of improving. Conditions in the resource-related industries were mixed.
Our Directors report that wage and price pressures have generally been modest around the District. One exception continues to be the rising cost of health care. Recently, the state of Minnesota enacted a health rights bill. This bill, besides providing broad insurance coverage to 400,000 presently uninsured citizens, attempts to limit price increases for medical services.
New car and truck sales continued above their year-ago levels in the District. However, the recent strike of mechanics at unionized car dealerships in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area has dealers concerned that this may keep some buyers away. Dealers' reports on year-to-date sales of new trucks relative to a year ago range from even to 10 percent higher. New car sales also have improved in the District. One major manufacturer reported that sales in the region set a record in March. Dealers reports of new car sales in the District during the first 10 days of April relative to their year-ago levels ranged from even to 20 percent higher, with year-to-date sales reported to range from slightly below to 2 percent above their year-ago levels.
Home sales continue to improve in the District. March sales of existing single-family homes in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area were up 23 percent over a year ago. The Twin Cities year-to-date sales figure is 36 percent above its year-ago level.
We are between seasons in the tourist industry, though the general positive trend we have been reporting appears to be continuing. Crossings over the Mackinac Bridge onto the Upper Peninsula of Michigan established a new record for the month of March, and the total number of crossings in the first quarter of 1992 were up 7 percent from a year ago. The NCAA basketball Final Four tournament brought an estimated $40 million to the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.
Conditions were generally steady to improving in the District's manufacturing sector. The February level of average weekly hours in manufacturing in Minnesota of 40.4 was slightly higher than its year-ago level of 39.8, but down 1/10th of a percent from the previous month. The February level of Minnesota's average hourly earnings in manufacturing was 4 percent higher than a year ago. Employment levels in manufacturing were unchanged in February relative to a year ago in Minnesota and Montana, down 1 percent in North Dakota, and up 7 percent in South Dakota.
The lumber industry continues to decline due to a shortage of trees available for harvesting, particularly on public land. Minnesota is expected to sell only half to one-third of its normal amount of timber. Nonetheless, saw mills are managing to acquire sufficient lumber to maintain operations. The recent trade levy on Canadian lumber along with the upsurge in housing construction has raised prices.
Production in the District's mining industry is largely unchanged from a year ago, though copper production is reported to have risen. Prices have weakened with regard to certain minerals such as taconite and gold.
