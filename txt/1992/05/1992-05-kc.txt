Most automobile dealers continue to expand inventories in anticipation of further increases in sales in the next few months.
Deposits were up or constant at most banks over the last month. Demand deposits were mostly up, while NOW, super-NOW, and money market deposit accounts were mostly up or constant. At most banks, IRA and Keogh accounts and small time and savings deposits were constant. At nearly all banks large CDs were down.

Thus, many feedlots are operating below capacity and carefully avoiding a buildup of fed cattle inventories.

In most of the district, last year's dip in farm incomes appears to have taken the steam out of the farmland market. But farm rents have edged up in isolated areas, suggesting some possible gains in farmland prices.
