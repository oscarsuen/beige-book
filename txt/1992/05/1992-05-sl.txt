Despite the recovery, layoffs and closings continue to occur throughout the District. A food producing plant in Evansville, Indiana, announced its closing within the next year, eliminating 300 jobs. A St. Louis defense contractor laid off another 155 workers after cuts of more than 11,000 in the last one and one-half years. A maker of bathtubs and sinks, employing 345 workers, is closing its Louisville factory by year's end because of dwindling product demand. An Arkansas plastics company closed last month, eliminating more than 200 jobs. Because of bankruptcy by some of its major customers and its own heavy indebtedness, a children's clothing manufacturer in Kentucky will close in June and eliminate 310 jobs. The effects of this closure may be more than offset, however, by this winter's opening of a cookie and cracker maker in the same town bringing 500 jobs.
