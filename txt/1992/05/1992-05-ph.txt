Economic conditions in the Third District during April appeared to be just steady overall, although there were some signs of improvement. Positive indications came from manufacturers, who generally noted a second consecutive month of growth in both shipments and orders, and realtors, who reported that home sales were picking up and prices were firming. A weaker situation appeared to prevail in retailing; most Third District merchants contacted for this report experienced a drop in sales in March and April compared to January and February. In the financial sector, bankers generally described total loan volume as flat.
The outlook in the Third District business community is generally positive, albeit restrained. Manufacturers expect continued improvement and they are planning modest increases in hiring and capital spending. Retailers hope for a rebound in the second half of the year, but they expect only slow growth once a recovery in sales gets underway. Bankers forecast moderate gains in lending in the second half, primarily to businesses as capital spending is stepped up. Realtors anticipate sustained improvement in residential markets provided mortgage rates do not continue to rise, but they expect commercial markets to remain weak for some time to come.
Nearly two-thirds of the manufacturers polled for this report predict continued improvement over the next six months. On balance, they forecast gains in shipments and new orders; they also expect order backlogs, which have been stable, to increase. While approximately half of the firms queried said they would hold employment and capital spending level over the next two quarters, more than one-third plan to add workers and more than one-fourth are scheduling increased capital expenditures during the period.
The consensus forecast among Third District retailers is that recovery will be slow and erratic. While some look for the beginning of an upturn in the third quarter, others believe solid improvement will not take hold until next year. In the meantime, store executives indicated they will be focusing their attention on cost-cutting, including employment reductions.
Auto dealers also experienced a sales slowdown in March and April. On balance, they expect unit sales for this year as a whole to just match last year's results.
Commercial and industrial real estate markets did not appear to be sharing the improving health noted in residential markets. Demand for industrial and retail space was described as particularly weak by brokers. Commercial brokers continued to describe the market for office space as soft although some noted that vacancy rates were declining in some areas.
Construction activity, overall, appeared to be flat. While some slight gains were indicated in residential and public construction, commercial building activity remained at a low level.
