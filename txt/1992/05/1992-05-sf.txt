In southern California, the slump in ad revenue and circulation has claimed one of only two daily Spanish-language newspapers in Los Angeles. One media contact reports that employment and real estate ads are down 11 and 19 percent, respectively, from their weak year-earlier levels. Auto advertising, however, shows an increase of 9 percent over the previous year. Circulation and help wanted advertisements in Oregon and the Puget Sound area have begun to show modest gains.
