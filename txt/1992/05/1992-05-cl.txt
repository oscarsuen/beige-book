In the Fourth District, a more positive outlook is also apparent in view of better-than-expected profits last quarter and the renewed strength in orders, housing, and retail sales. Purchasing agents in Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati report that gains in manufacturing activity during February and March were as strong as or stronger than in the nation.
Economists associated with consumer goods expect that real consumer spending in the second quarter will increase at about a 2% annual rate. Most believe that the recovery in consumer spending will be more lasting than the revival last spring because of pent-up demand and improving household balance sheets, but still do not see much sign of a pickup in auto demand this season.
Most of the Big Three auto dealers contacted were more positive about the spring selling season, while dealers of Japanese nameplate vehicles were less upbeat than in our previous survey. Sales of most of the Big Three dealers have been relatively stronger in recent weeks, partly reflecting another round of price increases for Japanese cars.
Economists associated with the automotive industry estimate that new car sales and production will improve this quarter from last, and that the industry will be a small contributor to overall output. Nevertheless, temporary layoffs may continue this quarter because of excess stocks of specific models or because of model changeovers, according to auto sources.
Capital goods producers are more optimistic about recovery because of' the quickened pace of new orders last quarter. A producer of small motors and electrical equipment notes a long-awaited pickup in new orders last quarter. A machine tool builder reports total orders last quarter were well above those a year earlier, despite a slide in export business, and order backlogs have been rising for the last several months. A midsize producer of plastic products machinery states that sales rose at a double-digit rate last quarter from depressed conditions during most of 199l, and profits of an industrial equipment producer soared on the strength of a rising trend in domestic orders. Heavy-duty truck orders rose sharply in February and March, and inquiries since then suggest another goodmonth in April. Consequently, truck production is expected to rise steadily each quarter this year, according to a major supplier. Recovery for specialized industrial controls apparently began last December, according to a producer who believes that customers are gradually adding to capacity rather than simply ordering for maintenance. A small producer of metal castings is considering hiring more employees in response to a recent strengthening in business, and a small producer of electrical motors and parts for the mass transit industry reports a surge in both orders and profits last quarter.
Economists associated with capital goods industries expect that real investment in producers' goods will increase at annual rates at least 5% to 7% quarterly from this quarter through the balance of the year because of revival in traditional capital goods industries.
