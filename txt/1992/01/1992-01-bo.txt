Economic activity continues at a low level in the First District. For most retailers, Christmas sales were even with last year's. Manufacturing demand remains weak, with sales and orders below year-ago levels at most firms contacted. Manufacturers' employment continues to decline, and capital spending plans are restrained. Few firms expect any improvement before mid-year.
Although some retailers offered large discounts early in the season, prices have now stabilized. A few merchants with especially strong market positions passed some cost increases on to consumers. Most continue to maintain strict control over inventory. In general, both margins and profits are flat.
All contacts undertook routine seasonal hiring, but plan no changes in permanent employment. Wage increases are minimal. With few exceptions, capital spending plans are severely limited. Preserving liquidity reportedly has priority over large investment commitments since consumer spending remains erratic and competition intense. Few foresee a substantial improvement in their business in the new year.
Manufacturers' sales prices are generally flat to down. Most contacts are offering discounts on their weakest lines or across the board. In turn, respondents are seeking price concessions from their own suppliers. Still, several report pinched margins, only partially relieved by productivity gains. To contain costs, two-thirds of the respondents have reduced employment from year-ago levels, either through layoffs or attrition. Almost half are planning or considering further cuts. No firm expects to expand its work force any time soon.
One-third of the respondents plan to increase capital spending in 1992 by as much as 10 percent. For the rest, investment will be equal to or less than year-ago efforts. In explaining their restrained investment plans, almost half point out that they have adequate or excess capacity. Others mention concerns about cash flow or onerous debt levels. While lower interest rates reduce the cost of carrying this debt, no contact indicates that interest rate cuts will lead his firm to make additional investments in the near term. A few contacts hope that such cuts will prompt their customers to do so, however.
A majority of manufacturing contacts expect no improvement in economic activity before the second half of 1992. A few hope for a pickup in the third quarter in response to lower interest rates; others express faith in election-year fiscal initiatives. Even so, most expect very slow growth over the medium term.
