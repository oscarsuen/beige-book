The District's economy has been largely stagnant lately. Labor market conditions generally deteriorated. Retail sales increases were modest, except in those areas that continue to benefit from the influx of Canadian shoppers. New auto sales remain weak, though truck sales have rebounded sharply. Construction and manufacturing conditions were mixed. Agriculture did well, with high crop yields offsetting price declines. Tourism has remained strong.
New truck sales surged in December with some dealers reporting sales increases of 83 percent in December relative to a year ago. However, year-to-date truck sales were still 9 to 13 percent below last year's level. New car sales in the District improved in December, but continue to be weak, with local dealers of domestic cars reporting year-to-date sales declines ranging from 20 to 25 percent, while foreign car dealers reported flat year-to-date sales in October. Used car sales continue to be strong.
Housing sales improved in the District. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, housing sales were up 13 percent in the fourth quarter, and 3.8 percent year-to-date. This was despite the fact that sales fell slightly in December relative to the previous month, and were essentially unchanged from their year-ago level.
Tourist activity has been excellent in the District. Yellowstone National Park had its best year ever. Total bridge crossings onto the Upper Peninsula of Michigan this year have been above their year-ago levels, with crossings over the Mackinac and International bridges in November and December up 4.8 percent and down 0.3 percent, respectively, relative to their year-ago levels. The upcoming Super Bowl is expected to bring $45-$50 million in direct expenditures to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Heavy early snow fall got the skiing and snowmobiling seasons off to a good start, but the lack of recent snow has slowed winter recreation considerably.
Conditions were mixed in the District's manufacturing industries. In Minnesota, average weekly hours at 40.8 in November were slightly higher than their year and month-ago level of 40.5. In contrast, Minnesota's November average hourly earnings were up only 2.8 percent relative to a year ago.
Mining conditions have been mixed in the District. Copper prices are holding firm, but oil and molybdenum prices remain low. The lumber and wood products market is mixed, with problems due to environmental issues anticipated in the near future.
