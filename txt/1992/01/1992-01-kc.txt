Auto sales declined slightly in the district over the last month. Some potential buyers still find it difficult to get loans due to tighter credit standards. While automobile dealers expect sales to begin picking up in the next few months, most of them are still trimming inventories.
Most district thrift institutions report deposit outflows during recent months. Respondents expect outflows to continue at a steady pace over coming months because of low rates on deposits. Mortgage rates have dropped at least 100 basis points over the past three months but are expected to level off in coming months. Mortgage demand and commitments are strong due largely to refinancing. Respondents expect mortgage demand to remain strong during coming months, due to both refinancing and new home purchases.
All respondents reduced their prime rates last month and almost all expect to leave these rates unchanged in the near future. More than half of the respondents also reduced their consumer lending rates last month, and a few expect to lower rates further in the near future. Lending standards were unchanged.
Deposits increased at most reporting banks. Increases in demand deposits, NOW accounts, and MMDAs outweighed decreases in large CDs and small time deposits.
Yearend credit reviews for district farm borrowers showed little change from a year ago in the number of problem loans. But credit reviews did reveal a growing disparity between livestock and crop borrowers. Bankers report that some livestock producers struggled to repay loans as cattle and hog prices slumped in the last half of 1991, while crop farmers benefited from rising wheat prices. Bankers expect the divergence in crop and livestock incomes to continue in 1992. Nevertheless, bankers expect only a slight increase in problem loans overall.
Bankers expect farm loan demand to be steady in 1992. Demand for livestock loans may fall, while demand for wheat operating loans may edge up as farmers take advantage of higher wheat prices. A few banks report increased demand for real estate loans as nonfarm investors move funds our of certificates of deposits to purchase farmland.
