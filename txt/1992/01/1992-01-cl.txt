At year-end 1991, inventories were larger than desired by some retailers. They generally have shaved their sales goals for the spring months, but uniformly expect a stronger second half than first half of 1992.
According to economists associated with consumer goods industries, real consumer spending last quarter rose between zero and a 1% annual rate, and is expected to rise between a 1% and 2% annual rate this quarter. There is little support among them for a temporary cut in personal income taxes to stimulate spending.
Auto dealers in the District are a little more optimistic about short-term sales prospects than they have been in recent months, because their December sales improved from November and from a year earlier. That helped to cut some of their excess inventories, and most dealers contacted now expect that they will slightly increase their factory orders this quarter from last.
Several capital goods producers report a softening in orders in the past month or two following a revival that began last spring. The upturn in heavy-duty truck output flattened in recent months after several months of irregular but rising activity, according to a supplier. The daily average of orders for an industrial equipment producer in December fell after a steady climb through November. Customer inventories are believed to be low, however, because orders have been more frequent but smaller. A parts supplier to the office machinery industry reported a further rise in orders through last quarter. He expects that spending for real producers' durable equipment last quarter rose at about a 5% annual rate, led by the computer and aerospace industries, with most other capital goods industries showing little change from the previous quarter.
Manufacturers in general do not anticipate an increase in their capital spending in 1992 from 1991, although spending plans vary widely by industry. Some producers expect higher outlays this year, particularly for equipment, to improve product quality, broaden product lines, and increase productivity. Some plan less spending this year than last because of cutbacks in business structures. A tool producer plans a step-up in spending this year for further modernization of existing facilities. Although the primary metals industry is apparently anticipating some cutback in spending this year, a producer plans a large capital expenditure for quality and cost improvement. A mineral resources producer expects his firm and industry to cut back spending in 1992 because of prospects for weak prices for their products.
Capital spending plans are not being delayed, although some may be stretched out, and discussion of a possible tax change is not yet affecting spending plans. A common view among manufacturers seems to be that an investment tax credit, although less beneficial over the long run than a cut in corporate tax rates, would be a temporary stimulus to investment.
