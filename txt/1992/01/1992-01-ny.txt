Developments in the Second District economy since the last report were generally on the soft side. During November retail contacts were split between those with sales above and below plan while December results were generally below target. Residential construction activity remains low and office leasing activity slowed. District unemployment rates rose in December for the third consecutive month following a seesaw pattern during most of the year. Most senior loan officers at small and midsized banks reported no change in their willingness to lend.
Items which sold relatively well included staples such as men's and women's sweaters, gloves, and outerwear as well as dresses, cosmetics and certain toys. Sales of big ticket items varied among respondents. Due in large part to a substantial pickup in sales during the two weeks surrounding Christmas, inventories were reported at or somewhat below targeted levels.
Office leasing activity slowed somewhat since the last report. Midtown Manhattan witnessed its second largest transaction or the year, but a sizable amount of vacant space was marketed and the primary vacancy rate rose. In downtown Manhattan, where no new construction is underway and several well-known buildings are undergoing extensive capital improvement, the vacancy rate declined for the second consecutive month.
On a more positive note, Ford and GM recently announced plans to invest a total of $350 million in their western New York plants over the next two years. Most of the money will be used for new machinery and retooling. In addition, a Dallas-based firm plans to move a manufacturing operation from the South to New York State.
The December survey of Buffalo purchasing managers showed a doubling of the percentage of firms with fewer new orders and a substantial increase in the percentage with lower production. While some of this slowdown apparently is a seasonal pattern, the extent of it is somewhat greater than in December 1990. The November survey of purchasing managers in Rochester, however, showed a decline in the percentage anticipating a deterioration of business conditions over the next quarter.
