Third District business contacts generally foresee some improvement later in the year. Manufacturers expect the pace of orders to pick up over the next six months. On balance, they are planning to add to payrolls and boost capital spending by midyear. Retailers anticipate a somewhat better sales picture, but not before the third quarter. Bankers are also looking to the second half for improvement; they expect a modest upturn in business and consumer lending to get underway then, although some believe residential mortgage activity could post healthy gains this spring with an increase in home sales.
Looking ahead, about three-fourths of manufacturers contacted for this report expect business to improve by midyear, and the rest were about evenly divided between those anticipating steady business and those expecting a decline. Overall, manufacturers look for an increase in orders to boost backlogs and lead to some further reduction in inventories over the next six months. In tine with this forecast, industrial firms in the Third District are planning to extend working hours and increase payrolls slightly. They are also scheduling some increases its capital spending for the first half of the year.
Most retailers expect sales to remain slow at least until midyear. They hope that improving overall economic activity by that time will boost consumer confidence and lead to healthier sales. Nevertheless, many retail contacts do not expect a strong upward trend in consumption spending to develop. Expecting little short-term improvement in demand, and concerned that competitive pressures due to over-capacity will continue, store executives do not anticipate significant increases in revenues. Instead, many indicate they will be looking to improve operating efficiencies in order to bolster profit margins.
On the whole, Third District bankers expect a gradual improvement in the economy and a slow pickup in lending to get underway around midyear. Bank lending officers said the recent decrease in interest rates will make debt service more manageable for business borrowers with floating-rate loans, leading to some improvement in credit quality for both current and potential borrowers; but bank lending officers generally do not expect the lower rates to prompt a significant upturn in demand for commercial and industrial credit. Some bankers said they expect increased homes sales in the spring to boost mortgage demand.
