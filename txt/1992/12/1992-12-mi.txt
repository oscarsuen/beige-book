Most sectors of the Ninth District economy continue to improve slowly in late fall. Retail sales are strengthening. Residential construction is strong. The 1992 crop is in and generally good, with the exception of wet weather retarding the corn harvest. Prospects for winter tourism appear excellent. Labor markets are slightly stronger. A mid-November Minneapolis Fed poll of business and community leaders reflects this improvement. It showed that most considered their local economy to be better than the nation's and many thought that economic activity would be up in 1993. But manufacturing shows little growth, and mining continues to be slow.
The district sales office for a domestic auto manufacturer reported sharply stronger auto sales in November and described its outlook for the balance of 1992 as "extremely good." Three Helena Branch directors report strong auto sales or increased dealer profits in their areas.
The winter tourist season appears to be off to a good start. Deer are abundant in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, northern Wisconsin and northern Minnesota and large numbers of hunters are anticipated. Downhill ski resorts are open in Montana and owners anticipate an excellent season, although spotty snow cover has delayed cross-country skiing in eastern areas of the District.
Other construction is not as strong. A Minnesota director reports that non-residential building is generally limited to the public sector. Road and heavy construction is slowing seasonally as winter sets in. The severe surplus of office space in Minneapolis/St. Paul has cast a pall on large building construction. One director notes that his firm was laying off senior tradespeople who specialize in constructing tall office buildings.
Mining continues to be slow. Iron mines have temporarily furloughed workers due to lack of orders. New oil and gas drilling permits issued in North Dakota through Nov. 1 were below the level for 1991 and substantially below 1990. Though growing, the average drilling rig count for North Dakota in the year to date is below 1991. Production and refining in Montana and North Dakota are generally unchanged from last year.
Soil moisture and pasture conditions going into the winter are rated at adequate or better across most of the region, with the exception of a few districts in the western Dakotas and Montana.
While milk production is generally unchanged from a year ago, dairy profitability is generally satisfactory due to adequate feed supplies and somewhat stronger milk prices.
Most Advisory Council members report somewhat stronger sales of farm machinery. One from eastern North Dakota noted that his report on machinery sales was "the most positive one in three years." Others report that farmers continue to pay down debt and that land sales had picked up slightly in some areas.
