Led by a reported pickup in consumer confidence, economic activity in the First District improved modestly in November. Most manufacturing contacts indicate that demand is even with or slightly above year-ago figures. For 1993, they generally expect a small increase in real GDP. A pickup in November sales has raised spirits in the retail sector; retail contacts now feel that consumer confidence may have rebounded in time for the Christmas season. Commercial real estate remains in the doldrums.
While pricing remains competitive, consumers are not showing the same degree of price-consciousness seen last year. Retailers believe that inventory levels are adequate but not excessive for the holidays, and seasonal hiring has occurred. Permanent staff levels and wages remain largely unchanged.
As demand has increased, margins and profits have begun to improve. However, capital spending plans in most cases remain limited to remodeling existing locations. All contacts express optimism for the 1992 Christmas season.
Manufacturing contacts indicate that foreign sales have been mixed. In some cases they have achieved surprising success by offering an attractive product or technology, despite a generally weak economic climate. Several expressed concern that declining foreign markets will pull down their sales in 1993.
Except for selected items facing strong demand, manufacturers describe both materials and selling prices as flat to down. Just over half of this month's manufacturing contacts indicate that they have reduced U.S. employment--by up to 12 percent--in the past year. At the others, employment levels were unchanged. Most manufacturers report that capital spending has been flat to slightly up over 1991 investment.
Venture capital firms report mixed results for firms in their investment portfolios. According to these contacts, software and semiconductor firms had strong sales, while capital equipment firms had sales below projections. Retailers had trouble meeting their targeted margins, especially in the Northeast, although they experienced improvements over the second quarter; broadcasters were affected by declines in advertising revenue.
