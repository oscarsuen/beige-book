Economic developments in the Second District remained mixed in recent weeks, but seemed slightly more positive, on balance, than in the last report. October sales at most District department stores were reported to be on or above targeted levels though results varied widely. Homebuilders in most of the District noted some recent improvement in the residential construction market, and office leasing activity has been relatively strong in midtown Manhattan. District unemployment rates improved in October but nonfarm employment has continued to decline. Reports from Buffalo purchasing managers showed a worsening in both production and new orders during November following an improvement in October. Loan officers at small and midsized banks indicated no change in their willingness to lend.
Inventories are generally at satisfactory levels and, indeed, a little below plan in some areas where sales were stronger than anticipated. With regard to the holiday season, most contacts anticipate somewhat larger year-to-year gains than occurred last year "but nothing spectacular".
In recent weeks, office leasing activity has been relatively strong in midtown Manhattan where for the first nine months of this year the footage leased was some 23 percent above the year-earlier level. In downtown Manhattan, however, the pace of leasing has been slower and for the first nine months totaled little more than in 1991. As a result, while the primary vacancy rate in midtown Manhattan has been declining, the downtown vacancy rate has risen and by October, according to one source, a two percentage point difference existed between the two rates.
Two other developments which could have a positive impact on the District are noteworthy. Farmers in the West reportedly are now receiving shipments of some of New York City's treated sludge to fertilize crops, restore depleted croplands and curb erosion, which helps lessen the City's sizable waste-disposal problem. In addition, two new, employee-owned airlines have recently begun offering low-cost, unrestricted flights from Newark to various Florida destinations, adding to the growth of this rapidly developing airport.
Reports from Buffalo purchasing managers showed a worsening in both production and new orders during November following a substantial improvement in October. More generally, our District manufacturing contacts indicated continuing weak economic activity.
All respondents reported either maintaining or lowering loan rates. A majority of officers indicated that delinquency rates for mortgages and consumer loans were unchanged or lower during the preceding two months.
