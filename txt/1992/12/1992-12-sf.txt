Outside of medical costs, few upward pressures on prices are reported in District markets. One exception is wholesale electricity prices in the Pacific Northwest, which have risen with demand and a decreasing power surplus.
A telecommunications firm in California reports that orders for new business hookups are weak, and that uncollectible bills remain high. In Hawaii, tourist-related businesses are still in the process of cutting their staffs due to a decline in visitors from the mainland. Tourism in California is reported to have increased slightly in dollar volume over a year ago, but market share is down. The sluggish California economy has led analysts to project a significant state budget shortfall through the end of the 1993-94 fiscal year. Official estimates of the shortfall range from $4.1 billion to $7.5 billion.
Other District manufacturing activity is mixed. Contacts in Utah still report some reduction in defense-related industries, but new hiring by computer software companies. A contact from northern California reports that conditions for small personal computer and defense-related electronic companies continue to soften. Computer software sales by Washington companies are reported strong. Construction machinery sales are reported up 5 percent over a year earlier. A contact in the paint and coatings industry reports that national sales continue at a level slightly more than 5 percent above a year earlier.
Demand for wood products is holding steady, and western lumber production is running slightly above the level of a year earlier. The operating environment for western lumber producers, however, is described as "tough" due to restricted public timber supplies. Contacts report several recent mill closures due to the shortage of logs, with one contact expecting attrition of one-third of existing Northwest lumber and plywood mills. Demand for western newsprint continues to be very strong, however, and several companies are running at capacity.
Stronger conditions are reported in the residential sector. In California, existing home sales climbed sharply during October, and posted the first concurrent monthly and annual sales increases since February. Contacts in eastern Washington report a continued boom in residential real estate and construction, and housing starts in Utah are reported strong.
