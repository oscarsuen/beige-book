South Florida is beginning to experience the expected increase in economic activity as a result of the hurricane rebuilding effort. In particular, contacts report that the local economy of Dade county has recorded substantial increases in both retail sales and construction. However, contacts also report that a number of individuals and families have opted to move out of the area rather than to rebuild their damaged or destroyed homes. On the commercial side, realtors in areas around Dade county have seen a surge in short-term leasing from companies whose facilities were damaged by the storm.
Wages and PricesContacts report that wage pressures are practically nonexistent. Firms continue to focus on cost cutting, including workforce reductions, in order to improve balance sheets. Materials input prices have remained stable for most producers, and competitive market forces have foiled recent attempts to raise prices of final products.
