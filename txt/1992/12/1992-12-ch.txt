Reports provided by individual manufacturers were more optimistic in recent weeks than in October. A manufacturer of parts used in heavy machinery stated that "after the usual lead times following the end of a recession, we are beginning to sea a recovery in capital goods markets." This company also noted that sales of controls for household appliances continue to benefit from the housing recovery. A large appliance manufacturer expected industry-wide domestic shipments to rise modestly again next year. A chemical company reported that sales of coatings used in finishing consumer durable goods are "by far our strongest" area, principally due to strength in sales of housing-related products like cabinetry and furniture. At the same time, this contact noted that sales of coatings used in general industrial purposes remained soft. An office furniture manufacturer stated that sales stopped declining in August, and have experienced a modest but consistent recovery since then. A large manufacturer of fluid power equipment reported that the heavy-duty truck market "is clearly the strongest area of our business." Assemblies have grown slower than orders, mainly because OEMs have been trying to lock in production for later-than-usual delivery next year. However, this contact did not express concern about the prospect of order cancellations, and expects heavy-duty truck assemblies to rise nearly 20 percent in 1993.
