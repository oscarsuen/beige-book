Capital goods production is recovering slowly and unevenly. Industrial controls used in machine tools are strengthening, but orders for the construction and farm machinery industries remain weak, according to some producers. An industrial instrument manufacturer reported an unexpected decline in January and February orders, following a bubble late last year. Orders for heavy-duty trucks soared in February, which sharply boosted the January-February average from the second half of 1991. A small computer producer experienced a surge in sales and profits last quarter, and expects an even better year in 1992. Orders for forgings rose sharply in January from December levels, and shipments were relatively unchanged, which some producers believe will add toproduction and shipments in the months ahead.
Steel output has held up better than some producers had anticipated for this quarter. Steel service centers have been ordering more than expected because of growing optimism about the capital goods outlook, according to a producer. Operating rates of some steel producers are between 80% and 83% of capacity, but steel prices are still declining, and the outlook for profits remains depressed.
