Economic conditions in the District appear to be strengthening somewhat. Retail, housing, and automotive sales have all improved. Agriculture seems on net to be doing reasonably well, and tourism remains strong. Labor market conditions remain weak, while conditions in construction and manufacturing appear mixed.
Auto sales have also revived, apparently bucking the national trend. Dealers are reporting new car sales increases of up to 10 percent and year-to-date sales increases of as much as 11 percent relative to a year ago. New truck sales were reported to be up to 17 percent higher in February and over 20 percent higher for the year-to-date relative to a year ago.
Home sales have recently improved in the District. February sales of single-family homes in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area were up 49 percent relative to a year ago. The median February sales price is not yet available, but in January it was up 4 percent. Fargo-Moorhead had record real estate sales in 1991, with sales of existing single-family homes up 3.4 percent over the previous year.
Tourist activity has been generally good throughout the District. Crossings over the Mackinac Bridge onto the Upper Peninsula rose 9.6 percent in January, setting a record for the month. The total number of bridge crossings in 1991 was 4.9 percent above the previous year's record level. Heavy early snowfall got winter recreation off to a good start, but lack of consistent snowfall has hurt many areas. Late snowfalls in northern and western sections of the Upper Peninsula have greatly improved conditions there. Both Yellowstone and Glacier Parks had record years for tourism. The recent running of the 20th American Birkebeiner cross-country ski race is estimated to have brought $4.5 to $6.5 million in tourist spending to western Wisconsin.
Conditions were mixed in the District's manufacturing industries. In Minnesota there were continuing reports of layoffs. Average weekly hours in the state were at 40.5 in January, down relative to the 41.0 level of the previous month, but above the 40.2 level of a year ago. In South Dakota manufacturing was reported to be doing quite well.
The lumber industry in the District continues to experience difficulties due to environmental issues, and in particular the as-yet-to-be-determined set aside for wilderness areas. Conditions in the District's mining industry appear to be mixed. Exploration expenditures in Montana were $5 million in 1991, down from $35 million in 1990. Copper producers appear to be doing well, however, with smelters running at capacity.
