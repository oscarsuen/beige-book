Conditions varied across major sectors in the Third District in late February and early March; overall, economic activity appeared to be steady or slightly improved. Most manufacturers reported that business has been stable to somewhat better in recent weeks, and new orders were on the rise. Retailers generally indicated that sales were running a few percent above the levels of last February in dollar terms. Many auto dealers said unit sales picked up in January, and although results were mixed for February, customer traffic continued to be good. Most major banks in the Third District reported continuing declines in loan volume outstanding although residential mortgage activity was generally up. Realtors and home builders said sales were rising, especially for moderately priced houses. Commercial and industrial real estate was characterized as soft.
Looking ahead, Third District business contacts express some optimism. Most manufacturers expect orders and shipments to increase over the next six months. Retailers and auto dealers look for gradual improvement. Bankers said they were receiving more inquiries from potential business borrowers although loan applications had not yet picked up. Realtors foresee further increases in residential activity although the recent upturn in mortgage interest rates has caused some concern that recent gains could be short-lived. Demand for commercial office and retail space is not expected to strengthen soon.
Most Third District manufacturers expect business to improve over the next six months. A majority of managers at area plants look for an increase in orders and shipments during the spring and summer, and order backlogs are expected to rise. Expectations of improved business are leading area firms to plan higher capital outlays over the next two quarters.
Third District merchants expressed some optimism for the rest of the year. Although most remain cautious in their planning, some store officials said they were reviewing their sales forecasts and might raise them. However, retailers continue to mention the fragile state of consumer confidence, and several said that a stronger sales trend will not take hold until worries about job security diminish.
Third District auto dealers said that unit sales in January were generally above the average for the month in the past few years. Although reports were mixed for February, most dealers reported that customer traffic had remained fairly healthy. On balance, dealers look for gradual improvement during the year, especially if auto loan rates remain at or below current levels.
Looking ahead, commercial bank lending officers generally expect the demand for residential mortgages to continue moving up, although a few believe the recent backup in mortgage interest rates could slow the current spurt of activity. As for commercial and industrial lending, most of the Third District bankers surveyed said that loan applications were not on the rise, but they were receiving more inquiries from potential business borrowers.
Commercial and industrial real estate values remain under downward pressure, according to Third District brokers. They reported that office leasing activity has been fairly healthy, but property values and rents have been soft as excess capacity remains to be absorbed. While new office buildings have been finding tenants, older buildings have been losing tenants. Demand for retail space and industrial buildings was reported to be weak.
