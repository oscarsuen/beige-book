Most Federal Reserve Districts report some improvement in economic conditions. Business sentiment is described as modestly more optimistic in many parts of the country, though it remains cautious. Representative of many Federal Reserve Districts, Chicago notes "a slow but increasingly widespread advance in the economy since the end of January." Or as St. Louis puts it, "Most sectors ... are reporting growth." Most-often mentioned as improving are residential construction and home sales, auto sales, and other retail sales. There are few indications of significant upward pressures on retail and wholesale prices of goods.
Most-often mentioned as flat or weak are manufacturing and nonresidential construction; bank loan demand is described as little changed. The manufacturing sector remains generally flat, with layoffs and rising unemployment often noted. Yet several districts report glimmerings of recovery in manufacturing, with improving expectations for future activity. Commercial construction remains moribund. Bank loan demand is best described as flat, although residential mortgage lending is often mentioned as a bright spot. Mortgage refinancing activity appears to be tapering off somewhat.
Automobile sales have exhibited widespread (if often modest) improvement. Districts reporting at least some increase in car sales include Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Only Dallas notes declining auto sales. Several districts also mention strength in light truck sales.
Dallas, San Francisco, and St. Louis note continued low oil and gas prices. Minneapolis and Dallas report that as a result of these low prices energy exploration and development expenditures are down.
