While several auto suppliers are anticipating an increase in auto production, improvements in their auto-related activity has not yet appeared. One supplier noted that delivery schedules to auto producers have stabilized in recent weeks, suggesting that auto production plans are firming. A supplier of transmissions stated that sales were down in January, although spot improvements were noted, particularly in 5-speed transmissions. A steel producer reported that first quarter bookings show a seasonally adjusted improvement over the fourth quarter. However, gains were not attributed to autos, but rather to an increase in orders from steel service centers, which generally derive their demand from small industrial customers.
Several auto dealers were upbeat about February auto sales. Traffic has been improving since the end of last year, according to several contacts. One Michigan dealer recorded the best February in the franchises' ten-year history. According to another dealer, "nearly new" program cars are still an important source of dealership sales, but reduced availability of program cars over the next few months should shift the mix of sales toward new cars.
