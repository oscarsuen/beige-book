Companies in some sectors, especially defense-related firms, continue to lay off workers. An ammunition equipment maker released 130 employees at two St. Louis plants. In addition, a plastics molding firm laid off 100 when restructuring plans closed the Louisville plant. A major St. Louis defense contractor laid off an additional 420 workers in January and February: however, the firm also announced that it will hire 500 engineers by year's end because of new contracts.
