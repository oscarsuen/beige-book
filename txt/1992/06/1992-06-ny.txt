Reports on recent developments in the Second District continue to be basically mixed, but marginally more negative in tone than in recent months. On the plus side, office leasing activity in Manhattan continued at a moderate pace and a survey of District manufacturing firms showed business conditions have improved significantly since last November. In contrast, however, District homebuilders noted a recent slackening of activity and department store contacts reported some slowing in sales growth. Labor market developments were also unfavorable, with state unemployment rates rising in May and with layoffs of over 7,000 retail employees expected by summer's end. Senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized District banks indicated no change in their willingness to lend from two months earlier.
Manhattan office leasing activity has continued to rise, but growing inventories of available space have led to increases in overall vacancy rates. In the market for sublet space in Midtown Manhattan, however, declines in asking rental rates have so increased leasing activity that the inventory of available space has finally begun to decline.
Fifteen New York metropolitan area department stores are scheduled to close by summer's end, resulting in the loss of 7,200 jobs. Several of the stores are the last remaining retail anchors in older downtown areas; the Fordham Road section of the Bronx and downtown Newark and New Rochelle are expected to be particularly hard hit. On a more positive note, a major New Jersey shopping mall has announced plans for expansion and renovation, including three new luxury department stores to replace two anchors which had previously closed.
Labor market developments in the Second District have generally been unfavorable. The unemployment rate in New Jersey rose sharply, from 7.8 percent in April to 9.0 percent in May; New Jersey now has the highest unemployment rate of any major industrial state. New York State experienced a much smaller increase, from 7.6 to 7.9 percent. In addition to the expected loss of 7,200 District retail jobs, Bethlehem Steel and MONY announced the elimination of 350 and 267 positions, respectively. In contrast, Prestolite Electric will consolidate its national operations in upstate New York, creating 320 local jobs over the next three years.
Standard and Poor's has placed New Jersey on negative CreditWatch in response to the state's burgeoning FY1993 budget gap. A combination of factors -- including a one percentage point reduction in the sales tax rate, the loss of anticipated federal medicaid reimbursements, and lower than expected receipts -- have led to a prospective budget shortfall in excess of $1 billion for the fiscal year beginning July 1.
A majority of respondents reported no change in delinquency rates for all types of loans during the past two months. Most officers did not indicate a marked increase in problem real estate loans. They did, however, express a preference for restructuring, rather than foreclosing, existing troubled loans.
