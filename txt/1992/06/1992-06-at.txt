Shipments have continued to pickup for a producer of men's wear. New orders have increased steadily for a firm producing sports apparel. One large textile firm producing for institutional customers reported that it was building inventories in anticipation of future increases in demand. However, several textile and apparel manufacturers noted that retailers continue to keep inventory levels low.
Business activity generally remains weak for firms in the energy sector. However, some suppliers of equipment and services to the oil and gas industry believe that this long-troubled market may be stabilizing with the recent firming of natural gas prices. Defense and aerospace industry contacts also reported a slowdown in industry activity as orders have been canceled and delivery times pushed back because of defense cutbacks. These cutbacks spread acquisitions over a longer period of time.
Contacts report that new home inventory levels are relatively low. Consistent with this observation, most builders stated that residential home building activity has continued to improve. Multifamily construction, however, is still weak despise reports that occupancy rates are relatively high in some areas.
Commercial construction activity remains at a minimum. Although some commercial realtors have seen an improvement in leasing activity and a firming in rental rates, contacts in several cities say that markets remain over supplied. Excess office space reportedly has kept rental rates at levels too low to justify new building.
