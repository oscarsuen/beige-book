Reports from Third District business contacts in early June suggested that business conditions were improving slowly. Manufacturing activity continued to move up, on balance, and hiring at Third District industrial plants appeared to be on the increase. Retailers generally reported steady or slightly higher sales for May compared to the prior month and year. Bankers described loan volume as steady, with slight gains in mortgage and auto loans being offset by continuing declines in commercial and industrial lending.
Looking ahead, Third District business contacts forecast slow growth. Manufacturers are relatively optimistic. They predict a continuing increase in activity and they plan to step up hiring and capital spending in the second half of the year. Retailers anticipate improvement in the fourth quarter, but not strong gains. Bankers expect consumer lending to move up slowly but they believe business loan demand will remain soft.
Looking ahead, almost two-thirds of the manufacturers contacted said they expect further gains in the second half of the year while nearly one-third said they anticipate just steady business. Overall, managers at Third District plants foresee increases in orders and shipments during the next six months. The positive outlook is apparently leading manufacturers in the region to step up hiring and capital spending plans; nearly four-out-of-ten said they will add workers and increase outlays for plant and equipment in the second half of the year.
Looking ahead, most Third District retailers expect sales during the summer to be seasonally slow. They are hoping that sales will improve in the fourth quarter of this year, but they do not anticipate a strong upturn because they expect only a very gradual increase in consumer confidence.
Most of the bank lending officers contacted for this report expect   loan demand from businesses to remain soft. They believe firms are   still focusing on cutting costs rather increasing sales to boost   profitability. They also said consumer lending is likely to grow   only slowly, as they foresee slow economic growth and a sluggish   advance in consumer confidence.
