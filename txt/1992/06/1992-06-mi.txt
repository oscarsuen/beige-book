Economic conditions in the District were generally steady. Labor markets continued to show signs of mild improvements. Retail sales continued to exhibit growth relative to last year's level, while home sales showed some signs of retrenchment after a very strong first quarter. Manufacturing was steady to positive in the District, while conditions in the construction sector were mixed with poor conditions in commercial construction offsetting the strong performance of residential construction. Conditions in both the agricultural and mining sectors were mixed.
Price and wage increases are reported to be moderate with the exception of medical costs and, in parts of the District, construction costs.
New car sales were mixed in May and ranged from up 20 percent to down 12 percent relative to a year ago. New truck sales in May ranged from up 1 percent to up 14 percent relative to levels of a year ago. Auctions of "nearly new" fleet cars are reported to be particularly strong in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, attracting many bidders and sometimes aggressive bidding. Dealers are generally optimistic about new car and truck sales for the remainder of the year.
Home sales which were generally quite strong in the first quarter, showed some downward adjustment in parts of the District. After a record-setting first quarter, used home sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area dropped 2.7 percent. However, the housing market is reported to be booming in parts of Montana, due in part to the continuing influx of wealthy out-of-state buyers.
The summer vacation season is only just beginning, but indications are generally positive. Glacier National Park is already reported to be completely booked for the summer. Bridge crossings over the Mackinac Bridge onto the Upper Peninsula set a record for April, up 6.2 percent relative to a year ago. Recent changes in airfares are expected to have some positive impact through the summer months. However, this stimulus to tourism will be less felt in this District than in many others, since a high fraction of our District's tourists travel by auto.
Conditions continued to be steady in the District's manufacturing sector. The April level of average weekly hours in manufacturing in Minnesota of 40.0, while down slightly from the month before, was slightly above its year-ago level. The April level of Minnesota's average hourly earnings in manufacturing was up two-tenths of one percent.
Conditions in the District's mining and lumber industries were mixed. While mining production generally remains steady, some prices have fallen. The price of copper is off by 9 percent since the first of the year. Oil production is generally lower in the District, though the number of active drilling rigs, while small, is up. Concern remains about the availability of timber to District saw mills.
