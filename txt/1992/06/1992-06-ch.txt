Recent surveys supported anecdotal evidence of further strengthening in District manufacturing activity. The composite index for the Chicago purchasing managers' survey climbed higher in May, led by production and new orders. The new orders component has posted marketed improvement in recent months and has risen to levels well above those that prevailed prior to the onset of the recession. The overall index for the Detroit survey was essentially unchanged in May, after climbing to its highest level in the past three years during April. Purchasing managers' surveys in Milwaukee, Southwest Michigan, and Indianapolis have also been posting results consistent with a recovery in recent months. Finally, an April survey of metalworking firms indicated solid gains in production, orders, and employment with above-average results posted in a key activity considered to be a leading indicator for metalworking firms as a whole.
Reports of improving activity front motor vehicle suppliers generally reinforced these observations. For example, one manufacturer reported a pickup in sales as well as production planning, and the firm has reached the point where "we can't do the work we have to do with the labor force we have." A manufacturer of power train components stated that its strongest market now is heavy-duty trucks, where orders have shown a substantial acceleration in the past several months, although efforts to hedge against a price increase anticipated later this year may be playing a role in recent gains. However, this contact also noted that the medium-duty truck market still faces soft demand in some customer classes, notably construction contractors and state and local governments.
