Economic activity continues to improve. The manufacturing sector appears to be strengthening in all districts. The Chicago, Dallas and St. Louis districts report gains in nonmanufacturing sectors as well. All districts except Boston, New York and San Francisco report moderate increases in consumer spending. Residential construction activity remains well above year-ago levels in most districts, and new home prices have risen in several regions. Loan demand appears to be increasing in most districts. Price stability in the retailing and manufacturing sectors seems to be the rule across districts. Adverse weather has affected agricultural prospects in many districts.
Reported inventory levels are mixed. San Francisco district firms report no inventory concerns, while firms in the Kansas City district find their inventories either satisfactory or slightly high. Richmond district firms experienced no changes in inventories or backlogs and foresee no changes in the next six months.
Demand for exports of manufactured goods seems to be waning because of weakening foreign economies. For example, the Boston, Minneapolis, Richmond and San Francisco districts report a drop-off in the volume of durables exports, especially electronics to Japan and appliances to Canada. The San Francisco district, however, reports that exports of electronic components to other Pacific-Rim nations remain strong.
Agriculture, Energy and Natural-Resources-Related IndustriesMany districts report that unseasonably cool weather and inadequate soil moisture have hampered the planting and development of many crops. In the Chicago, Kansas City and St. Louis districts, adverse weather has affected the corn, cotton, soybean and winter wheat crops. Declining livestock prices have recently led cattle and pork producers in the Kansas City district to curtail production. The San Francisco district reports that, except for grains, agricultural exports to Mexico and the Pacific Rim (excluding Japan) have been strong lately. Despite the recent firming of oil and gas prices, the Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts indicate that the energy sector remains weak. Lumber production is up significantly in the St. Louis district, but down in the San Francisco district.
