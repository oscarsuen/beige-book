Ample labor availability kept wage and salary pressures limited throughout the District. Hiring activity picked up in many areas, with contacts in the construction, banking, manufacturing, retail, and services sectors reporting increases. Most new hires were for full-time, permanent positions, although temporary workers remained in demand, particularly in the retail and services sectors. Rising health insurance costs reportedly were the most significant source of increased compensation costs, even though many employers have been passing an increasing share of health costs on to their workers.
Service providers saw solid demand throughout the District. Media and health-care service providers reported further improvements in sales, and one provider of high-tech services noted double-digit sales increases over last year. District travel and tourist activity strengthened further. Hawaii 's tourist traffic rose smartly, due to solid gains in domestic tourism and a sharp increase in visitors from Japan.
