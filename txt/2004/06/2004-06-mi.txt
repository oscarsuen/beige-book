From mid-April through early June the economy in the Ninth District grew steadily. Growth was noted in real estate, construction, manufacturing, agriculture, mining, energy and consumer spending. District employment relative to last year picked up considerably, while wage increases were moderate. Some signs of price acceleration were noted, including significant increases in tuition, and in a number of commodities and manufacturing and construction inputs.
Homebuilding and residential real estate activity were solid. Housing units authorized in District states increased 6 percent for the three-month period ending in April compared with a year ago. The number of signed purchase agreements in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area increased almost 12 percent in April compared with last year. A representative of a realtors association in Minneapolis-St. Paul said that homebuying activity was strong, as well as growth in the number of listings.
A representative of an auto dealers association in Minnesota said that sales in May were strong compared with a year ago. In addition, high gasoline prices were not impeding sales of SUVs. In South Dakota, a representative of an auto dealers association reported strong sales in April compared with a month earlier.
Tourism activity was somewhat slowed during Memorial Day weekend due to cool and rainy weather; however, prospects for summer were optimistic. In northwestern Wisconsin, a chamber of commerce official said that retailers that rely on warm weather have seen declining sales, but restaurant traffic was up. According to a survey conducted by the Minnesota Office of Tourism, only a few business owners expect decreases in activity due to higher gas prices, and others noticed that travelers were tending to stay closer to home. Over 45 percent of respondents expect higher revenue during the summer months; 23 percent expect decreases. A tourism official in Montana said that summer reservations were in line with last year's numbers--which were strong compared with previous years.
In contrast, a desk assembly plant in northwestern Wisconsin recently announced plans to close, resulting in 51 lost jobs. A major disk-drive manufacturer that employs about 3,500 in Minnesota will trim its total workforce by 7 percent.
Wage increases were modest. For example, farm operators in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan paid hired workers 2 percent more per hour in April compared with a year ago.
Some signs of price acceleration were noted. Tuition at the University of Minnesota is slated to increase 14 percent for the coming school year. Gasoline prices in Minnesota at the end of May were up 38 percent compared with a year earlier. A Minnesota meat company recently raised prices about 4 percent to 6 percent on packaged food items. A bank director noted that trucking fuel surcharges were up, and fertilizer prices were at an all time high. Drywall, lumber and cement have all gone up significantly, with many builders particularly concerned about the price of steel. Oriented strandboard prices increased over 200 percent from a year ago.
