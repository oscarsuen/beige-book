The Tenth District economy continued to grow in January and February.  Manufacturing activity expanded further, and retail sales excluding autos were up moderately.  Housing and energy activity generally maintained a brisk pace, and agricultural conditions remained favorable overall.  On the negative side, auto sales fell slightly, and commercial real estate remained weak.  Labor markets also remained slack, although some increases in hiring were noted.  Wage and price increases were generally minimal, but rising costs of materials appeared to be putting some upward pressure on manufacturers' output prices.
