The Tenth District economy continued to grow in January and February.  Manufacturing activity expanded further, and retail sales excluding autos were up moderately.  Housing and energy activity generally maintained a brisk pace, and agricultural conditions remained favorable overall.  On the negative side, auto sales fell slightly, and commercial real estate remained weak.  Labor markets also remained slack, although some increases in hiring were noted.  Wage and price increases were generally minimal, but rising costs of materials appeared to be putting some upward pressure on manufacturers' output prices.
Non-auto retail sales in the district were solid in January and               February, as most stores reported moderate increases from a year               ago. Among product categories, sales were particularly strong for               most kinds of apparel and home improvement items. With the recent               solid sales, most store managers were satisfied with inventory levels               and planned typical increases in stocks heading into spring. Most               managers remain optimistic that solid year-over-year sales growth               will continue in coming months, and some stores plan modest increases               in hiring. In contrast to non-auto retail sales, sales of motor               vehicles weakened somewhat in January and February and were below               year-ago levels in much of the district. With the weaker-than-expected               overall sales, inventories at most dealerships were higher than               desired. On the positive side, some dealers reported a pick-up in               used vehicle sales, and nearly all dealers expect total vehicle               sales to improve in coming months. Tourism activity in the district               was generally strong. Rocky Mountain ski areas reported increased               out-of-state visits in February, and activity was especially brisk               over the President's Day weekend. Airport traffic also increased               further in most cities. Heading forward, travel agents generally               report solid bookings for spring leisure travel.
District manufacturing activity expanded further in January and               February, although rising input costs were putting increased pressure               on many firms' profit margins. Plants generally reported higher               levels of capacity utilization than in previous surveys, and shipments               remained well above year-ago levels. Factory employment and hours               were also reported to be slightly higher than in previous surveys.               Firms remained quite optimistic about future production, due in               part to persistent order backlogs and low levels of finished goods               inventories. In a change from past surveys, contacts in the aircraft               manufacturing sector were also cautiously optimistic. Most manufacturing               materials remained generally available, and managers expect few               changes in lead times heading forward. Many plant managers, however,               expressed considerable concern about the effects of recent sharp               increases in the price of steel and some energy-based products.
Residential real estate activity continued at high levels in January               and February, while commercial real estate markets remained weak.               Although single-family housing starts edged down in most district               cities, starts generally remained near last year's strong levels.               Moreover, most builders expect home construction to strengthen somewhat               through the spring, over and above the normal seasonal increase.               Realtors reported that home sales were flat to slightly higher in               most district cities following modest declines in late 2003. Home               prices were basically unchanged from previous surveys. Realtors               generally expect continued improvement in home sales and moderate               increases in home prices in coming months. Mortgage lenders reported               a modest rise in mortgage demand, as demand for both new home purchase               loans and refinancings increased slightly. Lenders expect mortgage               demand to continue to edge higher through the spring. Commercial               real estate activity in the district remained weak in January and               February. Office vacancy rates and prices for office space were               largely unchanged in most district cities. On the positive side,               however, sales of office space were up slightly in some cities,               and commercial realtors generally expect modest improvements in               office markets in 2004.
Bankers report that loans and deposits both held steady since the               last survey, leaving loan-deposit ratios unchanged. Demand for home               mortgage loans stabilized after falling in the last two surveys,               and demand for other loan categories was also little changed. On               the deposit side, slight increases in liquid accounts and small               time deposits were offset by a decline in large CDs. All respondent               banks left their prime lending rates and consumer lending rates               unchanged. A few rural banks tightened lending standards, citing               concerns about local business activity.
District energy activity maintained a brisk pace in January and               February. The count of active oil and gas drilling rigs in the region               was unchanged from the previous survey and still 30 percent above               year-ago levels. Some producers reported that a shortage of qualified               rig crews was constraining expansion of drilling. Most energy contacts               expect slow but sustained growth in drilling activity in coming               months, as energy prices are expected to remain high.
District agricultural conditions generally remained solid in January               and February, although the drought continued to have some adverse               effects. District bankers reported minimal financial impact on producers               from the mad cow incident last December, and credit reviews generally               showed improvement in farm loan portfolios during the past year               due to strong cattle and grain prices. Farmland values also remained               high in most parts of the district. On the negative side, the winter               wheat crop remained dry. Also, while ample hay supplies kept forage               plentiful, lingering drought conditions caused most cattle producers               to continue to delay expansion of their herds.
Wage and price increases generally remained modest in January and               February, but there were more signs of upward price pressures in               manufacturing. As in the previous survey, hiring announcements by               district firms exceeded layoff announcements. Nevertheless, reports               of labor shortages remained relatively scarce outside of the health               care, energy, and trucking industries, and most firms continued               to offer only cost-of-living wage increases. Most retailers reported               flat prices compared with previous surveys and expect little change               in their prices heading forward. Builders reported rising costs               for some materials, including lumber, sheetrock, and steel products,               and they expect continued increases through the spring. In the manufacturing               sector, firms noted sharp cost increases for steel and some energy-based               products. To cover these cost increases, a sizable number of firms               either increased selling prices or plan to do so in coming months.               A couple of firms said they would have to raise output prices just               to stay in business. A few other firms, however, reported they were               able to increase productivity enough to offset the higher costs.
