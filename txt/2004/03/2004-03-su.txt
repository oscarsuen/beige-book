Economic activity continued to expand in January and February,               according to information received by Federal Reserve District Banks.               Growth was variously described as moderate in Boston, Philadelphia,               Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, firm in               Minneapolis, sound in San Francisco, and showing signs of accelerating               in New York, Richmond, and Dallas.
Consumer spending rose in most Districts. There were gains in sales               of general merchandise in January and February in all Districts               except St. Louis, which reported a slight decline. In contrast to               the general improvement in merchandise sales, motor vehicle sales               slowed in most Districts. Tourism activity increased compared to               last winter. Service sector activity has been expanding. Manufacturing               output continued to rise in all Districts except Cleveland, where               it has been steady. Real estate market conditions showed little               change: commercial markets generally remain soft and demand for               housing continues to be strong. Agricultural conditions were mixed:               demand for beef appears to be recovering from the effects of mad               cow disease but exports of poultry products have been curtailed               by the outbreak of avian influenza. Oil and gas production remain               at high levels and iron ore processing has increased. Bank lending               has been growing moderately.
Employment has been growing slowly in most Federal Reserve Districts.               Wages and salaries have increased slightly, but employers report               substantial increases for employee health-care costs. Most Reserve               Banks reported level or modestly increasing retail prices, but information               received from manufacturers and other businesses indicates that               commodity prices have moved up more noticeably. The largest increases               have been for steel and for lumber and other building materials.               Shipping charges have also risen recently.
Nearly all Districts reported that auto sales slowed during January               and February and compared to a year ago. The exceptions were Boston,               where sales picked up in February after falling in January, and               Philadelphia, where sales were about steady. Auto dealers in several               Districts attributed the falloff in sales to cold or stormy weather               that kept shoppers off the lots. With the slowdown in sales, dealers'               inventories increased.
Tourism activity has improved. Bountiful snowfalls in mountain               areas gave a boost to ski resorts, according to Richmond, Chicago,               Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Richmond and Atlanta               reported good business at beach resorts, and in New York and San               Francisco hotel occupancy increased compared to last year.
Transportation activity has increased in most parts of the country.               National freight companies based in Richmond indicated their business               has improved and trucking companies have seen increased activity               in Cleveland and Atlanta. Trucking was said to have slowed seasonally               in Dallas, but railroads in the Dallas District noted robust activity.               Trucking companies reported increased costs for fuel and they said               labor costs have increased as a result of recent regulations limiting               drivers' hours. Nonetheless, Chicago and Cleveland indicated that               sales of heavy trucks have increased.
Residential real estate markets continued to be strong in the               majority of Districts. Although cold temperatures and winter storms               interrupted home building in some areas in January, housing demand               generally remained high. Recent gains in home sales and building               activity were noted in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas,               and San Francisco. In Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas               City residential real estate activity continued at high levels.               In Richmond the housing market was said to have slowed recently,               but builders expect activity to pick up. Overall, builders and real               estate agents in most Districts expect home sales in 2004 to be               close to the 2003 sales record. Home price appreciation was characterized               as steady in most Districts with the exception of San Francisco               where the rate of increase was said to have slowed somewhat recently.
Changes in deposits have been mixed. Banks in the Atlanta District               have generally had steady growth, but growth has slowed in Cleveland               and Dallas where bankers think investors are moving money out of               bank deposits and into debt and equity market instruments. Banks               in the Kansas City District indicated that their deposit levels               have been steady.
Reports on wages indicated that increases continue to be moderate.               However, the rate of increase in benefit costs continues to exceed               that of wages. Medical insurance and workers' compensation insurance               fees remain on the rise in most Districts, although the rate of               increase does not appear to be accelerating.
