Economic activity continued to expand in January and February,               according to information received by Federal Reserve District Banks.               Growth was variously described as moderate in Boston, Philadelphia,               Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, firm in               Minneapolis, sound in San Francisco, and showing signs of accelerating               in New York, Richmond, and Dallas.
Consumer spending rose in most Districts. There were gains in sales               of general merchandise in January and February in all Districts               except St. Louis, which reported a slight decline. In contrast to               the general improvement in merchandise sales, motor vehicle sales               slowed in most Districts. Tourism activity increased compared to               last winter. Service sector activity has been expanding. Manufacturing               output continued to rise in all Districts except Cleveland, where               it has been steady. Real estate market conditions showed little               change: commercial markets generally remain soft and demand for               housing continues to be strong. Agricultural conditions were mixed:               demand for beef appears to be recovering from the effects of mad               cow disease but exports of poultry products have been curtailed               by the outbreak of avian influenza. Oil and gas production remain               at high levels and iron ore processing has increased. Bank lending               has been growing moderately.
Employment has been growing slowly in most Federal Reserve Districts.               Wages and salaries have increased slightly, but employers report               substantial increases for employee health-care costs. Most Reserve               Banks reported level or modestly increasing retail prices, but information               received from manufacturers and other businesses indicates that               commodity prices have moved up more noticeably. The largest increases               have been for steel and for lumber and other building materials.               Shipping charges have also risen recently.
Retail sales of general merchandise rose in most Federal Reserve               Districts in January and February. Strong or strengthening sales               were reported in New York, Richmond, and Dallas. Sales growth was               moderate in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City,               and San Francisco. Retailers in Cleveland said sales met or exceeded               their expectations. Retail sales in Atlanta moderated slightly in               February but remained above the level set in February last year.               St. Louis retailers said sales declined slightly relative to a year               ago. Spring apparel was said to be selling well in New York, Philadelphia,               Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Sales               of electronics, appliances, and home furnishings were relatively               strong in Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City.               Jewelry was selling well in Atlanta and St. Louis. Reports on retailers'               inventories across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts indicated that               store stocks were mostly in line with sales. Stores were still receiving               spring merchandise, but retailers were generally maintaining conservative               inventory plans.
Nearly all Districts reported that auto sales slowed during January               and February and compared to a year ago. The exceptions were Boston,               where sales picked up in February after falling in January, and               Philadelphia, where sales were about steady. Auto dealers in several               Districts attributed the falloff in sales to cold or stormy weather               that kept shoppers off the lots. With the slowdown in sales, dealers'               inventories increased.
Tourism activity has improved. Bountiful snowfalls in mountain               areas gave a boost to ski resorts, according to Richmond, Chicago,               Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Richmond and Atlanta               reported good business at beach resorts, and in New York and San               Francisco hotel occupancy increased compared to last year.
Service industry activity moved up in the Districts reporting on               this sector. Boston and St. Louis noted increased demand for information               technology services. St. Louis also indicated that demand for insurance               and health-care services increased, but financial services and transportation               activity eased. In the Dallas District, accounting and consulting               firms were seeing increased activity compared with the final quarter               of last year. In San Francisco, demand has strengthened for media,               high-technology, and health-care services. In Richmond service sector               business was steady to somewhat improved.
Transportation activity has increased in most parts of the country.               National freight companies based in Richmond indicated their business               has improved and trucking companies have seen increased activity               in Cleveland and Atlanta. Trucking was said to have slowed seasonally               in Dallas, but railroads in the Dallas District noted robust activity.               Trucking companies reported increased costs for fuel and they said               labor costs have increased as a result of recent regulations limiting               drivers' hours. Nonetheless, Chicago and Cleveland indicated that               sales of heavy trucks have increased.
Manufacturing activity rose during January and February in 11 of               the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. The exception was Cleveland, where               factory production rates were said to be steady. There were notable               increases for electronic and electrical equipment in Philadelphia,               St. Louis, and Dallas, and semiconductors in Boston and San Francisco.               Cleveland and Chicago indicated that steel production had increased,               and Philadelphia and St. Louis indicated that output of metal products               had risen. Production of heavy trucks increased in Chicago, and               auto and auto parts production increased in Cleveland and St. Louis,               although the increase was said to be seasonal. Atlanta and Dallas               noted increased output of lumber, and Richmond and St. Louis reported               gains in furniture production. Other manufacturing industries in               which expanding activity was noted were biopharmaceuticals (Boston),               machine tools (Chicago), aerospace (St. Louis), and chemicals (Cleveland               and Chicago). In a few industries reports were mixed. Food processors               posted gains in Dallas but declines in St. Louis. Richmond District               textile producers were gaining business but there were textile plant               closings in the Atlanta District.
Commercial real estate market conditions have shown little change               in most Districts. Continuing high vacancy rates, slowing leasing               activity, and downward pressures on rents were reported by Boston,               Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City. Conditions in               major commercial real estate markets were mixed in the St. Louis               and Minneapolis Districts. Despite the generally slack and unchanged               market situation in most parts of the country, a few Districts noted               some signs of improvement. In New York and San Francisco vacancies               have moved down slightly and rents have begun to recover. Leasing               activity has picked up in the Washington, DC area of the Richmond               District.
Residential real estate markets continued to be strong in the               majority of Districts. Although cold temperatures and winter storms               interrupted home building in some areas in January, housing demand               generally remained high. Recent gains in home sales and building               activity were noted in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas,               and San Francisco. In Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas               City residential real estate activity continued at high levels.               In Richmond the housing market was said to have slowed recently,               but builders expect activity to pick up. Overall, builders and real               estate agents in most Districts expect home sales in 2004 to be               close to the 2003 sales record. Home price appreciation was characterized               as steady in most Districts with the exception of San Francisco               where the rate of increase was said to have slowed somewhat recently.
Agricultural conditions have been mixed. Good citrus crops were               reported in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts, although there was               some concern in Atlanta that world supplies might exceed demand               at current prices. Beef prices were still declining in Chicago and               St. Louis while San Francisco reported that they have firmed and               Dallas noted that prices and demand had not been affected as much               as expected. Chicago reported increased prices for corn, soybeans,               and milk. Dry weather in the Kansas City District has adversely               affected winter wheat and led some cattle producers to postpone               expanding their herds, and ice and snow in the Richmond District               has limited grazing there. The outbreak of avian influenza has curtailed               exports of poultry from the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis               Districts.
Federal Reserve Districts reporting on the energy sector noted generally               strong, steady conditions in January and February. Drilling activity               has been fairly level in recent months in the Kansas City and Dallas               Districts, but Minneapolis noted a slight decrease in exploration               activity. San Francisco indicated that natural gas producers were               operating close to full capacity. Rising worldwide demand for steel               has stimulated increased iron ore production. Minneapolis reported               that iron ore producers in that District were operating at full               capacity and ore prices were rising.
In most Federal Reserve Districts lending by commercial banks grew               moderately in January and February. Lending to business firms was               rising in Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco. In               Chicago, lending to small businesses was on the rise while overall               business lending was described as flat. Commercial bankers in Richmond               and Atlanta said demand for business loans has been restrained as               firms are reluctant to increase capital spending. Demand for personal               loans, including credit cards, appeared to have eased in New York               and Philadelphia, remained steady in Dallas, and increased in Chicago.               Mortgage lending declined in Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco,               and increased slightly in Richmond and Chicago.
Changes in deposits have been mixed. Banks in the Atlanta District               have generally had steady growth, but growth has slowed in Cleveland               and Dallas where bankers think investors are moving money out of               bank deposits and into debt and equity market instruments. Banks               in the Kansas City District indicated that their deposit levels               have been steady.
Federal Reserve Districts reporting on employment generally noted               modest increases in January and February. Boston indicated that               temporary help agencies were placing more workers in manufacturing,               software development, and government. There has been increased demand               for temporary help workers in customer service and sales positions               in the Richmond District, in office and health-care jobs in the               Dallas District, and for a variety of jobs in the Chicago District.               Employment agencies in New York indicated that they have been experiencing               gradual increases in demand, and professional employment agencies               in the Washington, DC area of the Richmond District have boosted               their own staffs in response to increased business from their clients.               San Francisco District employers in the retail, construction, and               agricultural sectors have been increasing their hiring moderately.
Reports on wages indicated that increases continue to be moderate.               However, the rate of increase in benefit costs continues to exceed               that of wages. Medical insurance and workers' compensation insurance               fees remain on the rise in most Districts, although the rate of               increase does not appear to be accelerating.
Most Reserve Banks reported fairly stable or slowly rising retail               prices in January and February, but accelerating increases in some               industrial commodity prices. Steel prices have increased, and prices               of iron ore and scrap metals have risen as well. Prices of lumber               and other materials used in home building were on the rise in most               Districts. Energy prices, especially natural gas, remained high               in most Districts and Atlanta noted price increases for petrochemicals.               Cleveland noted rising rates for shipping by truck and Chicago reported               rising costs for overseas shipping, primarily due to increased costs               for ocean transport.
