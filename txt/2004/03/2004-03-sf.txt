Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicate that the economy               continued to expand soundly in January and early February. Consumer               and producer prices generally were stable, although respondents               noted increases in some energy and material costs. Respondents indicated               that hiring activity in recent weeks was mixed, with moderate expansion               of payrolls in retail, construction, agriculture, and high-tech               manufacturing, and little new hiring in banking and the rest of               manufacturing. Wage and salary increases remained restrained, with               total compensation continuing to rise more noticeably. Sales of               retail merchandise showed modest growth. Manufacturing activity               in the District continued to improve, driven in part by an increase               in demand for information technology upgrades by firms. Business               conditions for cattle ranchers in the District recovered to some               extent in recent weeks as fears surrounding mad cow disease apparently               abated; other District agricultural and natural resource businesses               faced stable conditions. Respondents noted solid house price appreciation               and a brisk pace of new home construction in most District markets.               Commercial real estate markets stabilized further. Reports from               District banking contacts indicated that demand from businesses               for commercial and industrial loans improved slightly from the previous               survey period.
Wage and salary pressures in the District remained modest in recent               weeks. The costs of medical and workers' compensation insurance               premiums rose further, however, particularly in California. According               to respondents, increases in non-wage labor costs generally constrained               hiring of full-time employees throughout the District, while hiring               of temporary workers strengthened further. Indeed, the division               of healthcare premium costs between employers and employees is a               central issue in the labor strikes among grocery workers in Southern               California and construction workers in Hawaii.
Respondents indicated that hiring activity since the last survey               period was mixed. Contacts in banking and manufacturing, with the               exception of high-tech manufacturing, generally reported little               new hiring, while those in retail, construction, and agriculture               noted moderate increases in payrolls. Looking ahead, most contacts               expect little change in hiring activity in the near future, with               the exception of contacts in high-tech manufacturing and retail,               who expect the rate of hiring to pick up from its pace in recent               weeks. Those contacts expecting an increase in hiring generally               attributed it to improving business conditions. Those contacts expecting               no change or a slowing of hiring, though, generally pointed to productivity               gains stemming from the use of IT and other technologies which allow               businesses to meet product demand without substantial increases               in staffing.
Business conditions in the services sector continued to improve               in the District. Demand strengthened for media and high-tech services.               The increased demand for high-tech services was reportedly due in               large part to replacement and upgrading of information technology               equipment by firms. Demand for preventative and outpatient healthcare               services edged up further. Conditions in the District travel and               tourism sector remained strong. Favorable snow conditions aided               winter tourism activity in several areas of the District. Hotel               occupancy rates improved and allowed many hotels to raise rates.
