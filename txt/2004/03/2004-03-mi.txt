From early January through late February the overall Ninth District economy showed firm growth. Residential real estate, manufacturing, consumer spending, mining and tourism were up, while commercial real estate, energy and agriculture were mixed. District employment grew slightly. Wage and price increases were generally modest; however, significant price increases were noted in steel, health insurance and home heating.
Housing permit activity was strong, but sales slowed. A representative               of a contractors association in Montana reported that residential               building remains healthy, especially high-end homes in resort areas.               Permits for new housing construction in the Minneapolis-St. Paul               area were up 15 percent in January compared with a year ago, but               recent construction slowed due to cold and snowy weather. The number               of closed home sales was down 20 percent in January in the Minneapolis-St.               Paul area, with the median price 5 percent greater than in January               2003.
Traffic and sales were noticeably down at Minnesota auto dealerships               in January and early February compared with last year, according               to a representative of a car dealers association.
Substantial snowfall in late January and early February boosted               winter tourism activity in many parts of the district. A Minnesota               ski hill reported near capacity ski crowds in early February. Mountain               snow packs through January were 30 percent to 40 percent deeper               than last year in Montana; one large resort reported skier numbers               up 10 percent. However, a tourism official in the Upper Peninsula,               which often reaps the benefit of being one of the few areas with               snow, reported that recent activity was slower than last year because               most Midwest areas have snow.
According to a recent survey of Minnesota businesses across industry sectors conducted by DEED, 82 percent of respondents expect employment to remain the same for the first half of 2004, while 13 percent expect to hire new workers. An informal survey of businesses in southwestern Minnesota during early February showed that two-thirds of respondents expect flat employment while the remaining third expect modest increases in staff levels. Employment reductions include over 120 employees recently laid off at a bus assembly plant in North Dakota. A Minnesota-based retailer will eliminate 70 positions at its headquarters and distribution centers.
Increases in wages were moderate. Recent wage increases have generally stayed within 2 percent to 3 percent, according to a bank director. Labor representatives in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area noted that health care benefits are the top issue in collective bargaining talks.
While overall price increases were modest, significant increases were reported in steel, health insurance and home heating. According to preliminary results of the survey of district manufacturers, 31 percent of respondents expect to increase prices, and 10 percent expect to decrease prices. A steep hike in some steel prices was noted, including a 30 percent climb in steel wire and tubing. A bank director noted that health insurance rate increases remained in the double digits. Prices for heating homes in the Upper Peninsula were reported as high as 50 percent above year-ago levels.
