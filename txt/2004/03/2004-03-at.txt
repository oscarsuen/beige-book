Reports from Sixth District contacts suggested that business activity continued to expand through mid-February.   Merchants' sales, with the exception of auto dealers, met or exceeded expectations and the near term outlook was upbeat.   Residential housing markets remained generally strong, and commercial real estate markets began to pickup slightly from low levels.   Factory activity was increasing in the District, and transportation contacts reported improving business.   The District's tourism sector continued to outperform last year, aided in part by the weaker dollar.   Banking industry contacts noted a steady flow of deposits, but subdued business investment activity.   Reports indicated that hiring had picked up in some fields, including manufacturing, but many firms continued to rely extensively on flexible staffing options.   Price increases were generally restrained except for certain commodities such as lumber, fuel, and steel.
There was some evidence that commercial real estate markets in               the region have stabilized. Vacancy rates have declined from recent               peaks in many markets; net absorption has been positive; and there               are continued reports of small improvements in leasing activity.               While still at low levels, development activity has reportedly picked               up slightly as well, particularly the construction of institutional               facilities.
Although most contacts indicated that competitive pressures continued               to restrain prices, a few reports noted price increases for lumber,               steel, fuel, and raw materials used in steel and petrochemical production.               New regulations limiting truck drivers' hours were said to have               caused freight costs to increase.
