Eleventh District economic activity showed signs of accelerating from early January to mid-February. Contacts expressed increased optimism about the economic outlook but had mixed views about the strength of expected activity in the second half of 2004. Manufacturing activity continued to strengthen, and retail sales were up. There was little change in service sector, energy, construction, financial services, real estate activity and agriculture.
Heating oil prices, near 90 cents in late December, were pushed               over $1 per gallon by cold January weather and high crude prices.               However, high inventories of distillates and warmer weather have               put downward pressure on prices in recent weeks. Gasoline demand               has been strong, and gasoline prices have been rising as heating               oil retreats, with wholesale prices over $1 per gallon. At the pump,               (nominal) prices have been the highest ever seen in January and               early February.
Natural gas prices rose sharply with winter weather in early January,               and spot prices peaked at the Henry Hub around $7.00 per million               Btu. Inventories so far this year generally have remained above               the five-year average, with cold weather not pulling them below               normal for this time of year. Milder weather in late January and               February pushed prices back to near $5.
A number of industries reported upward price pressures--as a result               of stronger demand, input cost increases and a weaker dollar. Prices               of food products have started to rise, according to contacts, as               a result of higher input costs; flour and shortening costs are up               15 percent over the past month. High fuel prices remain a concern               for transportation firms. Strong rail demand pushed up prices, but               intense competition between airlines is keeping a lid on fares.
Prices have risen for some construction-related products. Producers               of cement are very excited because this is the first price increase               in 2 to 3 years. Heavy demand and low inventories pushed up lumber               and timber prices. Prices for some final products, such as doors               and cabinets, have remained steady but are expected to increase               in 2005. Paper manufacturers say their customers are increasing               inventory in response to an announced 10 percent price increase               planned for early March. Paper manufacturers say customers expect               to be able to pass roughly 50 percent of this price increase on               to consumers. High petroleum prices have increased the price of               resin and box liners.
Inventories are low for fabricated metals, with shortages of scrap               steel becoming more pervasive. Producers of fabricated metals report               that input commodity prices have risen sharply. Primary metal producers               also report concerns about shortages of inputs, including copper               and scrap steel. Producers of primary metals report that soaring               input prices are pushing up selling prices, although one contact               said profits are up as well. High tech firms report that inventories               are at desired levels and, while overall prices were sluggish, there               were some increases in semiconductors prices.
Many contacts expressed continued concerns about high insurance               costs but say the rate of increase has subsided. Some industries               also reported concern about the increased cost of state unemployment               insurance and municipal real estate taxes.
High-tech manufacturing conditions continue to strengthen. Manufacturers               of electronics and communications devices said that shipments have               picked up and strength in orders suggests continued strong activity               in the second quarter. Demand was reported to be coming from a broader               area of the world with some pickups occurring in Europe and Latin               America and continued strength in North America and Asia.
Petrochemical activity was up, including increases in demand, capacity               utilization, and margins for ethylene, polyethylene, propylene,               chlorine and PVC. Stronger U.S. industrial activity helped boost               demand, but sales were also stimulated by major outages in Europe               and Venezuela. Activity is expected to weaken some as these outages               are restored and as a new ethylene plant starts up on the U.S. Gulf               Coast. Strong demand for heating oil and gasoline boosted refining               activity and profits. Imports of refined products were at the top               of their five-year average.
Demand for temporary staffing services is improving slowly. There               continues to be strong demand for workers to supply the health care               industry, and demand for workers to supply most other sectors has               bottomed out. A lot of call center work and some IT (programming)               jobs are being sent overseas, though there continues to be rising               demand to provide call centers in some regions.
Trucking firms reported a seasonal drop in demand but expect activity               to pick up seasonally. Demand for rail shipments was robust and               surpassed shipping activity levels both year-to-date and during               the last four weeks across all categories except for motor vehicles.               Demand was particularly strong for shipments of grain and to support               ocean freight. The airline industry remains very competitive. Some               airlines report improved demand while others report that demand               remains soft.
Apartment markets continued to weaken, with Dallas/Fort Worth               and Houston posting the lowest occupancy rates in a decade. Rents               are still falling, and concessions remain prevalent. Single-family               construction continues to rise at a good pace. Competition has kept               a lid on home prices despite increases in some building materials.
