Economic activity in the Eighth District continues to expand slowly.  Reports of stronger orders, plant openings, and expansions in the manufacturing and services sectors have all increased since our previous report.  Retail sales declined slightly in December and January over year-earlier levels.  Car sales also decreased slightly over the same period.  Residential real estate markets are still doing well, but commercial real estate markets remain weak in most of the District.  Overall lending activity at a sample of District banks experienced little change over the past three months.
Car dealers in the District reported that, compared with last year,               sales in December and January were slightly down, on average. About               half of the car dealers surveyed reported increases in sales, while               the other half reported decreases. More than 40 percent of the car               dealers surveyed noted that sales of used and low-end cars had increased.               About 25 percent of the contacts reported increased use of rebates,               while 68 percent reported no change. About 25 percent of contacts               surveyed reported a decrease in the acceptance rates of finance               applications, while 17 percent reported an increase in acceptance               rates. More than 35 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported               that their inventories were at desired levels, while 50 percent               noted that their inventories were too high. A slight majority of               the car dealers surveyed are optimistic about the next two months               and expect sales to increase over 2003 levels.
The District's services sector also continues to show signs of               improvement. Firms reporting facility openings, expansions, and               new hires include those in the banking, insurance, health care,               technology, tourism, and airline services sectors. While firms in               the services sector seemed generally optimistic, some firms reported               facility closings, employee transfers, and layoffs. Firms reporting               facility closings and layoffs include those in the financial and               transportation services sectors. Reports from the telemarketing               sector were mixed.
