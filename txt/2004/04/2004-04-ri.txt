The Fifth District economy continued to expand at a moderate pace               in March and early April, as stronger growth in manufacturing activity               was tempered by slower growth in the services sector. Manufacturers               posted strong gains in shipments and new orders in March, suggesting               an end to the prolonged downturn in the sector. In contrast, services               businesses and retailers reported a slowdown in demand and only               a limited expansion of payrolls. In commercial real estate, office               and industrial leasing was flat in most areas, although a pickup               in retail leasing occurred in the Washington, D.C. area. Home prices               rose and sales remained exceptionally strong in Maryland and Virginia,               but weakened somewhat in the Carolinas. In the financial sector,               residential mortgage lending was boosted by a dip in mortgage interest               rates in February and March and contacts noted more interest in               business borrowing to finance capital spending. District labor markets               exhibited modest job gains in the manufacturing and services sectors.               Some upward price pressures were in evidence as retailers and manufacturers               reported that they were attempting to pass through some higher costs               of raw materials. In agriculture, planting and crop development               was hampered in some areas by colder than normal weather and dry               soil conditions.
Fifth District commercial realtorsreported little change in leasing activity during recent weeks. Realtors in the  Washington, D.C., metropolitan area remained very busy, while contacts in Raleigh, N.C., and Baltimore, Md., characterized leasing activity as "status quo."By sector, office and industrial leasing was generally flat, but retail leasingwas particularly strong, especially in the Washington, D.C., market. Anotherbright spot was Greenville, S.C., where contacts were "very encouraged"by increased activity in all market categories during the last ninety days.Office and retail rents firmed up in the Washington, D.C., metro area andrealtors in all markets reported that landlord concessions were slowing.
