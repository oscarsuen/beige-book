From late February through mid-April, the overall               Ninth District economy demonstrated solid growth. Residential real               estate, manufacturing, agriculture, consumer spending, mining, energy               and tourism were up, while commercial real estate activity was slow.               District employment grew slightly. Wage increases and overall price               increases for consumer goods were modest; however, significant increases               were noted in a number of manufacturing and construction inputs               and commodities.
In contrast to commercial construction, residential               real estate activity generally grew. Home sales activity was brisk               in February and March in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, according               to a representative of a realtors association. Home closings increased               almost 2 percent in Billings, Mont., during February compared with               a year ago. Housing units authorized in district states; however,               were down 4 percent for the three-month period ended in February               compared with a year ago. In addition, recent apartment vacancy               rates in Sioux Falls, S.D., reached 10 percent.
Auto sales were up in February after a very slow               January, while sales in March were strong, according to a Minnesota               auto dealer.
Winter tourism finished the year sturdily in many               parts of the district. Snowmobiling and cross country skiing activity               was well above year-ago levels and ran late into the season in northwestern               Wisconsin, according to a chamber of commerce official. Convention               bookings in Duluth, Minn., were recently reported up by 25 percent               in 2004. However, winter use of Yellowstone National Park was down               18 percent, primarily due to issues regarding snowmobile regulations.               Tourism officials and resort owners are optimistic for a healthy               summer season in northern Minnesota.
In contrast, in Minnesota an energy company recently               announced plans to reduce staff by 100 employees at its headquarters,               and a retirement services company will layoff 100 employees due               to consolidation. Recent announcements of closings and lay-offs               in Eau Claire, Wis., will likely result in about 600 job losses.
Overall wage increases were modest, while health benefits               remained a key issue in contract disputes. During March and early               April, over 2,000 bus workers were on strike in the Minneapolis-St.               Paul area, primarily over retiree health benefits. Meanwhile, employment               officials noted upward pressure on wages in Bozeman, Mont., due               to the low unemployment rate (2.9 percent).
Overall price increases for consumer goods were modest,               while significant increases were noted in a number of manufacturing               and construction inputs and commodities. Helena bank directors noted               that recent price increases were generally moderate. The Billings,               Mont., area consumer price index increased 0.3 percent in February               from January. Meanwhile, news reports and bank directors noted significant               price increases in several manufacturing and building materials,               including steel, copper, aluminum and lumber. Gasoline prices in               Minnesota for the week of March 29 were up 13 percent from a year               ago. Prices received by North Dakota farmers for agricultural products               were up 10 percent in March compared with the same month last year.
