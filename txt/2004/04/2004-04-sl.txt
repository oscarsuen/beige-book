Business activity in the Eighth District               continued to expand slowly since our previous report. Still, some               contacts in the manufacturing sector announced plant closings and               downsizing. Retail sales increased slightly in January and February               over year-earlier levels. Car sales were flat-to-down over the same               period. Home sales slowed in some areas of the District, but commercial               real estate markets appear to have stabilized. Total loans at a               sample of small and mid-sized District banks increased between early               January and mid-March, a slight improvement over the past few months.
The EighthDistrict's manufacturing sector continues to show signs of improvement.Contacts in the aerospace, automotive, and biopharmaceutical industries reportplant openings, expansions, and new jobs. Despite expansion in some areas,there have also been announcements of plant closings and downsizing in theDistrict. Affected industries include textiles, electronic equipment,commercial building appliance, and music publishing. Contacts throughout theDistrict are concerned about rising steel prices. While some contacts areattempting to re-negotiate prices with existing clients, many are reluctant topass price increases onto customers. In the services sector, firms in thehealth, transportation, and financial industries report improvements inbusiness activity and plans for expansion. Contacts also report that the priceof transportation services has increased, in part due to increasing fuel pricesand in part due to recent legislation limiting the amount of time a driver can beon the road without resting.
General retailsales in the District improved slightly in January and February compared withthe same months last year. Many retailers cited early tax refunds as onereason for improved sales. Strong-selling products included clothing, discountitems, hardware, seasonal gift items, and new and used farm equipment. Autodealers report flat or decreased sales, despite zero percent financing andincentives. Auto dealers report that inventory levels are much higher than desired.Contacts are hopeful that sales will improve throughout the rest of the year.
Home sales have slowed down in some areas of the Eighth District.February year-to-date sales have fallen in the greater St. Louis and Louisville areas compared with February 2003. St. Louis had a decrease of 2.6 percent and  Louisville of 10.0 percent. Memphis year-to-date sales were 8.5 percenthigher in February than a year earlier, and contacts expect this trend tocontinue throughout the spring. Residential construction is still doing wellin most of the District, with February year-to-date permits for single-familyhomes up in all of the District's metropolitan areas. Construction has beenvery active in northeastern Arkansas, and contacts are optimistic about thefirst half of 2004. February year-to-date permit levels increased by 4.6percent in the greater St. Louis area. One exception is western Tennessee, where residential construction has yet to improve.
Contacts in theDistrict indicate that the commercial real estate market appears to havebottomed out. The industrial and office markets have remained soft in Louisville, where fourth-quarter vacancy rates were slightly higher than 2002 year-endrates. The fourth-quarter industrial vacancy rate in Memphis increased to 23.9percent, about 1 percentage point higher than the previous quarter. Commercialconstruction has started to pick up in most of the District. Both private andgovernment construction have remained steady in southern Indiana. Constructionhas increased during February in western Tennessee, particularly in the Jackson area. There are several projects underway in central and south-central Kentucky, such as the construction of new elementary and middle schools in Jamestown, Kentucky.
Corn planting is well under way in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee,               but it is only in the beginning stages in the other states. A small               portion of the soybean, sorghum, and rice crops has already been               planted as well. Farmers expect to plant 1 percent fewer acres of               corn and 10 percent fewer acres of sorghum this year than in 2003.               In contrast, they anticipate planting 2 percent more acres of soybeans               than last year and at least the same number of acres of cotton,               tobacco, and rice as in 2003. This year's total winter wheat acreage               increased by 7 percent and is rated at 65 percent or more in good               or excellent condition in every District state. The latest ratings               for soil moisture and pasture conditions are good throughout the               District, except in Mississippi. Livestock remains mostly in good               condition, and prices received for beef cattle in mid-March are               showing signs of a rebound after recent declines.
