Reports from business contacts indicate that the Twelfth District's               already firm economic expansion acquired some additional momentum               in March and early April. Price inflation for final goods and services               has remained low overall, although increases in the prices of energy               and key industrial commodities raised costs in some industries.               Some District firms have increased their hiring pace for permanent               employees or indicated plans to do so in the near future. District               retailers and service providers saw generally solid demand. Manufacturing               activity picked up for a variety of products. Both domestic and               foreign demand for District agricultural and resource-related products               reportedly was solid. Activity in residential real estate markets               remained vibrant, while the glut in commercial real estate markets               eased a bit. Most banks reported solid loan demand.
Upwardwage and salary pressures in the District were quite modest during the surveyperiod. However, the rising cost of health benefits increased labor costssomewhat, and employers have responded in part by shifting some of the burdento workers. In labor markets more generally, respondents noted a modest pickupin hiring by District businesses, especially in the construction, education,health-care, and retail sectors. Hiring was focused largely on permanentrather than temporary workers, and some firms not currently hiring reportedlyplan to do so in the near future. By contrast, some state and localgovernments cut staff due to budget constraints.
District serviceproviders saw further strengthening in demand. Sales increased for mediaservices and high-tech services in some areas, and reports indicated thatactivity at District seaports had stepped up to handle increased merchandisetrade flows. Demand for preventive and outpatient health-care services edgedup further, although rising out-of-pocket payments for patients reportedly haveled to reduced use of hospital services in some areas. District travel andtourist activity generally was solid, with notable strength reported for Hawaii, Utah, Arizona, and Southern California. A Southern California respondent alsonoted substantial sales gains in the restaurant industry there. The weakdollar relative to the yen reportedly helped boost Japanese visitor counts toselected District destinations. Although hotel occupancy rates rose in manyareas, room prices generally remained somewhat low compared to prior years,reportedly due in part to rising reliance on bargain deals available throughthe Internet.
