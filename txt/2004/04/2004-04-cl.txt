Business conditions continued to improve in the Fourth District,               and the pace of improvement appears to have accelerated in recent               weeks. More manufacturers reported expanded production in the last               several weeks than earlier in the year, and most expect growth to               continue in the months ahead. Steel producers continued to see strong               demand. Retailers reported improved sales this spring. In the construction               industry, residential builders continued to report strong sales,               and conditions for commercial contractors appear to have improved               in some areas of the District. District banks reported rising commercial               loan demand and falling delinquency rates. Finally, shipping firms               reported that activity continues to expand, at year-over-year rates               on the order of 10 percent.
Despite these signs of improvement in the economicenvironment, the hiring plans of most firms remain modest. Reports of risinginput prices that began earlier in the year became more widespread in recentweeks, and firms indicated that they have been more successful at passing theseinput-cost increases along to their end consumers.
Manufacturers' inventories remained at acceptable levels inrecent weeks according to most contacts. However, some steel buying is said tobe to supplement low levels of inventoried steel, as concerns about theavailability of steel supplies intensify and production lead-times remain long.Manufacturers reported limited additions to their payrolls in the last severalweeks. Nearly all manufacturers who sought new hires reported being able tofind workers without difficulty and at no significant increase in wages. Anyconcerns about labor costs related mainly to rising health care and otherbenefits costs.
Rising materials costs, however, were a common theme frommany manufacturing contacts, though these reports were more widespread amongdurable-goods producers. Prices reportedly rose in recent weeks for petroleum-basedproducts and items such as steel and aluminum. Prices for both flat-rolled andstructural steel have continued to rise in recent weeks. And as shortagespersist, prices for scrap steel are still about twice what they were a yearago, though some reports suggested that these prices may have peaked in March.Several firms indicated that they had successfully raised their prices tocompensate for these input-cost increases and indicated their intention tocontinue raising prices in order to offset additional increases in input costs.
Some retailers noted that merchandise is being marked downless and promotions are being offered less often, while firms are said to bespending more on advertising. Contacts continued to characterize inventoriesas mostly flat on a year-over-year basis. There were no reports of significantwage changes; however, contacts continued to report rising health care costs.
The pace of automobile sales has risen slightly since thebeginning of the year. Contacts attributed the improvement in part to the poorweather that persisted earlier this year. Nevertheless, sales in March weresaid to be similar to those from this time a year ago. Inventory levelsreportedly remain high. Used car sales are said to be steady.
Forcommercial builders, conditions appear to be improving in some areas of theDistrict. Reports suggested that sales may be reviving in the Cleveland and Pittsburgh markets after a period of prolonged weakness. District-wide,however, conditions remain rather weak. Some contacts expect theeconomic environment to improve in the months ahead, reporting renewed customerinterest. Of concern, however, are rising materialscosts, particularly for steel-related products. Commercial builders have beenless successful than homebuilders at passing input-cost increases along totheir customers.
