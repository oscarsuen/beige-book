Eleventh District economic activity continued to accelerate from               mid-February to mid-April. Retail sales growth was surprisingly               strong, according to contacts, but there has been little change               in demand for business services. Manufacturing respondents report               that they are experiencing stronger sales that are partly the result               of growing demand and partly the result of previous reductions in               industry capacity. Construction and real estate activity is showing               scattered signs of picking up. Residential activity remains quite               strong but is softening. Contacts expressed concern that there will               need to be a pickup in relocations or job growth for residential               activity to remain strong and for nonresidential activity to strengthen.               Agricultural conditions are favorable. In general, contacts are               optimistic about the outlook for activity, but remain cautious,               noting concerns that the upcoming presidential election will likely               result in a lot of negative press about the economy that could dampen               activity.
Producers of cement, glass, tile andbrick reported improved ability to pass cost increases forward to theircustomers. Lumber and paper producers also reported higher input and sellingprices, and paper producers expect further gains in selling prices in the thirdquarter. Fabricated metals producers say heavy demand from China has drawn down their suppliers' inventories and led to shortages of several inputs,such as galvanized metal and steel. The removal of steel tariffs has not donemuch to alleviate price increases, they say, because supply lines that weredirected away from the U.S. when the tariffs were in place have yet to beredirected back, leaving the industry dependent on domestic suppliers of steel.
Strong U.S. demand for gasolinelowered inventories and pushed up retail prices to record highs (in nominaldollars). Oil prices have been boosted by strong global demand (especially in Asia), threats of terror attacks, a lower dollar, low inventories, and the announcement ofOPEC production cuts. Crude inventories have risen five of the last six weeks,and are now just above the lower range of five-year averages. Heating oilprices declined seasonally throughout the period from 94 to 84 cents pergallon.
Natural gas prices remainhigh despite inventories that are only slightly below normal for this time ofyear, pushed up by rising oil prices and expectations that future sources ofnatural gas will be more expensive. Petrochemical price increases are beingseen in a long list of base chemicals and plastics, including ethylene,propylene, polypropylene, styrene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, and PET bottleplastic. Capacity shortages are reported for ethylene, chlorine, styrene, butstyrene pricing may fall back some as the turnaround season ends, and ethylenewill soon face increased supply from a new facility that is just starting up.
Restaurant prices are up 1 to 2percent. Legal fees are up 5 to 10 percent. Railroads continue to operate at ornear capacity. Strengthening demand has enabled firms to raise prices and passhigher fuel costs on to customers. Trucking firms plan to increase prices topass higher fuel costs on to clients.
Retailers say they are beginning tohave some pricing authority. Input prices are higher for many products, largelybecause of the weaker dollar. Still contacts say they find ways to redesignproducts to lower the cost of production. Contacts also said that, in responseto the antidumping concerns with Chinese products, they have been able to findfurniture production in other countries at a similar quality and productioncost. Retail inventories are in good shape, but retailers commented that theyhave remained conservative in their purchases for the rest of the year,preferring to be surprised by stronger demand that will allow pricing powerrather than being left with excess inventory.
Some high-tech manufacturers reportedsignificant price pressures, and bookings four months out suggest some moderateprice increases. Telecommunication equipment prices remain low due mostly to anincreasingly competitive market. Selling prices are also lower for apparelproducers, and they see no signs of upward pressure in the future.
Airline passengers remain pricesensitive and firms continue to offer discounts to stimulate demand. Industrycapacity is outstripping GDP growth, and surging fuel prices are keeping profitmargins slim. Carriers are having difficulty in pushing fuel surchargesthrough. Competition for new homes has put a lid on price increases despitehigher steel and lumber costs.
High-tech manufacturers report thatgrowth in orders has increased slightly since the last survey. One contact saidthat growth is coming from increased demand for existing products and that,with the exception of high-definition TV and wireless communication, mostmanufacturers have not increased their research and development into newproducts. Telecommunications manufacturers have seen slow improvement in thelast few months. Telecommunications service providers have seen a slightimprovement in business spending, which is usually a promising signal of animproving market.
Demand for petrochemicals has beenstrong and the industry continues to improve, with only a few areas having aserious overcapacity problem, such as polystyrene. The overcapacity has beencured in some areas like chlorine and ethylene by a slump that lasted longenough to permanently close some plants. Competition from imports has beenlimited by a weak dollar and heavy demand from China. Strong demand forgasoline has boosted profit margins for refineries. Capacity utilization hasbeen a little low, in part because of seasonal maintenance that is now ending.Inventories of gasoline are at a five-year low for this time of year.
Transportation activity is mixed.Rail demand is strong across a range of categories and shipments are upsignificantly over last year. Contacts plan to hire additional employees andincrease the size of their locomotive fleet. Demand for air travel is also upover the past month. Trucking activity is still soft, but contacts areoptimistic that demand will improve.
Apartment leasing picked up in Dallasand Houston over the past six weeks, according to respondents. Concessions arestill rampant, particularly in Dallas, and effective rents continued to decline,but at a slower pace. Contacts are concerned about the amount of apartmentconstruction and fear it may slow the sector's recovery.
Texas' largest office markets weremostly unchanged over the past six weeks. The amount of space available edgedup slightly in Dallas, and rents fell, although the rate of decline has slowedcompared with last year. Despite the large amount of space available, Dallas remains a hotbed of investor activity, according to respondents. Houston's weakdowntown market is still dealing with repercussions related to the fallout inenergy trading. Contacts say a recent announcement to relocate 2,000 employeesinto downtown is a promising sign.
