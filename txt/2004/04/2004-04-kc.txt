The Tenth District economy expanded solidly               in March and early April. Retail sales increased, manufacturing               activity continued to grow, and labor markets showed further improvement.               In addition, housing and energy activity rose from already high               levels. Agricultural conditions were little changed from the previous               survey, while commercial real estate markets were still generally               weak. Wage and retail price increases remained modest, but more               manufacturers than in past surveys were raising their output prices.
