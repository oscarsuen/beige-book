Optimism continued to grow among commercial real estate contacts as modest   improvements in leasing activity were noted and the amount of sublease space   declined. Construction remained at low levels but reports of plans for new development   increased. The majority of commercial construction underway was in the retail   sector.
Several reports cited instances of rising prices for building materials and   food products, and that these were mostly being passed on to final users. Contacts   noted that some food prices had increased notably over the past few months.   High prices for lumber, metals, and cement remained a challenge to builders,   although strong demand has made it easier to pass on these higher costs in new   building projects.
