From early June through mid-July the economy in the Ninth District grew modestly. Growth was noted in residential real estate, construction, manufacturing, mining, energy and consumer spending. Conditions were mixed in commercial real estate, tourism and agriculture. District employment relative to last year picked up considerably, while wage increases were moderate. Significant price increases were noted for building materials, food products and freight.
However, in Minneapolis-St. Paul, activity was more stagnant. The vacancy rate   for industrial space remained significant, as industrial absorption was slow.   Representatives from a large real estate firm noted that inquiries increased,   but manufacturers await another positive quarter to purchase more space. The   office market remained mostly unchanged with plenty of unused space, but the   practice of offering more concessions to prospective tenants has leveled.
Residential real estate activity grew. Housing units authorized in district   states grew 5 percent for the three-month period ending in May compared with   a year ago. About 20 percent more home sales closed in June compared with a   year ago in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. However, one realtor noted that sales   among lower-priced homes were slower. A bank director described the housing   market in Billings, Mont., as tight, with prices and buying activity up.
Tourism was mixed, but the outlook is strong. Tourism was down substantially   in June due to cool, wet weather in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, according   to a tourism official; however, hotels reported that bookings recently picked   up for the remainder of the season. June tourism activity was about the same   as a year ago in South Dakota, with strong bookings noted for July and August   in the Black Hills. Recent tourism activity and advanced reservations were strong   in Montana, according to a tourism official.
Increased crude oil prices drove up the input costs for many agricultural producers.   The USDA forecasts that wheat, corn and milk prices will soften somewhat from   the recent strong levels, and prices for livestock, hogs and broilers will increase   slightly.
In contrast, a call center in North Dakota will close at least temporarily   in August, resulting in about 260 layoffs. A computer company in South Dakota   laid off 300 employees after closing a plant in June. Restructuring at the U.S.   Forest Service could result in 15 layoffs at one Montana office, according to   the supervisor.
Wage increases remained moderate. Nurses at a hospital in the Upper Peninsula   recently signed a contract that includes an annual 4 percent wage increase,   but also agreed to pay more for health insurance. A Minnesota bank director   noted that recent increases in wages and benefits for building trade unions   have ranged from 3 percent to 6 percent.
Significant price increases were noted   for building materials, food products and freight. Steel prices were up at least   25 percent and seem to increase every three to four months, according to a bank   director. A major food product producer and distributor based in Minneapolis   recently announced plans to raise prices on several food products, including   soups, frozen breakfast food and yogurt. Merchants in northern Montana reported   higher freight costs, as much as 30 percent. Gasoline prices in Minnesota were   down 29 cents in the beginning of July compared with prices in May, but were   27 cents higher than a year ago.
