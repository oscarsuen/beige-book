Economic activity in the Third District was rising moderately in July. Manufacturers
reported increases in orders and shipments compared with June. Retailers indicated
that sales of general merchandise were strengthening in early July after a slight
dip in June. Auto and light truck sales slowed in June and were about steady
in early July. Banks reported that overall lending continued on an upward trend,
with increases in most credit categories. Service sector firms have seen increased
demand and employment agencies reported stepped-up hiring.
The outlook in the Third District business community is generally positive.
Manufacturers expect increases in shipments and orders during the next six months.
Retailers expect a good pickup in sales for the back-to-school shopping period.
However, auto dealers forecast a fairly steady sales rate in the second half
of the year, somewhat below the pace of the first half. Bankers expect moderate
growth in lending to continue in the months ahead. Service sector companies
are optimistic that business will continue to expand.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity in the Third District continued on an upward trend in
July, and the number of firms reporting gains increased slightly compared with
June. About half of the companies surveyed in July posted higher shipments and
orders than in the previous month, and around one in ten reported decreases.
Overall, there were increases in order backlogs and delivery times at area plants.
Increases in new orders were especially strong for firms producing industrial
materials and equipment, building materials, and a variety of paper products.
Order backlogs have risen markedly among makers of petroleum, metal, and lumber
products.
Around half of the manufacturing firms polled in July indicated that the prices
of the goods they purchase rose during the month, although some noted that prices
for steel and lumber appeared to be leveling off. Many firms continued to express
concern about continuing high prices for natural gas. Around one-third of the
firms surveyed for this report implemented price increases in the past month
for the products they make. About one-third of the firms indicated that they
have raised wages recently; most of these reported that the increases were between
2 and 4 percent.
The region's manufacturers expect further expansion in business activity. Half
of the firms surveyed in July expect increases in shipments and orders, and
less than one in five expects decreases during the next six months. Area manufacturing
firms are scheduling increases in capital spending and are planning to add employees
in the next six months.
Retail
Third District retailers generally reported a slowing in sales from May to June
but some strengthening in early July. Most of the store executives contacted
for this report attributed the slower sales in June to unseasonably mild weather,
which restrained sales of fans, air conditioners, warm weather apparel, and
other seasonal merchandise. Merchants also said store traffic was off as outdoor
activities took precedence over shopping for many consumers.
Retailers said the slackening in sales in June left some stores with higher
than planned inventories, and these stores were implementing price discounting
to move summer merchandise. However, most stores have been keeping inventories
relatively light, so extensive discounting is not anticipated. Several stores
have already begun back-to-school promotions, and most retailers expect a healthy
pickup in sales as the back-to-school shopping period gets under way.
Auto dealers reported a slowing in sales in June compared with May, and roughly
steady sales in early July. Inventories have increased well above desired levels
at many dealers. On balance, dealers in the region expect total vehicle sales
to be steady during the rest of the year, but at a lower level than during the
first half of the year. They anticipate declining demand for light trucks to
be offset somewhat by higher demand for cars.
Finance
Outstanding loan volume at Third District banks rose slightly in June, according
to banks contacted for this report, and the trend has continued in July. Commercial
and industrial loans were growing moderately, with much of the gain coming from
rising credit needs of service companies and continuing growth in lending to
residential construction firms. Residential mortgage lending has also continued
on an upward trend. Consumer credit was rising, with moderate increases in credit
card lending and somewhat stronger growth in other types of personal loans.
Contacts at the region's banks and financial services companies continue to
remark that strong competition among bank and nonbank lenders is limiting increases
in loan interest rates.
Bankers in the District generally expect overall lending to rise during the
rest of the year. They anticipate further moderate gains in business and personal
lending. Many expect lending for residential construction and sales to peak
soon, but they note that activity in this sector has yet to show signs of easing.
Services
Most of the Third District service firms contacted for this report indicated
some recent improvement in business conditions. There has been increased activity
in accounting and engineering services and some strengthening in demand for
information technology services. General business services activity has also
picked up somewhat. Trucking firms reported growing demand for their services
throughout the region. Most service sector contacts express cautious optimism
that business conditions will continue to improve.
Temporary and permanent employment agencies in the region reported increasing
demand for workers. Firms in a broad range of industries are seeking sales and
marketing professionals, and there has been growing demand for information technology
workers, especially programmers. While staffing companies indicated that firms
are stepping up employee searches and hiring, they noted that most companies
are adding workers only as their business picks up and staffing needs become
pressing.
