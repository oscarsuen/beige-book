Economic activity in the Third District was rising moderately in July. Manufacturers   reported increases in orders and shipments compared with June. Retailers indicated   that sales of general merchandise were strengthening in early July after a slight   dip in June. Auto and light truck sales slowed in June and were about steady   in early July. Banks reported that overall lending continued on an upward trend,   with increases in most credit categories. Service sector firms have seen increased   demand and employment agencies reported stepped-up hiring.
The outlook in the Third District business community is generally positive.   Manufacturers expect increases in shipments and orders during the next six months.   Retailers expect a good pickup in sales for the back-to-school shopping period.   However, auto dealers forecast a fairly steady sales rate in the second half   of the year, somewhat below the pace of the first half. Bankers expect moderate   growth in lending to continue in the months ahead. Service sector companies   are optimistic that business will continue to expand.
Around half of the manufacturing firms polled in July indicated that the prices   of the goods they purchase rose during the month, although some noted that prices   for steel and lumber appeared to be leveling off. Many firms continued to express   concern about continuing high prices for natural gas. Around one-third of the   firms surveyed for this report implemented price increases in the past month   for the products they make. About one-third of the firms indicated that they   have raised wages recently; most of these reported that the increases were between   2 and 4 percent.
The region's manufacturers expect further expansion in business activity. Half   of the firms surveyed in July expect increases in shipments and orders, and   less than one in five expects decreases during the next six months. Area manufacturing   firms are scheduling increases in capital spending and are planning to add employees   in the next six months.
Retailers said the slackening in sales in June left some stores with higher   than planned inventories, and these stores were implementing price discounting   to move summer merchandise. However, most stores have been keeping inventories   relatively light, so extensive discounting is not anticipated. Several stores   have already begun back-to-school promotions, and most retailers expect a healthy   pickup in sales as the back-to-school shopping period gets under way.
Auto dealers reported a slowing in sales in June compared with May, and roughly   steady sales in early July. Inventories have increased well above desired levels   at many dealers. On balance, dealers in the region expect total vehicle sales   to be steady during the rest of the year, but at a lower level than during the   first half of the year. They anticipate declining demand for light trucks to   be offset somewhat by higher demand for cars.
Bankers in the District generally expect overall lending to rise during the   rest of the year. They anticipate further moderate gains in business and personal   lending. Many expect lending for residential construction and sales to peak   soon, but they note that activity in this sector has yet to show signs of easing.
Temporary and permanent employment agencies in the region reported increasing   demand for workers. Firms in a broad range of industries are seeking sales and   marketing professionals, and there has been growing demand for information technology   workers, especially programmers. While staffing companies indicated that firms   are stepping up employee searches and hiring, they noted that most companies   are adding workers only as their business picks up and staffing needs become   pressing.
