Wage and salary pressures were modest overall. However, shortages of qualified   job applicants and increased outside competition for existing employees generated   notable wage and salary increases for skilled occupations in a number of industries,   including construction, manufacturing, financial services, and technology services.   Contacts noted that where wages have been rising, productivity gains generally   have been adequate to hold constant or reduce labor costs per unit of output.   There were a few exceptions, notably for some firms in the banking, health-care,   and construction industries, where productivity growth did not keep pace with   wage gains and rising labor costs were absorbed into profit margins or passed   on to final prices. Some contacts noted recent or anticipated slowing in the   pace of productivity gains in their industries. Respondents in all sectors reported   that rising health insurance costs made a significant contribution to increases   in overall compensation costs.
Service providers saw strong demand throughout the District. Robust sales were   reported for providers of advertising, communications, entertainment, and health-care   services. Shipping traffic through District ports expanded, spurred by vigorous   international trade flows. District travel and tourism activity strengthened   further. Hawaii's tourist traffic has been growing at a double-digit pace compared   with a year earlier, and hotel occupancy rates there recently regained their   highs from the year 2000. Hotel occupancy rates also rose in San Francisco.
