Following significant increases in activity in recent months, the pace of economic   activity appeared to slow in the Fourth District through the eight weeks ending   June. The pace of production increases slowed for most District manufacturers,   though production typically remained above year-ago levels. In the retail sector,   several firms reported that sales gains slowed in the late spring. Residential   builders reported that sales continued to slow as well, especially in the lower-price   part of the market, while business conditions for commercial builders remained   weak. By contrast, District banks continued to report rising commercial loan   demand. Trucking and shipping firms continued to see strong activity.
Input price pressures remained a persistent feature of the economic environment,   with a wide array of metals, energy, and food prices rising in recent weeks.   Few firms reported any significant hiring plans for the remainder of 2004.
The increases in production that were typical throughout the District in the   early part of 2004 appeared to taper off in the eight weeks ending June. Nevertheless,   production for most manufacturers remained above year-ago levels. These trends   were largely the same for both nondurable and durable goods producers. Among   durable goods producers, domestic steel manufacturers continued to report strong   shipment volumes at a time when they would typically expect demand to decline   due to seasonal patterns. In fact, many mills continued to limit the amount   of steel they provide to their contract customers. District auto plants appeared   to see an increase in production levels in the late spring, but these levels   remain below those of a year ago.
Manufacturers typically reported that they were running their plants at or   above normal utilization levels. While capacity utilization rates remained particularly   strong among steel producers, some noted that they continued to be constrained   by shortages of some raw materials. Several durable goods manufacturers reported   that their inventories had risen above acceptable levels. Nondurable goods manufacturers,   by contrast, continued to report that their inventories were at acceptable levels.   Regarding hiring, most firms reported that they had not added additional staff   recently, and several durable goods firms foresaw staff reductions in the months   ahead. Wage rates reportedly remained stable in recent weeks.
In general, input costs continued to increase for manufacturers in May and   June. Prices for various metals, including aluminum and steel, rose further   recently; these prices reportedly remained significantly above their levels   of a year ago. And several food processing firms reported that prices for some   foods increased sharply in recent weeks, including milk, chicken, and beef.   Finally, prices for petroleum-based products also continued to rise. Several   producers reported that they could partially pass these input cost increases   through to their customers.
Several District retailers reported that sales gains slowed in the late spring.   This follows the robust increases in spending that occurred earlier in 2004.   Many contacts attributed the recent sluggishness in sales to unseasonably cool   temperatures throughout the District in the eight weeks ending June. Some also   noted that fewer markdowns might have held consumers back. On a year-over-year   basis, discount stores saw sales gains, while sales at department stores were   typically weaker. Several contacts also indicated that the Midwest has tended   to see slower sales growth recently than other parts of the country.
Retailers reported holding less inventory than at this time last year. While   wage rates remained steady, increases in input costs were more widely reported   than in the recent past. Increases in food prices were especially pronounced   recently, affecting restaurateurs and grocers. Nevertheless, the prices of many   other categories of goods continued to fall, for example, electronics and apparel.
In general, new car sales were sluggish throughout most of the District in   May and June, though sales in northeastern Ohio were reportedly robust during   this period. In addition, several dealers reported that sales of larger vehicles   remained strong despite high gasoline prices.
Reports from residential builders pointed to a further slowing in sales in the   last several weeks. The decline in demand seemed particularly evident in the   lower-price part of the market, which builders view as being more sensitive   to increases in interest rates. Indeed, many builders attributed the recent   slowing in sales to rising mortgage rates and are altering their financing products   accordingly in an attempt to make them more attractive. In contrast to previous   reports, many homebuilders now expect that sales in 2004 will not surpass those   seen in 2003. While input costs are still said to be higher than in the winter   and at this time last year, they have reportedly remained steady in the last   several weeks.
After some signs of improvement in previous months, business conditions for   commercial builders reportedly remained weak through the eight weeks ending   June. One exception was school construction, which continued to be a bright   spot in an otherwise weak environment. It is reported that input costs continued   to rise for commercial builders, especially for items such as steel, lumber,   concrete, and petroleum products. Only a few contacts reported that they could   fully pass input cost increases on to their end consumers.
Loan demand from commercial clients reportedly remained strong in the eight   weeks ending June and has also increased from this time a year ago. District   banks have reported stronger commercial borrowing consistently since the beginning   of this year. By contrast, consumer loan demand was mixed in May and June. Some   institutions continued to report strong residential real estate lending, though   the rate of refinancing activity has continued to slow. Delinquency rates reportedly   remained largely unchanged in recent weeks, and applicant credit quality was   characterized as stable or slightly improving. Contacts reported that their   core deposits had grown both in recent weeks and relative to this time a year   ago. With respect to hiring, some institutions indicated some difficulty finding   qualified entry-level employees, despite an abundance of applicants.
Contacts from the trucking and shipping industry continued to report robust   conditions in May and June, with shipment volumes rising in recent weeks and   advancing ahead of those from this time a year ago. As has been the case for   some time, demand came from an array of industries. It was reported that requests   to ship steel were especially strong, and foreign shipments of steel were said   to be the strongest in approximately three years. All trucking companies reported   running their fleets near capacity. Several noted that they plan to purchase   trucks to expand their fleets soon, though truck orders can take up to six months   to fill. Input costs continued to be high, with fuel prices fluctuating in recent   weeks but reportedly staying stable on average. Finally, firms reported that   drivers were demanding higher wages recently.
