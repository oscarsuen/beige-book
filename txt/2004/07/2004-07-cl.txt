Following significant increases in activity in recent months, the pace of economic   activity appeared to slow in the Fourth District through the eight weeks ending   June. The pace of production increases slowed for most District manufacturers,   though production typically remained above year-ago levels. In the retail sector,   several firms reported that sales gains slowed in the late spring. Residential   builders reported that sales continued to slow as well, especially in the lower-price   part of the market, while business conditions for commercial builders remained   weak. By contrast, District banks continued to report rising commercial loan   demand. Trucking and shipping firms continued to see strong activity.
Input price pressures remained a persistent feature of the economic environment,   with a wide array of metals, energy, and food prices rising in recent weeks.   Few firms reported any significant hiring plans for the remainder of 2004.
Manufacturers typically reported that they were running their plants at or   above normal utilization levels. While capacity utilization rates remained particularly   strong among steel producers, some noted that they continued to be constrained   by shortages of some raw materials. Several durable goods manufacturers reported   that their inventories had risen above acceptable levels. Nondurable goods manufacturers,   by contrast, continued to report that their inventories were at acceptable levels.   Regarding hiring, most firms reported that they had not added additional staff   recently, and several durable goods firms foresaw staff reductions in the months   ahead. Wage rates reportedly remained stable in recent weeks.
In general, input costs continued to increase for manufacturers in May and   June. Prices for various metals, including aluminum and steel, rose further   recently; these prices reportedly remained significantly above their levels   of a year ago. And several food processing firms reported that prices for some   foods increased sharply in recent weeks, including milk, chicken, and beef.   Finally, prices for petroleum-based products also continued to rise. Several   producers reported that they could partially pass these input cost increases   through to their customers.
Retailers reported holding less inventory than at this time last year. While   wage rates remained steady, increases in input costs were more widely reported   than in the recent past. Increases in food prices were especially pronounced   recently, affecting restaurateurs and grocers. Nevertheless, the prices of many   other categories of goods continued to fall, for example, electronics and apparel.
In general, new car sales were sluggish throughout most of the District in   May and June, though sales in northeastern Ohio were reportedly robust during   this period. In addition, several dealers reported that sales of larger vehicles   remained strong despite high gasoline prices.
After some signs of improvement in previous months, business conditions for   commercial builders reportedly remained weak through the eight weeks ending   June. One exception was school construction, which continued to be a bright   spot in an otherwise weak environment. It is reported that input costs continued   to rise for commercial builders, especially for items such as steel, lumber,   concrete, and petroleum products. Only a few contacts reported that they could   fully pass input cost increases on to their end consumers.
