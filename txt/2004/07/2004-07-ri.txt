Fifth District realtors reported that commercial leasing activity slowed considerably   during recent weeks, partly because of the normal seasonal lull. "It's the annual   summer routine, everyone is on vacation, it's hard to schedule meetings, and   the deals just don't get done," noted one realtor in Washington, D.C. Despite   the seasonal slowdown in most of the District, a contact in Columbia, S.C.,   reported that the local market had strengthened during the last month as "office   space is hot and retail space is on fire." Rents across all sectors were generally   flat since our last report and new construction activity remained spotty.
