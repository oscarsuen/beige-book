Reports from business contacts in the First District are somewhat more mixed   in early July than they were six weeks earlier. Some contacted retailers and   manufacturers are less upbeat this time around, although most respondent firms   continue to make gains. Many contacts mention rising prices for selected commodities,   with some indicating it is becoming easier to pass these cost increases--at   least partially--along to customers via slightly higher prices. Residential   real estate continues to be a positive factor in the New England economy.
First District retailers cite mixed sales results in the second quarter. According   to contacts, home improvement and building product sales continue to increase   by double digits, while furniture sales are mostly flat compared to this period   last year. Consumer spending on small-ticket items, such as art supplies and   apparel, is stronger than spending on big-ticket items, such as electronic equipment   and flooring. A state auto dealers' association reports weak sales across the   board in the second quarter; manufacturers' incentives continue to be popular   but are not spurring sales as much as they did earlier.
Inventory levels are up slightly according to most respondents. A number of   contacts report cost increases for wood, steel, fabric, and paper goods, which   have resulted in slight increases in selling prices. Some respondents indicate   that customers are willing to absorb these increases, particularly for paper   goods. Employment levels are mostly steady, with some slight increases, although   one contact is considering cutbacks. Capital spending is generally in line with   plans, some of which call for minimal spending.
Most contacted retailers anticipate that sales will improve slowly in the next   six months, while some expect no change or a slowdown. Respondents also express   some uncertainty and caution about rising health-care costs, geopolitical instability,   and rising interest rates.
Most First District contacts in manufacturing and related services report that   sales and orders in the second quarter of 2004 were slightly to well above year-earlier   levels. Makers of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment cite particularly large   gains. With some exceptions, companies in technology and office equipment businesses   did not see as much growth in Q2 as they had hoped. Manufacturers of a wide   range of consumer products report new signs of weakness, especially with respect   to their chain-store customers.
Manufacturers report that they have been able to pass along steel price increases   but that they have been only partly successful in recouping higher costs for   raw materials derived from petroleum and natural gas. Transportation costs are   increasing as a result of fuel surcharges and regulation-induced declines in   trucking capacity. Paper prices are up, generally slightly. Some companies are   lowering their costs by sourcing more inputs from Asia, while currency movements   have served to raise the cost of European inputs.
Most manufacturers are holding their U.S. headcounts flat or reducing them   slightly. Some firms are adding to their sales and product design and engineering   workforces. Pay increases are generally running in the 3 percent to 4 percent   range, while increases in health-care costs are much higher. However, biotech   employment is expanding, and industry contacts report that labor markets have   tightened and salary increases are somewhat above the norm in other industries.   There are also scattered reports of delays in filling accounting positions.
Capital spending plans for 2004 tend not to be ambitious. Several companies   report that they plan to reduce expenditures this year or next after completing   major projects. Others are choosing to continue to "hold the line."
The outlook is more mixed than in recent reports. Although many contacts continue   to be optimistic about their business prospects in the coming six to twelve   months, others are concerned about signs of slowdown in consumer and technology   spending.
Residential real estate markets in New England remain strong. Most contacts   report high activity levels, although some have observed slightly fewer potential   buyers in the last two weeks, which they attribute to vacations. In May, Massachusetts   again logged record monthly sales for both single-family homes and condominiums,   while the median selling price reportedly increased about 15 percent from a   year earlier. Home sales in the state have exceeded the year-earlier month in   almost every month during the past year.
Contacts in Vermont and New Hampshire also report double-digit price increases,   but contacts in the rest of New England report either stable prices or more   modest price increases. Sales remain robust throughout the region and inventory   continues to be low. In particular, the lack of affordable housing persists,   although higher-priced homes are staying on the market longer in most areas.   Contacts do not expect any changes in the next few months.
New England-based insurance companies report that their revenues grew moderately   in the second quarter, despite a slowing pace of price increases. Sales of life   insurance exhibit the strongest growth, and disability insurance providers are   seeing a boost from a declining number and duration of disability claims. Sales   of annuities are improving, while reports from property and casualty contacts   are mixed. Demand from outside the United States, especially Asia, is said to   be strong.
Employment is flat or slightly down for most companies, but spending on capital   is somewhat healthier, as some companies seek to keep costs in check while attempting   to boost profitability. Respondents do not expect the second half of 2004 to   be significantly different from the first. Contacts are encouraged by recent   economic news, including the rise in interest rates. Price pressures and the   looming threat of terrorism are ongoing sources of concern.
