Economic growth in the Second District appears to have moderated somewhat since   the last report, though most sectors remain buoyant. While input price pressures   persist, prices of most consumer goods and services have advanced at a relatively   modest pace. The labor market has shown further improvement, though to a lesser   degree than earlier in the year. Retailers report that sales softened in June   and early July, while selling prices were up slightly, due to less discounting.   Business surveys conducted in June and early July suggest some renewed strength   in manufacturing-sector activity, and continued upward pressure on input costs.
The housing market remains strong, though not quite as robust as the spring--the   sales market has moderated a bit, while the rental market has strengthened.   Residential construction remains firm, while construction costs have moderated   somewhat. Office markets in the New York City area were mixed at mid-year. Tourism   has been particularly robust in recent months, with brisk gains in air travel,   hotel occupancy, and theater attendance. Finally, bankers report across-the-board   declines in delinquency rates, slight weakening in household loan demand, but   further increases in demand for business loans.
Consumer confidence was, again, little changed in June. Based on Siena College's   survey of New York State residents, confidence edged down last month, led by   a dip in the New York City area. At the same time, the Conference Board's survey   of Middle Atlantic state (NY, NJ, PA) residents shows confidence rising modestly   in June, reversing a modest dip in May.
Office markets in the New York City area have been mixed. Vacancy rates have   edged down further in Long Island, Fairfield County (Connecticut), and both   Midtown and Lower Manhattan. In contrast, northern New Jersey's vacancy rate   reportedly ended the second quarter at almost 18 percent, the highest level   in nearly a decade. Westchester County's rate rose moderately but was still   lower than a year ago.
Our latest monthly survey of New York State manufacturers indicates further   strength in business conditions in early July; continued widespread increases   in input costs were noted, but only about one in four firms indicate that they   have raised their selling prices. Similarly, June surveys of purchasing managers   in both the New York City and Buffalo areas indicate improved business conditions   in June. Buffalo purchasers report increasingly widespread gains in both production   and new orders, while New York purchasers indicate a resumption in manufacturing   sector growth, following a May lull. Purchasers in both areas again report increasing   input prices, though these were a bit less widespread than in recent months.
Tourism-related industries continue to turn in very strong results. Airport   passenger traffic, year-to-date, is up 15 percent from 2003 levels at New York   City area airports and up 10 percent at both Buffalo-Niagara and Greater Rochester   airports. Manhattan hotels report that revenue was up more than 20 percent from   a year earlier in June, reflecting a 7 percent increase in occupancies and a   14 percent rise in average room rates. Broadway theaters report a further acceleration   in business in June and early July, as total revenues were up roughly 12 percent   from a year earlier; virtually all of the increase reflects higher attendance,   while the average ticket price was little changed.
Loan rates increased across all categories, with the commercial and industrial   segment loan rates registering the most widespread increase. Average deposit   rates are reported to be steady to higher. Credit standards remained unchanged   according to virtually all respondents. Finally, bankers report lower delinquency   rates across all loan categories.
