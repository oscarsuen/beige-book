the last report, though most sectors remain buoyant. While input price pressures
persist, prices of most consumer goods and services have advanced at a relatively
modest pace. The labor market has shown further improvement, though to a lesser
degree than earlier in the year. Retailers report that sales softened in June
and early July, while selling prices were up slightly, due to less discounting.
Business surveys conducted in June and early July suggest some renewed strength
in manufacturing-sector activity, and continued upward pressure on input costs.
The housing market remains strong, though not quite as robust as the spring--the
sales market has moderated a bit, while the rental market has strengthened.
Residential construction remains firm, while construction costs have moderated
somewhat. Office markets in the New York City area were mixed at mid-year. Tourism
has been particularly robust in recent months, with brisk gains in air travel,
hotel occupancy, and theater attendance. Finally, bankers report across-the-board
declines in delinquency rates, slight weakening in household loan demand, but
further increases in demand for business loans.
Consumer Spending
Retail sales, which had been running well ahead of plan during the Spring, slowed
noticeably in June and early July: on a year-over-year basis, same-store sales
gains were mostly in the range of 1 percent to 3 percent in the more recent
period. Contacts attribute the slowing, in part, to unseasonably cool weather;
however, most also characterize the brisk pace of sales earlier this year as
unsustainable and indicate that lean inventories of clearance merchandise have
hampered sales recently. In fact, most retail contacts maintain that inventories
are still on the lean side. Most contacts note that sales of home goods have
softened further, though one describes this category as still strong. In general,
retail contacts indicate that effective selling prices are somewhat higher than
a year ago, due to fewer and smaller markdowns. Retailers report little in the
way of wage pressures, and most continue to indicate that rising energy costs
have little impact on total costs.
Consumer confidence was, again, little changed in June. Based on Siena College's
survey of New York State residents, confidence edged down last month, led by
a dip in the New York City area. At the same time, the Conference Board's survey
of Middle Atlantic state (NY, NJ, PA) residents shows confidence rising modestly
in June, reversing a modest dip in May.
Construction and Real Estate
Housing markets have moderated somewhat since the last report, though they are
still described as strong, particularly in and around New York City. Realtors
in all five boroughs report that home prices were up well over 10 percent in
the second quarter, compared with a year earlier. A Manhattan industry contact
notes that that market for co-ops and condos was fairly robust in June, though
less "frenzied" than in April, when low inventories and strong demand sparked
numerous bidding wars. Manhattan's rental market, in contrast, has continued
to strengthen: one contact notes that a growing number of prospective buyers
have opted to rent in recent weeks and reports that rental rates continue to
rebound and are now roughly on par with a year ago. New Jersey homebuilders
report that demand continues to outstrip supply, keeping prices firm; input
costs remain high but are said to have abated somewhat since the last report.
Office markets in the New York City area have been mixed. Vacancy rates have
edged down further in Long Island, Fairfield County (Connecticut), and both
Midtown and Lower Manhattan. In contrast, northern New Jersey's vacancy rate
reportedly ended the second quarter at almost 18 percent, the highest level
in nearly a decade. Westchester County's rate rose moderately but was still
lower than a year ago.
Other Business Activity
A major New York City employment agency reports continued improvement in the
labor market in June and early July, though at a more gradual pace than in the
last report. There is reported to have been some renewed softening in demand
for IT workers, though this may be partly due to a seasonal slowdown.
Our latest monthly survey of New York State manufacturers indicates further
strength in business conditions in early July; continued widespread increases
in input costs were noted, but only about one in four firms indicate that they
have raised their selling prices. Similarly, June surveys of purchasing managers
in both the New York City and Buffalo areas indicate improved business conditions
in June. Buffalo purchasers report increasingly widespread gains in both production
and new orders, while New York purchasers indicate a resumption in manufacturing
sector growth, following a May lull. Purchasers in both areas again report increasing
input prices, though these were a bit less widespread than in recent months.
Tourism-related industries continue to turn in very strong results. Airport
passenger traffic, year-to-date, is up 15 percent from 2003 levels at New York
City area airports and up 10 percent at both Buffalo-Niagara and Greater Rochester
airports. Manhattan hotels report that revenue was up more than 20 percent from
a year earlier in June, reflecting a 7 percent increase in occupancies and a
14 percent rise in average room rates. Broadway theaters report a further acceleration
in business in June and early July, as total revenues were up roughly 12 percent
from a year earlier; virtually all of the increase reflects higher attendance,
while the average ticket price was little changed.
Financial Developments
Small to medium-sized banks in the district report mixed demand for loans in
the latest survey. Loan demand rose slightly in the commercial segments but
declined slightly in the consumer category. There was a continued widespread
decline in demand for home mortgages: nearly two-thirds of bankers report lower
demand, while only 16 percent report higher demand. Refinancing activity decreased,
according to 52 percent of bankers, with 21 percent reporting an increase.
Loan rates increased across all categories, with the commercial and industrial
segment loan rates registering the most widespread increase. Average deposit
rates are reported to be steady to higher. Credit standards remained unchanged
according to virtually all respondents. Finally, bankers report lower delinquency
rates across all loan categories.
