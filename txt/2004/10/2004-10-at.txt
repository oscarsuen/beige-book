Business contacts indicated that economic activity in the Sixth District moderated during September and early October, in part because of hurricane-related disruptions.  Although merchants' sales were mixed during September because of the storms, most contacts reported that fourth-quarter retail sales are expected to exceed those of a year ago.  The weather also affected residential and commercial building activity, slowing sales and creating material and labor shortages mainly in Florida.  The hurricanes temporarily interrupted factory production in some areas.  Contacts also indicated disruptions to the tourism and hospitality industry, and some uncertainty about the pace of recovery in these industries.  Labor market reports noted strong demand for laborers and specialized construction workers.  Prices remained elevated for building materials and energy.  Farm output was adversely affected by the storms.
Prices for building supplies continued to rise in the region, fueled by hurricane-related demand.  Industry contacts predicted that drywall and roofing shortages would lead to even higher prices during October.  Elevated prices for steel, concrete, and plywood have kept building costs at a high level throughout the District.
