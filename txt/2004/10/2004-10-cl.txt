With some exceptions, growth in economic activity appeared to moderate in the Fourth District through the six weeks ending September.  For most District manufacturers, production levels were steady in late August and September, while sales were weak for most retailers.  Residential construction continued to slow as in recent reports, though nonresidential builders began to see signs of improvement.  District banks reported rising loan demand among their commercial clients, and the transportation sector continued to see strong demand for its services.
Elevated input costs remained a persistent feature of the economic environment.  In addition, plans for increases in hiring and capital spending continued to be isolated.  Staffing services companies reported strong demand for workers with backgrounds in health care and engineering; however, demand from manufacturing firms for workers was weak.
More durable goods producers than in the past--about half--reported that they had higher inventory levels than desired.  Durable goods producers generally planned to reduce capital spending through the next twelve months, and most planned to keep staffing levels stable in the near term.  Few nondurable goods producers planned to hire soon.  Rising input costs continued to confront both durable and nondurable goods manufacturers.  The most prominent increases in input costs were for steel and petroleum-based products.  However, it was reported that the available supply of steel is growing, and that steel price pressures may abate as a result.
Personal care products and accessories continued to sell well, while automobile sales were generally weak throughout the District in September.  Apparel items also sold poorly in recent weeks.  A few contacts noted that unexpectedly warm weather may have dampened demand for fall and winter apparel.  Overall, contacts attributed the slowdown in spending at the District's retailers to uncertainty related to the upcoming presidential election and energy price changes.  Nevertheless, some retailers reported improving sales in early October, while others were optimistic about the approaching holiday selling season.
Outside of energy and health-care costs, price pressures were generally muted at the retail and wholesale levels. For food-service firms and grocers, food prices reportedly stabilized recently, though some produce prices were affected by the recent rash of hurricanes.  Regarding apparel retailers, a few indicated that they have increased markdowns in an attempt to reduce excess inventories.  Generally, however, inventory levels were reported to be the same as or less than those from a year ago.
By contrast, commercial builders began to see some improvement in business conditions in late August and September.  While sales are still at low levels, the economic environment has improved in recent weeks, and sales for most firms are higher than at this time a year ago.  Accordingly, contacts are cautiously optimistic about the future.  Though it is reported that demand came from an array of sectors, a few contacts specifically cited increases in demand for industrial projects.  The increases in materials costs cited by homebuilders also affected commercial builders, and many contacts reported that they cannot completely offset these increases in costs by raising their prices.
