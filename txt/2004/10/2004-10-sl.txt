Reports on economic activity in the Eighth District were mixed in the period since our previous survey, particularly in the manufacturing sector.  The number of manufacturing contacts reporting plans to open plants or expand operations was roughly equal to the number of contacts reporting plans to close plants and lay off workers.  In contrast, contacts in the services sector generally reported strong activity.  Retail and auto sales were flat to slightly down in August with respect to year-earlier levels.  Residential real estate markets continued to do well.  Total loans at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks increased from late June to late September.
In the services sector, most contacts reported an increase in activity since our previous survey.  Firms in the software development and pharmaceutical research, development, and marketing industries reported plans to relocate their headquarters to the District, adding as many as 350 new jobs.  In addition, firms in the military, freight transportation, and financial services industries reported facility openings and renovations that would create almost 900 new jobs.  Despite reports of generally strong activity in the services sector, firms in the automotive maintenance and repair and health care industries are cutting back on their workforce.  Many District auto dealers and general retailers reported flat to slightly down sales in August from the same month a year ago.  Major department and discount chains, in particular, reported slow sales.  Other retailers, including those in the home goods, furniture, and clothing industries reported plans to open new facilities.
Activity in the District's office and industrial real estate markets has been mixed in recent months.  The third quarter office and industrial vacancy rates in the St. Louis metropolitan area experienced little change compared with the previous quarter.  The overall office vacancy rate rose by 10 basis points, while the overall industrial rate fell by 10 basis points.  The office vacancy rate in Bentonville, Ark., increased by 5.3 percentage points to 19.6 percent during the first half of 2004.  The pace of commercial construction continued to increase modestly in most of the Eighth District.  Contacts in north central Arkansas reported a slight increase in construction, and construction activity was steady in southern Indiana.
