The Tenth District economy continued to expand in September and early October.  Retailers posted steady gains, manufacturing activity increased, and labor markets showed further improvement.  Energy activity was very strong, and the housing and agriculture sectors remained solid.  On the negative side, commercial real estate was still weak.  Wage pressures were generally modest, but some price pressures were evident at the wholesale level and for a few retail goods.
