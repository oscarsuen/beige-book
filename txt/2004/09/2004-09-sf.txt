Reports from contacts indicate that economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace in most parts of the District in late July and August.  In recent weeks, contacts cited selected pockets of price inflation, notably for energy, construction supplies, and steel.  Wage pressures remained modest but up slightly overall, boosted by tight supplies of higher-skilled workers.  Retail sales remained strong, as did the demand for services.  Manufacturing activity reportedly picked up for a variety of products.   District providers of agricultural and resource products reported generally solid demand.  Residential real estate activity remained robust, although there were some scattered hints of softening.  Demand for commercial real estate was stable.  District banks reported solid loan demand and good credit quality.
Business conditions for District service providers remained robust.  Demand for advertising, media, and health-care services continued to rise.  High volumes of international trade have kept several District seaports operating at capacity, which in turn has translated into increased demand for dockworkers and rail services.  Conditions in the District travel and tourism sector generally were strong.  Hotel occupancy rates continued to rise in Hawaii, California, and other District markets.  Increases in both domestic and international visitors boosted the tourism sector in Hawaii.
Construction activity generally was robust in most areas, particularly in Hawaii, where the Department of Defense has begun renovations of military housing.  Respondents reported that shortages of some building materials, such as steel and cement, increased construction costs and caused construction delays in some cases.
