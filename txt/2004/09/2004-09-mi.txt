The economy in the Ninth District grew moderately from mid-July through late August. Growth was noted in manufacturing, mining, energy, and consumer spending. Conditions were mixed in tourism, steady in real estate and construction and down in agriculture. District labor markets tightened somewhat from the last report and wage increases were moderate. While overall price increases appear to have been moderate, significant increases were noted for building and manufacturing materials and energy-related products.
Home building and residential real estate were about even with last year's robust activity. Housing units authorized in district states were level for the three-month period ended in July compared with a year ago. An official in Billings, Mont., described the summer building season as about the same as a year ago. A Realtor in the Minneapolis area reported strong sales; however, home sales were down slightly in July compared with a year ago. In western Montana, a bank director reported solid residential real estate activity, particularly sales of condos.
A representative of an automobile dealers association in South Dakota noted that recent vehicle sales were solid, though perhaps slightly down from a year ago.
Summer tourism activity was mixed as cool weather put a damper on travel in some areas. Cool weather slowed travel to northern Minnesota, particularly through mid-July, said a chamber of commerce official. In South Dakota the number of summer visitors appears to be down from last year's strong levels, but those who came were spending robustly, according to a tourism official. In northwestern Wisconsin the number of tourists was up, and the cool weather encouraged more visits to restaurants and retailers near tourist destinations. A bank director noted that summer tourism in western Montana was better than a year ago; the total number of passengers at airports was also higher than last year.
New job announcements included a medical claims company that plans to employ 250 workers in Montana. A window manufacturer in Minnesota was in the process of hiring 300 people, many in temporary positions. In contrast, a Minnesota folding-carton plant will close in December with job losses estimated at 170, a Montana call center laid off 50 employees, and a Wisconsin computer company eliminated 25 positions.
Wage increases remained moderate. A recent contract agreement with workers at mines in Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula included a 9 percent wage increase over the next four years; however, employees and future retirees will share a greater percentage of their health care costs. Sugar beet workers in western Minnesota will receive annual pay raises of 2 percent over three years and will pay only small increases in medical deductibles, according to a recent agreement. Wages for hired workers on farms in Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin were down slightly in July compared with a year ago.
While overall price increases appear to have been moderate, significant increases were noted in manufacturing and building materials and energy-related products. According to the aforementioned Minneapolis Fed survey of manufacturers, 37 percent expect to increase product prices during the second half of 2004, while 8 percent expect to decrease prices. A number of manufacturers and contractors noted higher costs for materials, such as copper, iron, gutters, and carpet. Energy prices were generally higher, including the expected costs to heat homes with natural gas. Diesel fuel prices were recently up 25 percent compared with a year ago. However, gasoline prices in Minnesota near the end of August were up only 3 percent from a year earlier.
