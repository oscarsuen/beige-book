Reports from the Federal Reserve Banks indicated that economic activity continued to expand in late July and August, although several districts indicated that the pace had slowed since their last reports.  Districts' characterizations of the rate of expansion ranged from slow (St. Louis) to solid (San Francisco), with many districts reporting modest or moderate growth.
Household spending was reported to have softened in many parts of the nation, reflecting lackluster retail sales and some cooling in new and existing home sales.  Conditions in the manufacturing sector, on the other hand, improved further nationwide, especially among capital equipment and other durable goods makers.  Residential construction activity remained at high levels but slowed a bit in some regions; nonresidential construction remained tepid, as did demand for commercial and industrial space.  Agricultural conditions were mixed and generally tied to the weather.  Demand for consumer loans softened somewhat, but several districts noted increased commercial lending.  Employers in most districts continued to expand payrolls, though districts reported some unevenness across sectors.  While persistently rapid increases in nonwage labor costs continued to be a concern for many employers, wage pressures remained modest.  Consumer prices were generally flat or up modestly, although there were noticeable price increases for energy and some material inputs.
With respect to autos, sluggish sales, high inventories, or both were noted by contacts in Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas.  St. Louis, San Francisco, and Kansas City, on the other hand, reported improvement in motor vehicle sales.  In terms of composition, Kansas City and Dallas indicated that SUVs and light trucks did not sell as well as smaller vehicles, though the opposite was true in Atlanta and Chicago.
Business conditions in the travel and tourism sector were reported to be strong on balance in the districts of San Francisco, Kansas City, Atlanta, and New York, and in some areas of the Minneapolis and Boston Districts.  Rainy weather in the Northeast and unusually cool weather in northern Minnesota damped travel to those areas.  Hurricane Charley and Tropical Storm Gaston deterred travel and tourism to some coastal areas in the Richmond District.  The Atlanta District noted that most central Florida tourist attractions closed for only one day because of the hurricane, and damage to the theme parks was limited.
The generally robust activity in manufacturing boosted demand for transportation services in many districts.  Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported strong demand for overland shipping services, which resulted in bottlenecks in freight movement in some areas.  According to the San Francisco District, high volumes of international trade kept several West Coast seaports operating at capacity, which also led to increased demand for rail services.  Similarly, New York noted that volume through the Port of New York and New Jersey rose substantially in July and August.
Regarding other services, activity during the survey period was mixed.  St. Louis and San Francisco noted improvement in demand for health-care services; San Francisco also reported improved demand for the services of advertising and media firms.  In contrast, in the Richmond District, service firms reported generally weaker customer demand, and the New York District cited a contact who reported weakened demand in the securities industry.  Boston noted deceleration in demand for software and IT services in late July and August, despite increased demand for IT hardware.
Commercial real estate markets were little changed from the last survey period.  Most districts reported stable but high vacancies and steady but low rents.  That said, there were, scattered reports of improvement.  The New York District reported that the office market in Manhattan strengthened further in July and the Richmond District noted commercial leasing activity increased in the Washington, D.C., area.  Also, the St. Louis District indicated slow improvement in commercial and industrial real estate markets.
Higher energy prices continued to encourage oil and gas extraction.  Kansas City reported that the count of active oil and gas drilling rigs in the region increased slightly from the previous survey period and was up strongly from a year ago.  Oil drilling activity also was reported to have increased in the Dallas District.
On the consumer side, loan demand moderated somewhat in several districts, largely due to a falloff in mortgage lending.  Some districts reported continued moderate increases in consumer loans, but several noted softening demand for home purchase and refinance loans.  In characterizing home loan demand, the Chicago and Kansas City Districts indicated slight increases, and Richmond reported moderate increases.  Cleveland, New York, Dallas, and San Francisco all noted softening in demand for home loans, while Philadelphia described demand for such loans as mixed.
Wage increases remained modest overall, although there were reports of upward wage pressures for selected occupations and industries.  Reports indicated that wage pressures were building for skilled workers, and remaining flat for other types of workers.  District reports continued to note concerns among businesses about the rising cost of health care and other employee benefits.
The reports indicated that consumer prices were generally flat or up modestly in late July and August, although they continued to cite noticeable price increases for oil, natural gas, steel, lumber, cement, concrete, and other building materials.  This characterization of price developments was widespread across the districts.  In addition, Cleveland and Dallas noted price increases for processed foods, and Chicago indicated that higher oil prices have driven up the cost of plastics, rubber, and other petroleum-based materials.  Despite the high oil prices, however, two districts (Minneapolis and Dallas) reported that gasoline prices had increased only moderately if at all.  In this regard, refiners in the Dallas District reported that the steep rise in crude oil prices relative to gasoline has squeezed margins.
