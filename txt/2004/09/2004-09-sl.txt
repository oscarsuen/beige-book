Economic conditions in the Eighth District continued to improve slowly since our last survey.  Many firms in the manufacturing and services sector reported expansions and new hiring.  Some contacts, however, reported closings and layoffs.  Retail sales in June and July decreased compared with year-earlier levels.  Car sales increased over the same period.  Residential real estate markets continued to do well, and commercial markets showed additional signs of improvement.  Overall lending conditions at a sample of District banks were mostly unchanged in the three months ending in July.
Car dealers in the District reported that, compared with last year, sales in June and July were up about 3.5 percent, on average.  About 44 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported increases in sales, while another 44 percent reported decreases.  About 33 percent of the car dealers noted that new car sales had increased, and more than half reported increases in low-end vehicle sales.  About 57 percent of the contacts reported increased use of rebates, while 33 percent reported no change.  Approximately 35 percent of contacts reported a decrease in the acceptance rates of finance applications, while 12 percent reported an increase in acceptance rates.  About 32 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported that their inventories were at desired levels, while 48 percent reported that their inventories were too high.  Nearly 70 percent of the car dealers surveyed expect increasing sales this fall.
The District's services sector has improved in many areas.  Firms in the aviation, consumer products distribution, freight transportation, travel and tourism, general retail, and health care services sectors reported expansions and new hiring.  In contrast, firms in the banking and education services sectors reported office closures and workforce reductions.  An automotive maintenance and repair services union group is on strike in the St. Louis area.  Car dealers suggested that, although the strike has not affected vehicle sales, it has negatively affected maintenance and repair services at the dealerships where workers are striking.
The office and industrial real estate markets are improving slowly in most of the District.  The overall office vacancy rate in Louisville's central business district fell to 20.3 percent in the second quarter from 21.4 percent in the first quarter.  Both office and industrial vacancy rates decreased slightly in the greater St. Louis area compared with this year's first quarter.  The overall vacancy rate fell to 16.8 percent from 17.1 percent, and the overall industrial rate fell to 6.6 percent from 6.8 percent.  Commercial construction is also improving in most of the Eighth District.  Contacts in southern Indiana noted that commercial construction has remained stable and that it is still growing in north central Arkansas.
Agriculture and Natural Resources
Dry conditions and cooler-than-normal temperatures have slowed the development of soybeans and cotton in some parts of the District.  Corn and soybean development in each District state remains on pace with or ahead of their five-year averages.  The corn harvest has begun in southern regions of the District.  The pace of cotton growth in the District and the pace of sorghum growth in Missouri have fallen behind normal.  District crops, including corn, soybeans, sorghum, cotton, rice, and tobacco, are mostly in good condition; however, some soybean fields in Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri suffer from Sudden Death Syndrome, a fungal disease.  Pastures throughout the District would benefit from more rain, and livestock remains in good condition.
