Reports on economic activity from across the Fourth District were mixed in the eight weeks ending in mid-August.  Activity continued to slow in some sectors, while others saw sales and production rebound in recent weeks.  For most District manufacturers, production remained well above year-ago levels; however, increases in activity in recent weeks were largely confined to durable goods producers.  In the retail sector, sales continued to be weak for most firms.  Residential construction also continued to slow somewhat in recent weeks, and nonresidential builders continued to confront weak demand.  By contrast, District banks reported steady loan demand from commercial and consumer clients alike, although mortgage refinancings remain weak.  The transportation sector continued to report robust rates of activity.
As has been the case for many months, elevated input costs continued to confront firms for items such as steel, food, and petroleum products.  Plans to add equipment and employees are still not broad based; however, companies that provide staffing services reported an increase in openings and placements in the last several weeks.
While most durable goods manufacturers characterized their inventory levels as acceptable, several nondurable goods manufacturers indicated that their inventory levels were higher than desired.  Moreover, while durable goods manufacturers indicated increases in utilization rates, nondurable goods manufacturers noted that their utilization rates were flat or falling slightly.  Finally, most durable goods manufacturers expect to add to payrolls and to their capital stock in the next few months; however, nondurable goods manufacturers remained less likely to report plans to expand levels of employment or equipment.
Input costs continued to be a concern for most manufacturers.  Prices paid by District manufacturers for petroleum-based products and for steel and other metals reportedly rose further in recent weeks.  Food processing firms also again reported increases in the prices for some foods, including milk, chicken, and beef.  Durable goods producers reported raising prices to largely offset increases in input costs; however, nondurable goods producers were less able to pass input cost increases along to their consumers.
Firms reported fewer markdowns, in part from more strictly managed inventories.  Compensation costs continued to be a concern for many firms, especially with respect to health care costs.  For food-service firms and grocers, higher prices for food products were also reported again.  In general, however, other input price pressures remain muted.
New car sales were generally weaker across the District in the eight weeks ending in mid-August.  Some contacts cited seasonal factors for the slowdown.  After attempts to reduce incentives earlier in the year, incentives are again at high levels.  Finally, contacts indicated that inventories are at about a 90-day supply.
Most nonresidential building contacts reported a recent slowing in inquiries and activity across nearly all building categories, continuing the pattern of recent months.  Whatever improvement was reported appeared to be among smaller-scale projects, which were often industrial in nature.  Year-over-year comparisons were more mixed.  Contacts generally reported that their materials costs increased in the last six weeks, though less rapidly than earlier this year.  Labor and subcontractor costs were generally unchanged, as were the prices charged by commercial contractors.  Most firms do not anticipate much change in the economic environment in the months ahead.
