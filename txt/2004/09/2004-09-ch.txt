The Seventh District economy continued to expand in late July and August, albeit at a slightly slower pace. On balance, consumer spending appeared to soften somewhat during the period. Business spending continued to increase, but the pace of hiring slowed. Construction activity also decelerated somewhat, but remained robust. Manufacturing activity again expanded solidly. Overall lending activity was relatively soft, despite a slight pickup in residential mortgage applications. Persistently high energy and materials prices were the primary cost concerns among business contacts, but there was little to suggest that these higher costs had become embedded in inflationary expectations. The District's agricultural situation was mixed again, as crop conditions remained well above year-ago levels while most agricultural product prices declined.
