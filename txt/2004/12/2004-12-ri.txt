The Fifth District economy expanded at a moderate pace in late October through   mid November though there were increasing signs that retail sales and manufacturing   were losing momentum. District services businesses generally reported solid   revenue growth since our last report but retailers said sales barely increased   and employment in the sector was flat. Manufacturers said both shipments and   new orders expanded somewhat more slowly in October and softened in early November.   Housing markets continued to show healthy growth since our last report, although   the pace of expansion was less robust than in late summer. In contrast, commercial   real estate conditions brightened considerably from the lackluster pace seen   earlier in the year. District manufacturers continued to face higher prices   for some raw materials, notably oil, gas, and steel, and contacts said that   they were not able to fully pass along the higher costs. Business contacts generally   reported that prices for their products and services continued to rise only   modestly. In agriculture, heavy rainfall hampered harvesting activity, but contacts   expected near-record corn and soybean crops.
Commercial real estate conditions brightened throughout the Fifth District   during the past six weeks. Agents stated that the recent improvement had been   driven primarily by increased leasing of new retail and office space--much of   it by expanding small businesses. "The calls we are getting are from people   who want to take their businesses out of their homes and other small spaces   and move to somewhere they can grow," noted a contact in Raleigh, N.C. Contacts   also noticed "some early signals" of a recovery in industrial leasing. Realtors   in Charleston, W.V., Charlotte and Greensboro, N.C., Columbia, S.C., and Washington,   D.C., mentioned a rise in industrial activity. The leasing of smaller spaces   called "warehouse condos" was particularly strong. Adding to the recent upbeat   tone, vacancies across all sectors edged lower and rents held steady. Despite   firmer demand, office and industrial construction remained stagnant while retail   construction maintained its steady pace.
