The Ninth District experienced broad-based growth from October through mid-November.   Signs of growth were noted in most areas: consumer spending, manufacturing,   construction, energy, mining and agriculture. Tourism was about even with a   year ago. Labor markets tightened and wage increases were modest. Price increases   appeared in a number of sectors including manufacturing, construction and energy.
An auto dealer in Minnesota reported that October was generally slow for traffic   and sales compared with a year ago; November started a little stronger.
Autumn tourism activity was about even with a year ago. The number of visitors   at tourism destinations in the Black Hills of South Dakota during September   and October was down slightly compared with a year ago; however, revenue was   up slightly. Fall outdoor activities were strong in northwestern Wisconsin,   although retail sales slowed somewhat, according to a chamber of commerce representative.
Residential markets continued at a strong pace. A mortgage broker in Fargo-Moorhead   reported she expects another record year. Despite some small corrections in   the Minneapolis-St. Paul area--longer market times, higher inventory and fewer   closings--sales continue at a strong pace. A Minnesota bank director noted residential   construction was strong, with a mixed outlook. However, realtors in the Duluth-Superior   area noted movements toward a buyer's market.
In contrast, a Minnesota-based company that makes recordable tape, CD and DVD   products plans to cut 250 jobs companywide, with many of the layoffs taking   place at its headquarters. The closing of a Minnesota call center, due to company   consolidation, will affect 70 jobs.
Increases in wages and salaries were modest. Bank directors in Montana mentioned   moderate increases in wages and salaries in several parts of the state. Wage   and salary growth in 2005 is expected to be subdued; 78 percent of respondents   to the Minneapolis Fed's business poll expect wage increases to range from 2   percent to 3 percent.
Price increases appeared in several sectors, including manufacturing, construction   and energy. Preliminary results of the Minneapolis Fed's business poll indicate   some higher expectations for prices, as 48 percent of respondents expect to   increase prices for their products in 2005, up from 31 percent in last year's   poll. Several construction and manufacturing materials prices increased, such   as aluminum, concrete, copper, diesel fuel and steel products. Softwood prices   decreased since the last report, but were still about 15 percent higher than   a year ago. Pork prices were up about 15 percent from last year.
