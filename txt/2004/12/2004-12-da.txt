Eleventh District economic activity appears to have accelerated slightly from
mid-October to mid-November. Manufacturing and business service activity continued
to slowly strengthen. Retail sales and construction were mixed. Financial institutions
report continued improvement in conditions. Energy activity is up. Agricultural
conditions remain mostly favorable. Many respondents noted relief that the election
was over, explaining that it wasn't because one candidate won over another as
much as the elimination of uncertainty.
Prices
There were many reports of higher prices but also reports of downward price
pressures. Energy prices remain relatively high after spiking and then declining
slightly. Higher costs for energy and other inputs remain a concern for most
respondents. Some say they are increasing selling prices enough to make up for
the cost increases. Others say competitive pressures, both domestic and international,
are making that difficult. Contacts say import competition, particularly from
China, is keeping downward price pressure on some manufactured products, such
as apparel and fabricated metals.
After surging to near $56 per barrel on the spot market, crude prices dropped
to slightly below those reported in the last Beige Book. Crude inventories are
now near the five-year average level for November, helped by a surge of imports
that had been delayed by Gulf Coast hurricanes. Private forecasts of a cold
winter and spiking heating oil prices pushed spot natural gas prices to near
$8 per million Btu in early November, but prices fell to near $7 per million
Btu as natural gas storage rose to record levels.
With the possibility of stronger than normal seasonal demand for heating oil,
contacts report concerns about heating oil production for the coming winter.
Refiners have been in a significant turnaround period, and operating rates in
October were below normal even for the fall maintenance season. Heating oil
inventories have fallen to levels near the bottom of the five-year range. Heating
oil prices have been whipsawed by uncertainty about the ability to refill inventories
before winter arrives.
Selling prices are up for most chemical products. Producers say heavy demand
is helping them pass along significant cost increases, primarily from energy,
but also from shipping and other material inputs. Metals producers say selling
prices are up slightly because of steep cost increases for aluminum, scrap metal,
nickel and alloy.
Some producers express concerns about the effects of a weaker dollar, noting
that increased costs for imported materials are pushing up prices for final
products. Other contacts say they are not affected by changes in the value of
the dollar because they do much of their transactions in dollars or in currencies
that are pegged to the dollar.
Retailers anticipate the January 2005 elimination of import quotas for textiles
to lower imported textile prices by as much as 13 percent to 18 percent. This
reduction is expected to be reflected in prices for spring merchandise. Retailers
do not expect to reduce selling prices. They say lower costs will translate
into "more normal" profits and an improved quality of merchandise.
Labor Market
There are few reports of hiring or wage increases, although higher benefit costs,
particularly for health care, remain a pervasive concern. Temporary service
firms say they hope to push through higher fees to offset an increase in the
Texas state unemployment insurance tax that they have been told is likely in
January 2005.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity increased for most products. Demand was up for fabricated
metals, high-tech, food and energy-related products. Sales remained strong for
construction-related products, such as lumber, clay, cement, brick and glass,
but contacts are cautious about slowing demand for housing.
Sales of primary metals declined slightly over the past couple of months, leading
to a few shift reductions but no major layoffs. While contacts noted some continued
effect from the hurricanes, they say there was also increased competition from
Chinese imports. Sales of paper products have been lower than expected for this
time of year, which contacts attribute to loss of market share to overseas producers.
Demand for food products increased some over the past month. Apparel producers
say demand has been unchanged over the past month but is up from three months
ago. Apparel manufacturers are very concerned about China's import quota ending
next year.
High-tech manufacturers report that production and orders continue to grow
at a good pace. Contacts say retailers have built inventories of IT products
in expectations of healthy Christmas spending and there may be some shortages
if sales are very strong.
Demand was up for energy-related manufacturers, including producers of oilfield
hardware, tools and well-bore equipment, who reported higher prices, sales and
margins. Demand for chemicals is extremely strong, particularly for products
such as ethylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, chlorine,
and caustic soda. Export demand for petrochemicals was very strong, based on
favorable natural-gas-to-oil-price ratio, a weaker dollar, and significant operating
problems in Europe and Venezuela. Refiners' margins have steadily improved in
recent weeks, coming back from a significant decline in margins in late summer.
Services
Demand for temporary staffing firms picked up in most parts of the district.
Demand strengthened for light industrial manufacturing, administrative and clerical
work, according to contacts, but demand remained weak in the financial services
sector. There were reports of temporary workers being made permanent, which
contacts said was unusual for this time of the year.
Demand for legal services has been strong in the past month, and contacts say
activity is up compared with a year ago. Accounting firms report that demand
remains very strong and increasing, mostly due to the increased needs of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Accounting firms report substantial hiring, particularly
for auditors and risk management professionals. Salaries for these types of
professionals have increased by as much as 7 percent to 8 percent this year.
High fuel costs continue to plague transportation service firms. Railroads
report high loads, particularly to carry metallic ores, metals, wood, building
products and domestic consumer goods. The airline industry continues to suffer
from too much capacity and no pricing power, forcing them to absorb all cost
pressures. Contacts say that restructuring is being impaired by bankrupt carriers
that continue to operate below total costs, pulling down healthier carriers.
Retail Sales
Sales growth increased for retailers selling to upper-and middle-income consumers,
with particularly strong sales of high-end products, such as HDTVs and jewelry.
Respondents attributed the increase in sales to lower gasoline prices, greater
job security and reduced geopolitical concerns. Sales growth was "disappointing"
for retailers selling to the lower-income consumers. Contacts say that these
consumers are still feeling the strain of high gasoline prices and health care
costs. Automobile sales remain soft, down slightly from year ago levels, with
inventories higher than desired.
Construction and Real Estate
Housing sales and prices softened slightly over the past six weeks. Existing
home sales tapered off, and homebuilders say traffic has slowed and they are
offering more concessions. Many homebuilders report that sales are still above
last year's levels, but inventories continue to rise. Housing industry contacts
are optimistic for 2005, but say a stronger rate of job growth is needed to
meet sales expectations.
The continued construction of new units is weighing down apartment markets
in Dallas and Houston. Occupancy levels in Austin and San Antonio have improved,
but contacts remain cautious about the outlook because of the amount of construction
proposed and underway. Office markets improved over the past six weeks. Respondents say leasing activity
continued to pick up slowly. Existing tenants are expanding lease space, as
companies and take advantage of low rental rates. Tremendous capital market
activity continues. Office construction remains very low, with most being build-to-suit
or government funded.
Financial Services
Deposit growth was flat to up. Commercial and industrial lending activity appears
to be picking up, but contacts report that lingering uncertainty about the economy
is still slowing some investment. Some contacts expressed concerns that higher
interest rates are slowing lending, particularly to small business. Mortgage
lending was flat to down.
Energy
U.S. crude oil demand has been near or slightly below what is expected for this
time of year. The domestic rig count increased over the past six weeks, with
most of the gains directed to oil. More land rigs are under construction, and
some are being upgraded to support faster and deeper drilling. International
drilling also rose in November, particularly in the North Sea. (Data show that
international activity fell sharply in October, but contacts believe it was
a statistical aberration because an unusual number of rigs were in transit instead
of working.) Conditions in the oil field services and machinery sectors are
improving, and most segments of the industry are busy and enjoying higher prices,
growing backlogs of work and equipment orders, and expectations that their markets
will remain strong.
Contacts report capacity constraints in some areas, but there appears to be
potential for continued expansion in oilfield equipment manufacturing, oilfield
construction and shallow offshore drilling. There have been some reports of
short supplies of steel products in the oil patch--including drill pipe, downhole
tubing, and anything made of stainless steel. Most respondents noted capacity
constraints in labor-intensive oilfield services where people have to be especially
well trained and qualified--such as fracturing, pressure pumping or tubular
makeup. In addition, rental rates have improved for rigs capable of drilling
deep water because many rigs were moved to other areas of the world that promised
greater returns. The oilfield services that could not leave with the rigs--such
as downhole fluids, supply boats, and helicopter services--are in excess supply.
Agriculture
Rain improved soil moisture conditions but halted planting and harvest in some
areas. Supplemental feeding of livestock was active in the wet parts of the
district. Estimates of Texas cotton production were revised up to 7.7 million
bales, this will be an increase of 78 percent from 2003 and 27 percent from
the record 1949 harvest. Strong U.S. production has pushed down prices for cotton,
soybeans and corn. Contacts say demand is unchanged for most crops, but they
hope that the weaker U.S. dollar may boost exports. Strong demand for calves
and feeder cattle continue to boost cattle prices.
