The Twelfth District economy expanded solidly in October and early November,   maintaining the pace of growth of the previous survey period. In terms of inflation,   retailers reported stable prices despite increasing costs and makers of IT products   noted ongoing price declines for many of their goods and services. Other contacts   continued to comment on the higher cost of energy, shipping, and building materials.   Wage increases remained modest, but rising benefits costs continued to push   up total compensation. Retail sales reportedly were solid and demand for District   services remained strong. District manufacturing activity was mixed, with some   sectors reporting solid growth and others noting some softening. District agricultural   producers reported strong demand for most products. Activity in District residential   real estate markets generally was robust, with slight moderation in some areas.   Contacts indicated modest improvements in commercial real estate; office and   industrial vacancy rates fell slightly in several markets. District banking   and financial conditions were little changed, with solid overall loan demand   and good credit quality.
Contacts reported robust demand for District services. District seaports continued   to handle very high volumes, boosted by surging imports and a pickup in exports.   The volume of traffic, especially on the import side, has caused considerable   congestion, resulting in a backlog of unloaded inbound ships in southern California.   Contacts reported that shipping lines recently increased their prices for ground   and sea transport in response to the bottlenecks. District travel and tourism   also has been vigorous, with increases in both domestic and international traffic.   Contacts noted improvements in hotel occupancy and increases in average daily   room rates in many markets.
