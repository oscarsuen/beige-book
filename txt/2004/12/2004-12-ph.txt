Manufacturers   anticipate increases in shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers   expect sales for the Christmas shopping season this year to exceed last year's   by a moderate amount. Auto dealers expect sales to be level through December.   Bankers believe overall lending will remain on the rise, although they anticipate   a slowing in growth of residential mortgage activity. Real estate agents and   home builders expect home sales to remain close to the current pace. Contacts   in commercial real estate expect the demand for office and industrial space   to rise gradually during 2005.
The region's manufacturers generally expect further gains in business activity.   Around six out of ten of the firms surveyed in November expect their shipments   and orders to increase during the next six months, and less than one in ten   expect decreases. On balance, area manufacturing firms are scheduling increases   in capital spending and planning to add employees. Despite mixed reports on   current conditions among the region's major manufacturing sectors, the outlook   is positive in almost all of them.
Third District manufacturers continued to report rising prices, with about   the same percentage of firms noting increases during November as in October.   Area manufacturers expect further increases in input and output prices during   the next six months. They also anticipate sharp increases in the cost of employee   health benefits for 2005.
Auto dealers in the region reported roughly steady sales in November at around   the same rate as in October. Manufacturers have stepped up promotions, and dealers   expect that a year-end marketing push will maintain the sales rate close to   its current pace through December.
Investment companies and stock brokers in the region have been receiving strong   cash inflows. Some indicated that growth in business has been steady since midyear,   and others said the increase has been recent. In response to the expanded activity,   some securities firms are raising staffing levels.
Residential real estate agents indicated that sales have been roughly steady   in recent weeks. Homebuilders also reported steady sales. Price appreciation   continues for existing homes, and builders in many parts of the region have   been raising prices for new homes. Real estate agents in some areas said there   has been a slight increase in the amount of time houses are on the market before   being sold, but most residential real estate contacts indicated that demand   continues to be strong. Both builders and real estate agents expect the pace   of sales to remain roughly steady. They anticipate rising employment and incomes   to cushion the effect of potential increases in mortgage interest rates as long   as the upturn in rates does not exceed one or two percentage points.
