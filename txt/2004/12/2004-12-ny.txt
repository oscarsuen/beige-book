The Second District's economy has taken on a somewhat firmer tone since the       last report, though a few areas remain sluggish. Cost pressures persist, but       prices of final goods and services, aside from energy, remain stable. Labor       markets continued to improve, on balance. Manufacturers indicate that activity       remains on a moderate upward trajectory, and most contacts remain optimistic       about the outlook for early 2005. In contrast, retailers report that sales were       below plan in October, though a few note signs of a pickup in early November.
Commercial real estate markets have softened a bit since the last report, but   housing markets remain robust. In New York City, tourism has shown signs of   strengthening in recent weeks, reportedly buoyed by a pickup in both international   and business travelers. Securities industry activity has picked up noticeably   since the last report. Bankers report slight slowing in loan demand, unchanged   credit standards and little change in delinquency rates.
Consumer confidence was mixed in October. Based on Siena College's survey of   New York State residents, confidence rose modestly, led by a strong pickup in   upstate New York. However, the Conference Board's survey of Middle Atlantic   state (NY, NJ, PA) residents shows confidence slipping in October.
The market for New York City co-ops and condos has been brisk in recent weeks:   one contact reports that volume has been running noticeably higher than a year   ago since Labor Day and that prices are up roughly 5 percent from a year ago;   another contact reports a surge in sales at the very high end (multi-million   dollar homes), and also a further pickup in sales of smaller (1-bedroom and   studio) apartments. Manhattan's rental market has been mixed but generally stronger,   led by the downtown area, where there is reported to be strong demand and a   limited inventory.
Office markets have slackened somewhat since the last report. Manhattan's office   market was steady to slightly softer in October, as brisk leasing activity was   more than offset by an increased flow of available space onto the market. Midtown   Manhattan's vacancy rate held steady and asking rents edged up again. However,   downtown's vacancy rate jumped to its highest level this year, and asking rents   dipped. Albany's office market also showed signs of softening, with vacancy   rates up roughly a point from a year ago; also, a jump in prices of building   materials is reportedly making it more costly to refit office space for new   tenants.
Manufacturers indicate steady, moderate growth in business activity, and continue   to express widespread optimism about the outlook for the first half of 2005.   The greatest concern expressed by manufacturers is increased competition from   overseas; a few contacts also indicate that customers have recently been taking   longer to pay their accounts. Among businesses more generally, rising energy   prices appear to be the top concern. Purchasing managers in the Buffalo and   New York City areas similarly report moderate improvement in activity, and fairly   widespread increases in commodity prices.
Tourism has shown increased signs of strength in New York City. Airports report   a strong increase in international arrivals, compared with 2003. There are also   signs of a rebound in business travel. Manhattan hotels report that both occupancy   rates and room rates were running well ahead of a year earlier in October, which   is typically the top month for conferences and business travel. Moreover, bookings   for most of December and next January are reported to be robust, with fewer   hotels offering discounts. An industry contact projects that room rates will   increase 12 percent in 2005, following a 9-10 percent rise in 2004. Attendance   and revenues at Broadway theaters showed signs of rebounding in mid-November,   after falling behind comparable 2003 levels in October and early November.
