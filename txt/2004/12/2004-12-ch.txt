The Seventh District economy continued to expand at a moderate pace from late   October through mid-November. Consumer spending remained relatively soft, but   business spending continued to pick up. Construction and real estate activity   was largely the same as at the time of our last report. Manufacturing continued   to be robust, with contacts reporting further gains in production, new orders,   and backlogs. Bankers said that demand increased slightly for both household   and business loans. High input costs persisted, but retail price pressures were   largely subdued. Agriculture prospects remained strong, with bumper corn and   soybean harvests.
Consumer spending remained relatively soft from late October through mid-November.   Retailers generally indicated that sales nationwide were coming in at the lower   end of their expectations, with the Midwest softer than other regions. However,   some said that store traffic and sales of seasonal merchandise picked up as   temperatures cooled. Despite stronger job growth and higher consumer confidence,   merchants' expectations for the holiday shopping season remained somewhat cautious.   Retail inventories were said to be in line with sales plans. Many restaurants,   from quick-casual to high-end, noted stronger sales during the reporting period.   One property manager noted that restaurants were benefiting from a general upswing   in shopping center traffic. District auto dealers said that light vehicle sales   were relatively soft in early November, which was in line with expectations,   and that inventories were slightly high. Once again, tourism and related spending   was reported to be a bit above year-earlier levels.
Business spending continued to increase and more firms appeared to be hiring.   Many businesses reportedly boosted outlays for production machinery, office   equipment, and computers. Still, contacts again suggested that a large portion   of capital outlays was devoted to replacing outdated or worn equipment and/or   cost-saving technologies, rather than expanding productive capacity. Business   travel and advertising continued to rise modestly. With regard to hiring, one   large temporary help firm indicated that new orders increased significantly   in October and early November after falling off in September. This firm, and   others, noted that demand for temporary workers was strong across industry and   occupational categories. In addition, temp-to-permanent placement fees continued   to rise. Outside of temporary help firms, reports of additional permanent hiring   became more frequent, particularly from manufacturers.
On balance, there was little discernible change in real estate and construction   activity in recent months, as some slowing in housing markets was offset by   a slight strengthening on the nonresidential side. Though reports were mixed,   Realtors and builders generally indicated that housing markets remained strong   even though sales were a little slower than earlier in the year. However, a   contact with one builders' association suggested that most homebuilders were   expecting mortgage interest rates to rise next year, heightening uncertainty   among many of them. Commercial construction and real estate activity continued   to increase slightly. Despite recent gains in office markets, contacts still   described it as "a tenants' market," with leases containing higher-than-normal   improvement allowances and rent abatements.
Manufacturing activity continued to increase. Producers of heavy equipment (construction,   agricultural, and mining) again reported considerable ongoing strength in production,   new orders, and backlogs. One contact suggested that tax incentives set to expire   at the end of the year may be pulling ahead orders for heavy equipment. New   orders for heavy trucks were "at extremely strong levels" and production was   constrained by shortages of engines and other parts. Machine tool makers said   that new orders increased further from very high levels. Shipments of cement   and gypsum wallboard continued to rise, and industry contacts said that some   firms had added capacity, or planned future additions, to keep up with demand.   Some specialty steel products were said to be in short supply. More generally,   however, demand for domestically produced steel eased somewhat recently, due   in large part to an increase in imports and softening demand from the auto industry.   Light vehicle sales nationwide were said to be "tepid" in early November, and   inventories were rising again. As a result, one producer indicated that fourth-quarter   production schedules probably will be cut.
On balance, lending activity increased slightly from our last report. On the   household side, some lenders reported an uptick in mortgage loan applications   as long-term interest rates remained historically low. There were no changes   reported on standards and terms for household loans, and credit quality continued   to improve. Demand for business loans increased slightly. One large bank reported   that its October increase in commercial loan volumes was one of the strongest   this year. In addition, commercial credit line usage increased. Still, overall   lending remained well below expectations. There were no reported changes on   standards and terms for business loans, and lenders said that credit quality   was good and largely unchanged.
Reports of higher input costs persisted and wages continued to increase at a   slightly faster pace, but retail price pressures remained largely subdued. Contacts   reported that prices for some materials were decreasing. Notably, steel prices   were reported to have declined from relatively high levels, and lumber prices   also fell in recent months, alleviating cost pressures on homebuilders. Still,   many materials prices remained elevated. The number of firms that were able   to pass higher input costs along to their business customers continued to rise,   although the price increases appeared modest. Some restaurants were said to   be raising menu prices to offset higher food costs. Still, price increases for   final consumer goods remained largely contained.
Harvest was nearing completion in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa, but still lagged   in Michigan and Wisconsin, especially for corn. Corn and soybean harvests for   most District states were likely to approach or set record highs, and concerns   about storage of the bumper crops persisted. Precipitation replenished depleted   soil moisture levels in parts of the District, but also delayed field work and   boosted the moisture content of grain stored outside. Fertilizer prices have   increased substantially which, along with higher fuel costs, have tempered gains   in farm income, even as government payments provided a boost. Soybean rust,   recently discovered in the South, has become a major concern in the District,   with planting decisions likely to heavily favor corn over soybeans next year.   Livestock producers have benefited from lower feed costs and continued to make   a profit.
