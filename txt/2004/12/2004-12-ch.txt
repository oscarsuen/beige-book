The Seventh District economy continued to expand at a moderate pace from late   October through mid-November. Consumer spending remained relatively soft, but   business spending continued to pick up. Construction and real estate activity   was largely the same as at the time of our last report. Manufacturing continued   to be robust, with contacts reporting further gains in production, new orders,   and backlogs. Bankers said that demand increased slightly for both household   and business loans. High input costs persisted, but retail price pressures were   largely subdued. Agriculture prospects remained strong, with bumper corn and   soybean harvests.
