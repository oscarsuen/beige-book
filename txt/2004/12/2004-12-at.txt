Business contacts reported that the pace of economic activity increased in   October and early November. Hurricane-related disruptions have subsided outside   of the worst affected areas, and rebuilding efforts have boosted activity in   several building related industries. Passenger vehicle sales continued to lag,   whereas other retailers reported modest improvements in sales and most expressed   cautious optimism toward the holiday season. By most accounts, housing markets   remained strong and the nonresidential segment displayed small improvements.   Manufacturing reports were quite positive, and the demand for transportation   services was strong. However, several Gulf of Mexico oil and gas pipelines remained   off-line because of storm damage. The tourism and hospitality sector reports   were mixed, varying by their location relative to the path of the hurricanes.   The demand for construction workers was very strong in the storm-affected areas,   and additional hiring was noted in manufacturing industries supplying building   materials. Higher prices were reported for building materials, energy, and some   food produce, the latter pushed up because of storm damage to several Florida   crops.
Prices for building materials and energy remained at high levels, according   to most reports. Building costs continued to rise for wood, steel, concrete,   gypsum board, shingles, and shutters. Price increases for reinforced and structural   steel were also reported, in part because of increased overseas demand. Delivery   surcharges by building supply businesses and transporters were widely reported.
