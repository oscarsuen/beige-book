The economy appears to be improving in the First                   District. Retail activity reportedly picked up in the closing                   months of 2003, and travel and tourism are said to be strengthening.                   Demand for products of most contacted District manufacturers                   was higher in the fourth quarter than a year earlier. With the                   exception of cost increases for some metals, wood products,                   and oil and gas-related items, prices are generally stable or                   falling. Residential real estate markets in New England remain                   strong. Insurance activity has leveled out. Hiring plans in                   most sectors are modest, but contacts report no planned layoffs.
Leisure travel has reportedly picked up in northern                   New England, as skiing attracted many travelers in December.                   Contacts note that international bookings look positive for                   the upcoming months, as the weak dollar attracts travelers and                   airlines offer promotional fares. Domestic travelers continue                   to favor drive-to destinations and last minute trips. Though                   occupancy rates in the accommodations sector have reportedly                   improved compared to recent months, revenues are not increasing                   at the same rate -- most travelers are choosing moderately priced                   motels with "package" deals over pricier accommodations. In                   the Boston area, corporate entertaining is said to have strengthened                   in December compared to a year earlier, and bookings for corporate                   meetings in early 2004 have also improved.
Most retail contacts are optimistic about 2004                   and foresee continued improvements in the coming months. While                   some respondents are pleased by the stock market and consumers'                   willingness to make big-ticket purchases, they express concern                   about potential terrorist attacks and rising interest rates.
Most selling prices remain flat to down. In some                   cases, manufacturers have been able to counteract downward pressures                   by introducing innovative products. By contrast, costs for copper                   and oil and gas derivatives are reportedly sharply higher than                   a year ago.
A biotech company is making large additions to                   its workforce, but most other contacts are making only modest                   increases or modest decreases to their U.S. headcounts. Any                   new hiring tends to be focused on professional and technical                   positions, and is often connected to new product development,                   sales, or support. Pay increases are expected to average 2 percent                   to 4 percent in 2004, about the same as in 2003.
Most manufacturers anticipate that their capital                   spending will be modestly higher in 2004 than in 2003. Although                   life sciences companies are adding to their overall capacity,                   most contacts' capital plans are motivated by the desire to                   lower the cost of production, improve maintenance of their capital                   stock, or change their product mix. Various contacts report                   that they are continuing to be cautious in their capital spending.
Manufacturing respondents are generally anticipating                   that revenues will increase in the coming year, but despite                   their increased optimism they remain uncertain about the strength                   or durability of the recovery. Contacts in textiles and paper                   products express particular concern about their sectors.
Markets in the rest of New England have been                   stable; most contacts report steady prices and modestly active                   markets. Inventory has started to build in some areas, creating                   more "normal" markets, compared to extreme shortages many states                   experienced in the past couple of years. High-end homes, in                   particular, remain on the market longer, while low- and mid-priced                   homes sell quickly in most places. Contacts report typical seasonal                   slowdowns and expect that activity will pick up pace in the                   spring.
While no layoffs loom in the first quarter of                   2004, hiring remains subdued; however, capital budgets are beginning                   to expand as companies start to renew postponed capital projects.                   Respondents expect the first quarter of 2004 to be largely flat                   due to slower sales growth in the continental U.S. No major                   price changes are expected in 2004, in contrast to much of the                   past year.
