According to commercial realtors, leasing activity in the Fifth District picked up over the final two months of 2003. "Conditions are surprisingly good here--the year finished with a flurry," noted a contact in Columbia, S.C., where leasing activity in office, retail, and industrial space was strengthening notably. Activity was also on the upswing in Charlotte, N.C., where a realtor reported increased interest in industrial space. Strong conditions continued in the Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Va., retail markets--the Washington, D.C., contact was "pretty upbeat" about leasing activity and a Richmond realtor reported "smooth sailing" over the past two months. Overall, rents held firm and vacancies were down slightly across the District.
