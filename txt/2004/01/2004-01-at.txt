Vehicle sales in November and December were mixed, according to reports from auto dealers.  Some contacts noted that December is traditionally a low-volume month, although foreign model sales were quite strong late in the year.  Most contacts reported that a reduction in the level of incentives had not significantly reduced sales or floor traffic at dealerships.
District trucking contacts continued to report gains in seasonal freight demand late in the year.  Airfreight tonnage improved from year-earlier levels for both domestic and international cargo in Atlanta and Miami.
Most reports indicated that businesses were not raising prices.  But one report did note that increases in raw material costs were being passed on to customers, whereas wage and benefit increases were not being passed on.  Prices for timber products remained high because of relatively low supplies and strong housing construction activity in the District.
