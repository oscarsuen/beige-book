Despite a pickup in hiring, wage and salary pressures in the District remained modest in recent weeks.  However, contacts noted that, as job markets have improved, companies have found it more difficult to shift increases in healthcare premiums, workers compensation insurance premiums, and other employee-related costs to workers.  As a result, the growth rate of total employee compensation has edged up for many employers.
Business conditions for District service providers continued to improve, with several noting firmer demand.  Advertising and marketing firms reported a rise in contracts for print and radio advertising campaigns.  Demand also strengthened for accounting and legal firms, stimulated by interest in corporate pension planning and tax preparation services.  Contacts at West Coast ports indicated that improved export traffic and holiday season importing kept several District seaports operating at capacity in December.  Demand for preventative and outpatient healthcare services continued to grow in the District.  Conditions in the District travel and tourism sector remained strong; several contacts noted a surge in travel associated with unusually good conditions in prominent ski areas.
