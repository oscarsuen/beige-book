Industrial output in the Eleventh District turned up in June after   trending down since last November, and a recent survey of the   largest manufacturers in the District indicates gains in output are   continuing. New orders have picked up this summer, and since   inventories of most finished goods are at low levels, this firming   in demand is translating into stepped-up production. For example,   output in the chemical industry, the District's largest, is on the   upswing. Chemical users, having worked off the high level of stocks   accumulated in the last half of 1974, are beginning to replenish   inventories, and production has now turned up after declining   sharply since last fall.
A big influx of orders has also prompted apparel and textile firms   to increase production schedules. Manufacturers claim inventories at   all levels of the garment industry—retailers, suppliers, and   distributors—are very low. As a result, one of the District's   largest garment makers said his goods are being shipped as soon as   they are produced.
Virtually all the manufacturers surveyed said that raw materials are   readily available, but input prices continue to climb. Because final   demand remains weak, prices of finished goods have held steady, and   in some cases have fallen. Profit margins, consequently are being   squeezed, and in some cases production costs are not being covered.   Producers of structural metals, for example, have been particularly   hard hit. A large manufacturer of reinforcing steel bars, reported a   20 percent increase in the cost of steel scrap—his principal input—this summer. Meanwhile, the market for construction remains weak   and, as a result, most shipments have been priced below production   costs.
Once demand firms, however, many manufacturers say they will try to   regain their traditional profit margins. Therefore, as economic   recovery gathers momentum, prices of manufactured goods are expected   to climb substantially.
Auto sales in the District have turned up sharply. New car   registrations in the four largest metropolitan counties of Texas   were 14 percent higher in June than in May. A survey of new car   dealers suggests July sales were even better. An upswing in consumer   confidence contributed to the upturn in sales, but dealers believe   the announcement of higher prices for next year's models was also a   major factor in spurring sales. Moreover, dealers say consumer   expectations of higher prices should keep demand for 1975 models   strong.
In anticipation of increased auto sales at the close of the current   model year, dealers have placed large orders to replenish their   inventories. But, largely because of plant closings, new cars have   been, and will likely remain, in short supply. As a result, dealers   claim a significant volume of sales is being lost. A Fort Worth   dealer, for example, says the maximum order Ford allowed him is well   below what demand warrants. This lack of inventory, he maintains, is   holding down sales at least a third.
District banks have increased their holdings of municipal securities   about 5 percent this year, or over four times the national average   for commercial banks. Net additions to municipal portfolios are   expected to continue, at least through the remainder of 1975, as the   New York City situation is having only a minimal impact on municipal   markets in the District. Although buyers have become more conscious   of the creditworthiness of issues, municipalities in the Southwest   are generally on sound financial footing. In fact, issues by   District cities are currently being oversubscribed.
Farm and ranch income in the District states has fallen sharply this   year. Cash receipts from sales of livestock and crops for the first   five months of 1975 were 19 percent less than for the corresponding   period last year, compared with a 9 percent decline for the nation.   But costs of producing food and fiber have continued to climb.
The resulting financial squeeze was reflected in a midyear survey of   agricultural credit conditions in the District. Repayments of   outstanding bank loans have been sluggish, and the number of   renewals and extensions of loans has risen substantially. As a   result, bankers are much more selective in their lending, and many   have increased collateral requirements on loans.
Narrow profit margins are making it increasingly difficult for   farmers and ranchers with limited equity to meet more stringent   credit requirements to finance this year's production. Consequently,   bankers report the turndown rate on new agricultural loans is up   significantly. Areas where cotton and cattle are the principal   agricultural enterprises have been the hardest hit, as evidenced by   the high number of referrals of loan applicants to nonbank credit   agencies. Moreover, many of these referrals have been to various   emergency programs of the Farmers Home Administration, reflecting   the severity of the cost-price squeeze facing producers.
