Views expressed by Second District directors, retailers, and other   business leaders who were contacted recently point to a further   slowing in business activity over the past month. Retail sales in   general have been sluggish, although strengthening somewhat   recently; inventories are at, or approaching, excessive levels; and   unemployment is on the rise. At the same time, there has been no   lessening of liquidity pressures.
Retail sales over the holiday season were on the weak side but in   many cases no worse than the relatively pessimistic expectations. A   survey of the seven leading New York City department stores by a   local newspaper revealed that, in dollar terms, December sales by   these stores within the City had been slightly below those of   December of 1973, implying a significant decline in physical volume.   Sales of major appliances and other durable goods in general were   particularly weak. Dollar sales at those stores' suburban branches,   however, were slightly above last year's. The president of a large   Rochester department store reported sales by his firm to be in line   with his expectations that they would run at about the same level as   a year ago in dollar terms. Similarly, a senior official of a large   department store chain reported that dollar sales at the firm's   western New York affiliates in November and December were about   equal to those of the year earlier period, but that physical volume   was about 4 percent lower than during November-December 1973.
The retail sales picture appears to have brightened somewhat in   recent weeks, however, in response to both pre-Christmas and the   usual post-holiday sales. Thus, the president of a nationwide retail   firm stated that business during most of the Christmas buying season   ran significantly below expectations, but that as a result of heavy   promotional activities the season had ended on a strong note, with   good traffic continuing after Christmas. A senior official of a   large New York City department store similarly reported that after a   slow start, business had been brisk in the final days of the holiday   season, a development also reported by several other retailers.   Among others, the president of another large New York department   store with branches in the suburbs stated that Christmas sales had   been up to his expectations and that so far his firm's January sales   had been "producing business" and were heavier than in January 1973.
In the view of several respondents, the reduction in consumer demand   and the accompanying more competitive selling practices have been   reflected in some evidence of downward pressures on prices of   finished goods. One retailer stated that price reductions for   various items were legion within the retail industry, generally due   to overproduction by manufacturers of dry goods, appliances and   similar items, and to the desire to reduce inventories. The   respondents, however, did not regard the decline in a number of raw   material prices as having as yet had a significant influence on the   price of finished goods.
Regarding inventory positions, the president of the nationwide   retail firm mentioned above reported that his firm had been   overstocked for several months and was making major efforts to get   its inventories into line with consumer demand. A senior official of   a multinational chemical concern stated that while inventories had   not yet built to excessive levels, he expected increases during the   first half of 1975. The chairman of a large New York City bank   looked for inventories to rise sharply in response to falling sales.   Several other respondents, however, felt that inventories remained   at an acceptable level.
The District unemployment situation deteriorated further during the   past month, particularly in the New York City area and in Buffalo.   The November jobless rate in New York State rose to 6.6 percent, and   to 7.4 percent in New York City. December figures are expected to   show a substantial further rise. There have been frequent reports of   layoffs by major firms in various parts of the District, and in   recent weeks new claims for unemployment insurance benefits in New   York State have been among the highest in the nation. However, the   majority of the respondents commenting on the subject as yet   discerned little or no easing of the shortage of skilled workers or   of highly qualified managerial employees. Some respondents, however,   did see, or expected to see shortly, some easing in the situation.
Regarding liquidity positions, none of the respondents reported any   signs of easing in pressures thus far. On the contrary, the majority   of the Buffalo directors felt that conditions were worsening.   Several of these directors noted that in view of the   unattractiveness of the bond and equity markets and the lack of   access to national money markets generally, many businesses in their   area were seeking commercial bank loans for working capital or to,   at least temporarily, finance capital expansion. Others cited the   substantial increase in delinquencies on accounts receivables, and   the increase in the number of bankruptcies.
