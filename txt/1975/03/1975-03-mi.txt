Recent evidence indicates further weakening in District business   activity. Unemployment rose sharply in January, and manufacturers   are not so optimistic as they were last November. Nevertheless, bank   directors cited several sectors where business activity has   improved. In addition, directors report that District businesses   have not been confronted with overly excessive inventories;   inflationary pressures have also eased. The District's rural areas   continue to be relatively unaffected by the recession.
Unemployment continues to rise. The District's unemployment rate,   seasonally adjusted, increased from 5.9 percent to 6.4 percent   between December and January, with the Minneapolis-St. Paul area   rate jumping from 5.1 percent to 6.2 percent. In early 1975,   District help-wanted advertising was down 30 percent from a year ago   and initial claims for unemployment insurance were up 35 percent.
District manufacturers are not so optimistic about their sales   outlook as they were last November. After increasing 15.9 percent   from a year earlier in the fourth quarter, District manufacturers   look for their sales to surpass year-ago levels by around 9 percent   during the first nine months of this year. (Last November   respondents had anticipated a 14 percent sales gain during the first   half of 1974.) Both durables and nondurables producers revised   downward their sales expectations, with price increases probably   accounting for most, if not all, of the anticipated sales gains.   Recent declines in District manufacturing employment also denote a   weakening in manufacturing activity. There are, however, some areas   of strength. Twin Cities producers of medical equipment and   peripheral electronic data processing equipment are enjoying strong   sales. Small local machine shops are also doing quite well from both   a volume and profit standpoint.
Although District business activity has continued to weaken, some   District industries have recently shown improvement. Several   directors commented that the automobile rebates have had a favorable   effect upon sales. The substantial inflows of savings to thrift   institutions have made more mortgage money available, and one large   Minneapolis-St. Paul area savings and loan association has begun to   advertise the availability of funds. In addition, the observation   was made that lower interest rates have benefited finance companies,   the securities industry, banks and utilities. A director associated   with the retail trade industry indicated that his firm's sales   improved in February but cautioned that it was too early to   ascertain whether a definite pickup in consumer spending has   occurred.
Directors from outside the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area   indicated that business has held up quite well in their areas. Two   directors from the Dakotas described business in that region as   normal for this time of year. A Montana director stated that his   area's businessmen are more optimistic than earlier this winter and   reported that his area's retail sales have held up quite well. A   director from the upper peninsula of Michigan, however, indicated   that business has been off in his area's copper and paper   industries.
Directors indicated that no excessive amount of unwanted inventory   accumulation has occurred in the District. Many local and regional   companies in the Twin Cities area are holding inventories above   desired levels. The situation, however, does not call for any forced   liquidation of inventories. Most managers are of the opinion that,   with a modest reduction in their rates of output, the desired level   and balance of inventories can be achieved by midyear or earlier.   Another report indicated that the inventory situation in the retail   trade industry has improved. Directors from outside the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area generally agreed that excess inventories   are not a problem. However, two directors reported a weakening in   farm machinery sales and a recent buildup in inventories. Also, the   District's livestock industry is burdened with an excessive supply   of cattle; one director felt that the District's livestock industry   would not recover until 1978.
Bank directors were unanimous in expressing the opinion that   inflationary pressures have or will be easing. One director, for   example, indicated that his firm's budgeted price increases for 1975   were only half as large as price increases experienced in 1974. Many   directors cited examples of price reductions in their area or   industry. One report indicated that list prices are not being cut   because of some fear that there will be a return of wage and price   controls. However, transaction prices are declining as businessmen   provide special incentives or volume discounts.
