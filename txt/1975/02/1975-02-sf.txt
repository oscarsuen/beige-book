In the opinion of our directors, there was a sharp deterioration in   the economic climate in January, after employment and income in this   region had held up relatively well through the end of 1974. Many of   the directors still expect a pick-up toward the end of this year.   The weakest sectors are housing, lumber and aerospace. The   agricultural sector is still strong, and retail sales are holding up   except for autos.
The directors feel that we are in for a period of belt-tightening   and emphasis is being placed on controlling costs and productivity   improvement programs. The consensus is that the recession will be   short but sharp. Material shortages have practically disappeared and   there is now fear of rapidly developing excess inventories. The rate   of inflation is expected to decline to 6 percent by year-end because   of excess supplies and low utilization rates.
In response to a question regarding the outlook for employment in   their own industries, no director anticipated increases. In Utah, a   very strong end 1974 showing was marred by the recent announcement   of layoffs at Kneecap Copper Corporation. About 1,200 employees are   involved and it has been estimated that each layoff would create a   further 2 1/2 percent unemployed in secondary industry. The Boeing   Company anticipates a decline of 1,500 employees, 2.5 percent of its   work force, in the first half of 1975 as a result of delays and   reductions in the level of commercial aircraft orders.
The agricultural sector, although generally strong, is beginning to   develop cracks. High costs have depressed the cattle-feeding   industry to the point where feed lots are being shut down and   bankruptcies are being reported. Producers claim that along with the   high feed costs they are suffering from political pressure and   consumer activism. On the other hand, grains and most other crops   continue to earn a good return and farmers are continuing efforts to   expand acreage. One exception is cotton where growers are feeling   the pinch of lower prices.
Our directors do not foresee any growth in nonresidential building   activity over the next 6 months. They believe that passage of the   investment tax credit would not translate to increased capital   expenditures until year-end. The Seattle area, however, expects   increased activity in the second half of 1975 due to such special   factors as the Alaskan pipeline and the Trident Missile Base   Development program. There appears to be some demand for small   industrial buildings. This is being handled by a new type of   financing in which developers are selling industrial condominiums.   In the current financial climate, this enables the smaller   businessman to put his financial package together.
Residential housing construction is still viewed as the disaster   area of the current recession and its impact on the lumber industry   in the Pacific Northwest is severe. Nevertheless, one director   reports that his lumber firm anticipates "full production again   within the next 6 months and heavy reemployment within the wood   products industry as a whole."
Retail sales declines so far appear to be concentrated on durable   goods. In Southern California retail sales of nondurables held up   well until just after Christmas, but have slowed considerably in   January. The rebates being offered on automobiles are helping the   small car lines, but are not stimulating sales of medium-priced   cars. Luxury automobile lines continue to sell well.
Among District states, the impact of the current recession is   varied. With its prosperous agricultural sector, Idaho is faring   better than the national average, and Utah is benefiting from strong   demand for coal and fertilizer products. The strongest areas of   California are those with an energy or agricultural base. The   slowdown in general business activity is most apparent in the   Pacific Northwest and Southern California, areas dependent on   lumber, electronics and aerospace.
