Reports continue to indicate a slowing in District economic   activity. Even though the District has so far avoided large layoffs,   labor market conditions have softened, and unemployment was expected   to rise. Economic developments have also made District consumers   hesitant to spend, and in January, many retailers had to cut prices   to stimulate sales. Rebates have helped to spur District auto sales,   and several directors felt tax rebates would help promote consumer   spending. In general, business activity has been somewhat better in   the District's rural areas than in the Minneapolis/St. Paul   metropolitan area. The District's farm economy, however, is not as   strong as a year ago. Bank directors cited several reasons for the   recent declines in grain and soybean prices.
Although the District has escaped large layoffs, labor market   conditions have undergone some softening. After the burst of layoffs   reported in January's Redbook, no significant layoffs have occurred   in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area. However, help wanted   advertising has fallen in the Twin Cities, and hiring has slowed.   The policy of Twin Cities area businessmen was described as running   a "tight ship" with a willingness to let work forces decline   gradually. Also some shrinkage in middle management employment has   occurred at some large firms which had laid off shop workers   earlier.
Outside of the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area, several   directors reported only seasonal unemployment increases. However, a   Western Montana director stated that a third of his state's workers   in the forest products industry were out of work. Layoffs have also   occurred in the forest products industry in the Upper Peninsula of   Michigan, but these employment declines are being offset by strength   in that area's mining industry. In general, bank directors were   looking for further weakening in District labor market conditions   and additional rises in unemployment.
District retail sales in January reflected the weakening in District   business activity. One director associated with the retail trade   industry termed consumer spending in January as "soft." Another   report indicated that Minneapolis/St. Paul area retailers have had   to engage in price cutting and sales promotions in order to attract   business. Promotions have helped to reduce inventories but have hurt   retailers' profits. Retail spending has held up somewhat better   outside of the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area. In the Upper   Peninsula of Michigan, for example, tourist spending was up in   January, and retail spending was quite good. Several other directors   from rural areas also indicated that consumer spending had held up   quite well in their areas. However, a Western Montana director   described January retail spending in his area as "sad." With regard   to the future, several directors indicated that a tax rebate would   help to stimulate retail spending.
Auto rebates have helped to offset recent declines in District   automobile sales. One major car manufacturer's sales in the   Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area during the last 2 weeks of   January were up 85 percent from those reported in the previous 2   weeks. In addition, several directors stated that the rebates have   stimulated auto sales in their areas. One interesting observation by   two directors was that the rebates have helped to promote the sales   of autos not eligible for rebates. Dealers in the Minneapolis/St.   Paul metropolitan area hope that the rebates will bring their car   inventories down to desired levels by the end of February. On the   negative side there is a feeling that many car buyers are customers   who would have bought in any case and are merely accelerating their   purchases to take advantage of the cash rebate.
Bankers responding to our latest agricultural credit conditions   survey reported that the District's farm economy was not as strong   as a year ago. Bankers reported that some customers may be getting "into difficulty," but there were no reports of widespread   bankruptcies. Many bankers stressed, though, that another year like   1974 could be disastrous. Although recent declines in grain and   soybean prices have helped, livestock producers are still in a cost-price squeeze. Also, the early January blizzard caused heavy   livestock losses in Minnesota and Eastern South Dakota. For many   farmers, however, sales of 1974 crops will help bolster farm   receipts in early 1975. Many bankers anticipate strong loan demand   in 1975 to help cover farm operating costs. But increased deposit   flow, primarily from crop sales, should provide the funds needed to   meet loan demand, at least through the first quarter. Conditions   will likely be tighter in the spring as seasonal borrowing needs   pick up.
Grain and soybean prices have declined markedly, and bank directors   cited several reasons for the falling prices. First, the   cancellation of Russian and Chinese orders have lessened export   demand for grain. Second, cattle feeders have cut back on their   demand for feed grains. A Montana director, for example, indicated   that many livestock producers are doing without feed grains. Third,   recent price declines were attributed to larger January 1, 1975   carryovers than anticipated by market participants. Finally, users   of grain products have reduced their buying in order to cut down   accumulated inventories. These price developments have brought some   relief to the District's livestock producing industry but imply some   income reduction for those farmers still holding 1974 crops.
