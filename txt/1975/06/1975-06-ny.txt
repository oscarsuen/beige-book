The overall picture that emerges from the views expressed by Second   District directors and other business leaders who were contacted   recently is one of a further moderation in the rate of the economic   decline, if not of an actual turnaround. Retail sales rose strongly   in May, further progress has been made toward reducing inventories,   and district crop prospects look good. The auto and construction   industries continue to display weakness, however, and the demand for   bank credit remains soft.
The retail sales picture brightened considerably over the past   month. According to a survey by a local newspaper, sales at major   New York City department stores, which had been running below last   year's levels during the first four months of this year, were nearly   4 percent higher this May than in May 1974, while retail sales for   the entire metropolitan area were 5.4 percent higher than a year   ago. According to an official of a trade association, New York City   area merchants have become markedly more optimistic. On the basis of   his contacts with local retail firms, he reported that, while the   May increase was in good part accounted for by increased apparel   sales, sales of major appliances and furniture had also increased.   He felt that the improved retail sales atmosphere was due largely to   a strengthening in consumer confidence, with the tax rebates playing   only a minor part. The president of a nationwide department store   chain felt that consumer purchases of durable goods would likely   increase as economic recovery takes hold, a sentiment shared by   other respondents. The Buffalo Branch directors reported strong   retail sales in western New York in May, in some areas as high as 15   percent above a year ago, and expressed optimism that consumer   spending would remain strong at least through early summer. The   respondents, however, were generally cautious regarding the near-term outlook for automobile sales. Several businessmen expressed the   view that auto sales might not improve significantly until the   introduction of the 1976 models. The president of a large steel firm   stated that he was cautious regarding auto sales, but he noted that   millions of autos continue to be scrapped yearly and that a "hidden" demand must be building up.
Regarding inventories, the retailers reported a substantial decline   from high levels at the turn of the year, although the president of   the department store chain mentioned above felt that durable goods   inventories remained high. The president of a steel corporation   reported that his firm was reducing its stocks on hand and that the   firm's customers have rapidly reduced their inventories, which   should be at "normal" levels by the beginning of July. The president   of a nonferrous metals producer, on the other hand, observed that,   despite inventory liquidation, stocks of metals other than steel   remain at high levels. Among senior officials in the chemicals   industry, several reported inventories under control, although one   felt that his firm's stocks were still too high.
Turning to agriculture, a Buffalo Branch director with farming   interests reported that spring weather conditions have been ideal   for crop planting. If the favorable weather conditions continue   through harvest time, the prospects are for very high yields in most   crops. The high yields are expected to result in lower prices in   general, except for certain vegetable crops where the carry-over   from last year was particularly low. Beef prices are expected to   remain strong, but lower prices are anticipated for eggs and poultry   products.
On the darker side, none of the respondents expressing views on the   subject were optimistic over the near-term outlook for the   construction industry. Among others, a senior official of a large   New York City area savings bank reported that, as a result of a   large inflow of deposits in recent months, his bank had much more   funds available for mortgages than there was demand for such funds,   and he did not expect a turnaround in construction activity for at   least four to five months. Some observers noted the recent tendency   of depositors to shun higher-yielding certificates of deposit in   favor of regular savings accounts, suggesting that they may be   building up liquidity for withdrawal in the near term. The Buffalo   Branch directors generally felt that the 5 percent tax credit and   the large inflow of savings deposits had not provided a stimulus to   residential construction sufficient to overcome the depressing   effects of the uncertainties arising from current economic   conditions and high construction costs. They expected a gradual   recovery in the housing sector but felt a quick return to the high   levels of 1972 and 1973 does not seem likely.
