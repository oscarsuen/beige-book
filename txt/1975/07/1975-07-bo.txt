The directors remain optimistic inasmuch as they sense a firm halt   to the economic slide coupled with the emergence of a modest   recovery. Their attitude has shifted from a defensive posture to a   guardedly aggressive outlook. Before, they talked of salvaging the   situation; now they discuss strategies for business advancement.   However, with an eye to recent experience, they are proceeding   conservatively; and, although they are hopeful about the future,   they stress that the recession has eroded conditions in New England   substantially. The May rate of unemployment in New England was 11.6   percent, an increase of .2 percentage points from April.   Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island report unemployment   rates of 9.8, 12.6, and 16.2 percent, respectively.
In various areas of the region, construction contractors have found   jobs; however, they remain concerned since they are committed for   less than one year typically. In residential construction, the   outlook remains bleak. Interest rates, attitudes, and incomes are   sufficiently depressing to forestall activity at this time. Banking   directors, in an attempt to remain flexible, would warmly entertain   short-term construction lending, but the directors are finding the   opportunities to be sparse.
A director close to the Boston job market reports that firms are   showing renewed interest in hiring personnel. However, only   individuals with business or technical skills are required. While   selected professionals face improved employment conditions, the rank   and file suffer an extremely soft job market showing no signs of   improvement presently.
Matching the employment situation, high-priced real estate is   showing renewed life while inventories of medium-to-low-priced   housing remain substantial.
Retailing in Boston continues well. One director who had planned   June to be 5 percent over last year achieved sales increases of 10   percent. May and June have been two good months for soft goods; and,   although weather is given a good deal of credit, "the presence of   more money in the pocket is evident." The retailer notes that hard   goods lines remain weak but improving. He partially attributes the   success of soft goods to a reduced consumption of durables. The   director is not increasing fall buying or reviewing his plan of 5   percent. He is not betting on a rapid recovery.
This director also reports that manufacturers' inventories are very   low in his lines. However, the manufacturers are content to remain   leaner and tighter, for they too are cautious. Prices are firm; no   boom is encouraging markups, and rashes of panic sales have waned. A   surge in retail sales would elicit a direct response in production   activity.
Carbon black sales have changed little recently. As a result of   sluggish conditions, a price war has broken out. Owing to high   capital costs, some suppliers are attempting to improve market share   enough to increase capacity utilization and profits. Sales of   silicon pigments, used widely in the economy, are beginning to close   upon records set in 1974. Super alloy metal sales, on the other   hand, are continuing to weaken to the concern of our reporting   director.
Banking directors report healthy deposit performance. Both demand   and time deposits are increasing sufficiently fast to warrant a   reduced reliance on borrowed funds and large certificates of   deposit. Business loan portfolios remain weak, and consumer credit   shows little life as well. Interest rates are moving according to   expectations. Short-term rates are expected to change little from   current levels over the summer, but in the fall they are budgeted to   rise. The prime rate may break 8 percent by December.
Of our academic correspondents, only Professor Samuelson was   available for comment this month. He continues to believe that that   economy has probably begun a recovery, but he stresses that there is "not a momentous V bottom" in his outlook. Small increases in short-term interest rates are appropriate as the economy regains its   course. In his assessment, recovery will not be aborted if we allow   interest rates to develop their own momentum to a degree; however,   should they reach 10 percent, we may want to be more expansionary.   Samuelson has noted that most models now tell us that the path of   prices is largely independent of real growth. He feels that there is   a "germ of truth" to this, and accordingly he would like to see   money growth of 7.5 percent if we must observe the 5-7.5 percent   target. Since the target covers a 12-month horizon, he sees no   reason to engage quick corrections for the recent overshoot. The   recovery requires attention if we are to avoid disappointment.
