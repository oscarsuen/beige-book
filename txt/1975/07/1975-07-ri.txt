Judging from our June survey of District business conditions and   from other available information, there appears little doubt that   recovery is getting under way in the Fifth District. Survey   responses of manufacturers indicate increases in shipments, new   orders, employment, and hours worked per week, with backlogs of   orders unchanged and inventories continuing to decline. Both   manufacturers and retailers continue to express cautious optimism   about the outlook for the remainder of the year although responses   suggest lingering doubt about the vigor of the recovery. Overly   conservative inventory policies and the high cost of financing are   seen as possible impediments to a full recovery any time soon. The   Fifth District banking situation continues to reflect a relatively   low level of real economic activity and a cautious posture on the   part of business borrowers as well as banks. Loans outstanding in   most categories at weekly reporting banks declined in June, while   investments increased and the liability mix moved in favor of time   deposits.
The June survey of Fifth District business conditions indicates   continued improvement in most areas of business activity. More than   40 percent of the manufacturing respondents reported increases in   shipments and in the volume of new orders. Backlogs of orders were   essentially unchanged after declining for over a year. Almost 43   percent of the manufacturing respondents feel current inventory   levels remain excessive, although their responses suggest a further   substantial decline in stocks of both materials and finished goods   in June. On the employment front, 38 percent of the respondents   report an increase in the number of employees while only 12 percent   report a decrease. This tends to bear out an increasing number of   informal reports of rising employment and declining unemployment   across the District and represents a significant change from recent   months. Hours worked per week also increased in June according to   our survey, but some industries are still on short time.
Responses of manufacturers also suggest continuing upward pressures   on prices. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents reported paying   and receiving higher prices, with the same percentage indicating   increases in average hourly compensation of employees. Current plant   and equipment capacity remains above desired levels, but there is no   indication of any desire to alter current expansion plans. Over half   the manufacturers surveyed now expect production in their own firms   to improve over the next six months. A majority also foresee   improvement in business conditions locally and nationally over that   time period.
Reports from the textile industry indicate that business is   beginning to pick up as retailers have achieved manageable inventory   levels and are resuming purchasing activity. Some textile   manufacturers are becoming more aggressive in the production and   marketing of new lines of merchandise. Others, however, express some   concern over the reluctance of retailers to commit themselves to   larger inventory positions. They believe that a continuation of   policies for maintaining lean retail inventories may lead to some   loss of sales at the retail level and retard recovery in the   manufacturing sector. In any case, it seems likely that some   hesitate to make the first move in stepping up production without a   commitment by retailers.
Meanwhile, our survey of District retailers shows sales   strengthening in June for the second consecutive month, although the   sale of big-ticket items relative to total sales remains weak.   Inventories at the retail level declined somewhat, and those   retailers surveyed feel current inventory levels are about right.   Prices, for the most part, were unchanged during June, and increases   in employee compensation were less widespread than in recent months.   Respondents to the retail survey were unanimous in expecting   conditions to improve over the next six months.
The consensus among District bankers is that the economy has   bottomed out but that recovery will take place only very slowly.   Commercial and industrial loans at weekly reporting banks in June   were nearly 6 percent below last year's level; but lending officers   believe that the decline has about ended, and some expect   improvement in the months ahead. One bank specified textile industry   term loan demand as an area of improvement. Several banks report   that utilization rates on loan commitments are at the lowest levels   of the last several years but that requests for new and increased   lines of credit are fairly strong. Some problem construction loans   still exist and are being worked out. Bankers express a hope that   increased recreational activity will facilitate residential sales at   projects that have suffered in resort areas.
Total demand deposits at weekly reporting banks were 1.8 percent   higher than a year earlier, while savings deposits were 15.5 percent   higher with strong inflows continuing. CD's outstanding declined 2.3   percent from May, and net Federal funds purchases of District member   banks during the first three weeks of June reached their lowest   level since April 1973. Borrowings at the discount window increased   somewhat in June, especially at month's end, but are still at an   extremely low level by historical standards.
Farmland values rose at a significantly slower pace during the year   ended March 1, 1975, than in other recent years. District-wide,   average farm real estate values per acre advance 11 percent, but the   increase compared with gains of 26 percent in 1974 and 16 percent in   1973.
Farmers' cash income from farm marketings continues to run well   below a year ago, although the 11-percent District decline from the   January-April period is much smaller than that nationally. But this   situation may well change. Eastern North Carolina's tobacco, corn,   and soybean crops have been hard hit by drought conditions.
