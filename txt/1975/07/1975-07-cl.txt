The pace of economic activity in some sectors of the District is   continuing to improve, particularly retail sales of nondurable   goods, housing, and several manufacturing industries. Employment and   production are still sluggish in a number of areas of the industrial   sector, however. Some manufacturing firms have been liquidating   inventories at a rapid pace and plan to continue their inventory   reduction programs in the near future. Capital spending, in real   terms, is not expected to recover until next year.
A major retail chain in the District reported unit sales of   nondurable goods picked up strongly during the past two months.   Strengthening of hard goods sales is expected later in the year. The   firm's buyers note prices for fall and winter merchandise have   declined. Price markdowns on apparel and white goods will be less   extensive than in recent months because inventories have been cut to   desired levels.
The latest report of Cleveland purchasing agents suggests that   production and new orders continued to decline in June at about the   same pace as in May. Inventory liquidation accelerated last month,   and employment and prices continued to decline. Those developments   are consistent with early returns from our June survey of District   manufacturers, except that our survey shows an increase in new   orders last month, the first gain since last August.
A large producer of consumer packaging materials said orders have   improved in recent months. The firm's inventories rose through   April, and it plans to liquidate excess stocks until year-end. An   appliance industry supplier views its inventories of finished and   semi-finished goods as slightly above desired levels. A major   chemical firm reports its stocks of chemical products in balance   with sales, but plastics inventories are still high.
A tire industry source said tire shipments to wholesalers and   retailers have recovered strongly. No further inventory liquidation   or price-cutting at the retail level is expected because dealer   inventories are low. (Shortly after reporting this item to us, the   tire firm announced a price increase averaging 5 percent on its   tires and tire products.) Tire producers plan to reduce inventories   for the remainder of the year by allowing tire production to   increase at a slower rate than sales.
In the capital goods sector, economists from several machinery   companies said they do not foresee a recovery in real capital   spending until early 1976. One economist said cancellations of   machine tool orders appear to have run their course. New orders   received by his firm were level in June, following some improvement   in May. Another large machinery company has laid off workers at   three plastics machinery plants in Ohio. New orders for certain   types of gears have softened recently, according to a director in   the capital goods business: On the positive side, a major steel firm   reported it will spend $20 million for new plant and equipment in   one of the District's most obsolete steel producing areas. A   director in the office equipment business said sales turned up   sharply last month.
A supplier to the truck industry said he foresaw no prospect for   recovery this year in the depressed market for heavy-duty trucks.   Inventories are very high. Sales of off-road heavy trucks used in   oil-drilling areas have picked up slightly, and the firm expects   more sales if oil prices are deregulated. The medium-sized truck   market is improving; light trucks are recovering significantly,   partly reflecting strength in demand for vehicles used on the farm   and for recreation.
Steel industry sources said the decline in new orders has leveled   off during the past few months. However, recovery in steel output is   not expected until the fourth quarter. An economist with a major   steel company commented on the nationwide increase in May's new   orders for durable goods, which is largely attributable to a rise in   steel orders. Steel orders received in May, seasonally adjusted, may   be overstated because delivery is usually during the low shipping   month of July. Thus, May's increase in durable goods orders may be   more a reflection of inadequacies in the seasonal adjustment process   than changes in underlying market condition. Steel producers have   been offering price concessions to stimulate demand. Steel service   centers, which have far more inventory than needed to handle current   orders have also cut some prices. Inventories at steel mills are   near desired levels, but warehouses and steel users are expected to   continue cutting inventories into the fourth quarter.
Executives from several oil companies based in the District reported   the nation's gasoline inventories are tight. They commented that   spot shortages could develop in the months ahead, particularly on   the East coast. Right now, oil refineries are maximizing gasoline   production and are raising prices to recover some past cost   increases. The major concern about the availability of petroleum   products is during the fall and winter. If the expected shortages of   natural gas occur, cutbacks of natural gas to industrial users will   force some companies to convert to fuel oil. This could cause   serious disruptions of petroleum product supplies. (As an indication   of impending natural gas shortages, a gas company recently announced   that it will cut off all natural gas to industries in Central   Kentucky effective November 1.)
In the housing market, residential construction contracts continued   to recover in May. The economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of   Cincinnati said preliminary data from their sample of savings and   loans indicate near-record deposit inflows during June. Loan   commitments have been rising, but a few savings and loans are still   cautious in their lending policies because of low liquidity and the   possibility of savings outflows later this year.
Several banks in the Fourth District have reported weak growth of   total demand deposits, which is a normal seasonal development in   this District.  Rapid increases in individual demand deposits have   been offset by declines in public deposits.
