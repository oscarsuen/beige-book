Despite a boom in output of oil field equipment and related   products, industrial production in the Eleventh District has   continued to decline at a moderate pace. In anticipation of the   dollar-a-barrel tariff imposed February 1, imports of crude oil were   accelerated in January. But, due to unseasonably mild weather and   the recession, demand for petroleum products has fallen and refiners   have trimmed operations. Petroleum refining is running at 84 percent   of capacity, down 10 percentage points since early January. In spite   of lower output, refiners report that stocks of finished products   are pressing storage capacities.
Chemical production has also trended downward since late last year   with a sharp falloff in new orders. Manufacturers attribute the drop   in bookings to inventory liquidation by many customers that made   large purchases last year as a hedge against possible shortages. One   of the District's leading producers of industrial chemicals reports   output has dropped to 50 percent of capacity. Despite reduced   demand, producers have been reluctant to lower prices. One firm   attributes the reluctance to an industry-wide concern that price   controls may be imposed later this year.
Operations of District steel producers primarily engaged in   supplying residential and commercial construction, continue to be   depressed. Manufacturers of reinforcing steel bars have cut   production as much as half. Still, a buildup of inventories has   forced them to substantially reduce prices. One of the largest   producers of re-bars, for example, has lowered prices by roughly 20   percent across the board and still reports record high inventories.
In addition, the falloff in demand has left many steel dealers flush   with high priced foreign steel that was ordered last year when   domestic mills could not keep pace with demand. During the fourth   quarter of 1974, foreign steel—priced well above domestic levels—poured into the District at record rates. Now, with prices down,   dealers will have to take losses estimated at $150 per ton to   liquidate their inventories. Nevertheless, foreign producers have   remained active in District markets by aggressively cutting prices.   Steel ordered in March, scheduled to reach the Gulf Coast this   summer, is priced roughly a tenth below quotes by District mills.   One official reports his firm cannot compete at current prices,   since quotes on foreign products are now lower than his cost of   production.
Manufacturers of truck trailers are experiencing drastic reductions   in new orders and production. To avoid the added cost of an anti-skid braking system that became mandatory on January 1, major fleets   bought ahead last year. As a result, new orders have been "practically nonexistent" this year. Production by one of the   largest manufacturers in the District is down 75 percent from the   level in the fourth quarter of 1974. And at one assembly plant where   400 workers have been laid off since mid-December, output has been   cut from 35 to 8 units per day. In addition, the slowdown in   business activity late last year prompted a sharp decline in hauling   and forced the cancellation of many orders. This has contributed to   large inventories of finished trailers—in the case of one firm   between 700 and 800 units.
Apparel manufacturers—many operating on reduced workweeks—report   orders have picked up recently. One major garment maker said   salesmen are now getting orders they would not have gotten a few   weeks ago, indicating that most retailers have run off large post-  Christmas inventories. Nevertheless, buyers remain extremely   cautious. To control inventories, retailers are ordering smaller   quantities and are reordering more frequently. In addition, they are   largely confining their purchases to staple items—basic styles,   sizes, and colors—and are carefully avoiding "fad" items.
Producers of oil field equipment—including offshore drilling   platforms—continue to operate under a deluge of orders. Backlogs of   three to five years are common. In addition, firms engaged in   supplying steel and fabricated metal products to equipment   manufacturers are hard pressed to meet demand. One of the District's   largest materials suppliers, for example, reports a two year backlog   of unfilled orders for steel castings. Shortages of skilled labor   are also impeding equipment production. Many firms have started   recruiting nationwide, especially in the Detroit area. Moreover,   several large producers have established schools to train unskilled   workers for skilled positions.
A survey of new car dealers indicated sales have fallen sharply   since the cash rebate program ended. Respondents said sales in March   were, on average, down 50 percent from the level in February.   Dealers admit the downturn seems to indicate that the cash rebates   simply borrowed from future sales. Nevertheless, they regard the   program as having been successful, as they were able to liquidate   large inventories of new cars—even to the extent of selling entire   stocks of some small models. Since dealers expected sales to be   sluggish after rebates ended, they have held down new orders, thus   keeping inventories manageable.
