Although general business activity continues to decline in the   Seventh District, there are signs that the rate of decline is   slowing. Job and product markets are much more competitive and   prices of various industrial products have declined. A heavy   snowfall on April 2 disrupted transportation and output in Chicago   and southern Michigan for a day or so. Output schedules for autos,   appliances, and some other consumer goods have been raised   moderately and tentatively from very depressed levels, mainly   because rapid inventory liquidations resulted in stockouts of   certain products. Weakness in capital goods is spreading. The farm   sector remains relatively strong. Residential construction appears   to be heading for a modest revival. Most analysts project some   growth in real GNP in the third quarter, helped by slower inflation,   inventory reductions, and more stimulative monetary and fiscal   policy. Most "monetarists," however, see "the turn" delayed for at   least one or two additional quarters. Many businessmen and lenders   are concerned that steps to bolster activity will accelerate the   inflation rate later this year or next year.
Output of autos, trucks, appliances (both large and small), and some   materials and components is scheduled to rise moderately in the next   month or two, less because of stronger demand than because of   inventory reductions that left some gaps. Producers of certain   products, for example, fasteners, small metal parts, and certain   home furnishing materials, report very spotty demand with   improvement in some areas, while others are severely depressed.   Demand for some construction equipment associated with home   building, very weak last year, has increased in some cases.
Despite scattered improvements, virtually all industries are   operating at reduced levels, most far below capacity, with no sign   of an early reversal. Steel mills, which continued to operate at   effective capacity throughout 1974, began to cut workweeks and lay   off workers in March.
Last year's severe shortages are only a fading memory except for   natural gas, fertilizer, and a few special items, mainly components   for heavy capital equipment. Lead times have been reduced sharply,   deliveries are more dependable, and complaints of poor quality are   less frequent. Products such as metal fasteners, paper, motors, and   electronic components, which often sold at premiums last year, are   now discounted—heavily in some cases. Certain bolts that brought   $35 per thousand last summer are now readily available at $8.50.   Market prices of some electronic components were cut in half in the   first quarter.
Much price cutting takes the form of negotiated discounts or changes   in terms of trade, with list prices unchanged. Such adjustments are   said to be more prevalent than in the past because of fears that   price controls will be reinstated. Manufacturers and large retailers   are "putting a squeeze" on suppliers. Price escalators have largely   disappeared and prices for future delivery are being quoted on a   firm basis for longer periods. However, in many sectors higher   prices are likely to hold. Prices of many types of components and   finished equipment are 15 to 25 percent or more higher than a year   ago. An insurance company reports that its price index on auto parts   is up 40 percent from a year ago.
Strength in capital goods, which sustained many District centers   through 1974, is ebbing rapidly. Demand for equipment for mining,   off-shore drilling, petro-chemicals, and pollution control is still   very strong. Markets for farm equipment will be more competitive   because producers are rapidly rebuilding badly depleted inventories.   Output of railroad equipment continues at a high level, but many   freight cars are in storage. Only open hopper cars are now in short   supply. Builders of large vessels for the Great Lakes, although   operating at high rates, say order backlogs are disappearing. Oil   companies say that the end of depletion and changes in tax treatment   of foreign earnings will reduce exploration budgets. Producers of   various capital goods report cancellations of orders as well as   postponements and stretchouts. Reduced demand for products and   reduced cash flow are cited as reasons. A producer of construction   and materials handling equipment says, however, that the "explosive" rate of order cancellations that started late last year has   moderated. Producers of components for equipment report that the   decline in orders, very sharp in late 1974 and early 1975, has   leveled off—even reversed in some cases. A number of companies say   that European orders have held up better than domestic business.   Some believe that the dollar is now substantially undervalued   relative to various other currencies. There is no evidence that the   increase in the investment tax credit (to 10 percent) has affected   sales of equipment.
The decline in employment and the rise of unemployment continues in   most centers, but probably at a slower pace. Factory work layoffs   continue and many companies are trimming office workers and   executives—often by forcing early retirement. Total employment is   not being sustained, as in the past, by the service sectors. Many   utilities are reducing staff, and jobs in finance and retail trade   are not expanding significantly. The City of Detroit has announced a   25 percent staff reduction to help balance its fiscal 1976 budget.
Large general merchandisers, other than "discounters," were   disappointed with March sales—far below last year after adjustment   for inflation. The early Easter clearly didn't help. Retailers'   inventories are reported to be in good shape after reductions   starting in late 1974.
Although construction contracts and building permits in the District   remained at very low levels through February, there are reports that   improved availability of credit is beginning to activate   transactions. Savings inflows at S&Ls have been very favorable.   These institutions have been able to repay debt and are actively   seeking mortgages. Developers of various residential and commercial   projects are coming out of hibernation after 6-8 months. Rapid   release of impounded water and sewer funds would help construction   activity.
