The district economy expanded modestly in March and early April.  Retail sales were again outstanding, with vehicle sales rebounding nicely from slower activity earlier in the year. Construction activity remained strong, and energy activity may be poised for a turnaround following the recent jump in oil prices.  Manufacturing activity held steady, although at a relatively weak level when compared with a year ago.  In the farm economy, the winter wheat crop remained in good condition and growing conditions continue to be generally favorable.  Labor markets in most of the district remained very tight, with wage pressures continuing to mount.  Retail prices edged up, as did prices for some construction materials, while prices for several manufacturing materials fell as factories took advantage of cheap imports.
