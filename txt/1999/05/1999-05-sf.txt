Reports from contacts indicate robust economic activity in the Twelfth District in recent weeks, despite continued restraint from weak trade conditions.  Sales were strong for retailers and providers of services to businesses and consumers.  Respondents noted vigorous activity and further expansion in housing and real estate markets in most areas of the District.  Demand for bank credit was strong.  Manufacturers and agricultural producers were hampered by international trade conditions; performance in these sectors changed little compared to recent survey periods, although a slight improvement was noted in agriculture.  Price increases were limited overall, despite a sharp increase in the price of gasoline and rising prices for some services.
District service providers have been operating at capacity.  In California, strong demand for business and transportation services kept those sectors bustling.  Demand for telecommunications services was strong and grew further throughout the District.  Several respondents reported a pickup in merchandise exports to East Asia, which has been reflected in reduced outflow of empty containers from West Coast ports.  Although prices for most services reportedly remained stable, respondents noted increases in health insurance premiums and in the prices of hotel rooms and airline tickets.
