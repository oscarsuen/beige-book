Business conditions remain strong.  Tight labor markets in most parts of the District are affecting many firms' plans for expansion or relocation.  Wage pressures, however, remain subdued, and materials costs, except those affected by the recent surge in oil prices, have shown little upward movement.  Housing markets are vibrant with the spring home buying season in full swing.  Contacts see a shortage of warehouse space, especially in southern parts of the District.  Loans outstanding fell at large District banks over the past two months because of a sharp drop in real estate loans during that period.  With the planting of spring crops under way, moisture conditions in most states are generally adequate or in surplus.  Planting progress is still on schedule.
Outside of energy-related items, there appears to be only moderate, if any, pressure on the prices of goods and services, while materials costs are flat or falling.  For example, an insurer in the commercial and passenger automobile market reports difficulty in passing along cost increases as higher premiums.  The printing industry sees prices and costs remaining stable this year.  Contacts in the poultry processing industry report that lower feed prices are enabling them  to add breeder capacity.  A St. Louis-based metal fabricator noted considerable downward pressure on the prices of its manufactured products.
The spring home buying season is now in full swing:  The average number of days a house is on the market has plummeted, and sale prices have begun to rise.  Many real estate agents are calling this a seller's market, with some houses selling the day they are listed.  In western Tennessee, on the other hand, an excess supply of starter homes (less than $100,000) is reportedly available.
Commercial real estate agents continue to see excesses in the market, particularly of office and industrial space.  Warehouse and distribution space, though, is extremely scarce in some areas.
