District reports indicate that the U.S. economy continues to operate at generally strong levels and to expand at a moderate pace.  Consumer spending remains healthy, led by strong motor vehicle sales.  Most Districts noted improvements in manufacturing activity; however, weak foreign demand is a problem for some industries in some regions.  Both residential and commercial construction remain at high levels, although some slowing in the rate of expansion was noted in several Districts. Reports on agriculture have been mixed, while the outlook in the energy sector has improved.  Loan demand is generally described as strong in many areas of the country.  Most Districts continue to report tight labor markets, but these conditions are apparently not often translating into higher wages; however, there are reports that non-wage compensation is increasing.  Prices generally remain stable, with the exception of oil and gas, and some building materials, which are in short supply.
Motor vehicle sales grew at a healthy pace in most Districts in March and early April.  Sales were strong in the Richmond, Kansas City, Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts.  In the Philadelphia District, sales of sports cars and luxury models increased, while sales of trucks and sports-utility vehicles held steady, demand was particularly strong for sports-utility vehicles in Dallas.  Chicago reports that new and used light vehicle sales were robust.  After a strong first quarter, some Cleveland dealers report a slowdown in early April.
Overall, home sales continue at healthy levels and demand remains strong.  In the Chicago District, existing home sales remained brisk in most areas, exceeding expectations.  Home sales have strengthened since February in the Kansas City region, while Realtors in the Richmond District report significant increases in home sales.  Many areas of the St. Louis region are being referred to as a "sellers market," and the New York housing market is described as "tight."  Boston markets are characterized by strong demand and improving sales.  Most Realtors in the Atlanta District said that home sales were mixed in March and flat in early April.
Commercial construction continued at strong levels in most Districts, although there were a few reports of slowing activity.  In the Atlanta District, continuing high levels of commercial building fell somewhat below the year-ago level.  Construction is described as strong in the Chicago District and continues at a brisk pace in the San Francisco District.  Occupancy rates stabilized during the first quarter in New York, while leasing costs escalated.  Construction is running ahead of last year's levels in the Minneapolis region, while development was recently mixed in markets in the Cleveland District.
Credit quality was little changed overall.  In New York there was some tightening of standards for commercial loans, and delinquency rates fell on consumer loans.  The quality of business and consumer loans was good, and consumer delinquencies were down in Chicago.  There have been no changes in credit quality, and consumer and commercial delinquencies remain low in Cleveland, and little change in credit standards in the Richmond region.  Intense competition may have led to some relaxation in terms and covenants in the commercial sector in Atlanta.
The energy sector is stabilizing.  Natural gas exploration has picked up recently, but oil exploration still remains weak in the Minneapolis District.  In the Dallas District, drilling has not increased in response to higher oil and natural gas prices.  After declining in March, the rig count in the Kansas City District began to edge up during the first few weeks in April, and Atlanta reports that rising oil and gas prices have improved the outlook for Louisiana companies linked to the oil and gas industry.
Most prices remain stable.  Building materials prices, especially for sheetrock, are increasing in the Atlanta, Kansas City, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Boston regions.  Contracted services costs have increased in New York.  Low commodity prices in Minneapolis persist in depressing farm income and are curbing metal mining.
