The Fifth District economy advanced at a quicker pace in the weeks since our last report.  Retailers reported bustling sales--especially of big-ticket items--and services-sector activity rebounded from several months of sluggishness.  Manufacturing continued to strengthen; both shipments and new orders rose sharply in recent weeks.  In real estate markets, the pace of development and sales remained rapid, and financial institutions across the District reported generally strong lending activity.  Labor markets tightened further but, outside of manufacturing, wages and prices increased only moderately in most sectors.  In agriculture, farmers made good progress with their spring planting, but crop prices remained low.
Commercial real estate activity remained at a high level in most areas, although there were fewer signs of an overheated market.  A Richmond, Va., realtor indicated that things have remained "fairly quiet" while several realtors in the northern Virginia area indicated that class A office space is generally more available.  Retail leasing activity picked up in North Carolina; a Raleigh, N.C., realtor described the restaurant business there as "getting out of hand."  In contrast, a developer in Charlotte, N.C., expressed concern about possible office market overbuilding in that area.
