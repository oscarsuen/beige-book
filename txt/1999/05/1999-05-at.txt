The Southeast economy continues to grow moderately, but contacts' outlooks have become less upbeat since our last report.  April retail sales were weaker than a month earlier, partly because of an early Easter that shifted many purchases into March.  Recent reports on the tourism and hospitality sector have been very positive, but contacts in Florida have become more concerned about the international portion of the state's tourism sector over the next several months.  Builders report single-family construction is still growing slowly, and non-residential construction declined somewhat in the first quarter.  Bankers report continued strong loan demand, and firms indicate that funds are available.  Factory production has increased slightly since our last report, but manufacturers' outlooks are less optimistic than before.  Tight labor markets remain a problem for District firms, but significant wage increases are largely limited to skilled labor.  Contacts generally anticipate few price changes over the next several months.
The pace of commercial construction in the District declined slightly during the first quarter compared with last year.  Office, industrial, and retail markets in the region generally remain balanced.  Office and industrial vacancy rates have risen somewhat in several key markets, but the increase has been subdued.
Prices are not expected to change much over the near term, with a few exceptions.  Several companies are pressuring suppliers to keep prices stable and continue to squeeze margins to remain competitive.  Building material prices, however, are increasing, partly because of strong residential construction markets and to a shortage of drywall.  As before, reports indicate rising health insurance premiums.
