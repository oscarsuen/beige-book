Economic conditions in the Seventh District remained strong in March and April, similar to our last report.  Retailers continued to reap the benefits of confident consumers and strong home sales.  Overall construction activity appeared to gain momentum in spite of shortages of skilled labor and some building supplies.  Again, manufacturing activity was strong, but mixed, as some of the region's mainstay industries continued to struggle.  Lending activity was brisk as demand for both business and consumer loans remained high.  Concerns over labor shortages became more pronounced and there were a few new reports of intensifying wage pressures.  Low commodity prices continued to plague farmers and a majority of the District's agricultural lenders reported slower farm loan repayments than a year ago.
