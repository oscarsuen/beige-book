The pace of District nonresidential construction is slightly ahead of a year ago but varied across the different states in the District.  Contacts in Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee report that construction continues to slow but remains above year-ago levels.  In Louisiana, construction activity is similar to last year's level, while in Alabama and Mississippi construction continues at below year-ago levels.  Vacancy rates are on the rise in the Atlanta office and industrial markets as well as the Orlando office market.
Contacts expect no significant changes in the prices of inputs or outputs for the near term with only a few exceptions.  Health insurance premiums and pharmaceuticals prices are expected to continue on an upward trend.  Some contacts say that the cost of higher oil prices is cutting into profits more than impacting the pricing of goods and services because of the competitive marketplace.  An "abundance of work" is keeping construction materials prices high in parts of the District.
