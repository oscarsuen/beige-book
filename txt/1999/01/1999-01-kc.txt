The district economy grew moderately again last month, although widespread signs of easing remain.  Holiday retail sales were very brisk and somewhat higher than expected.  Construction activity also remained strong.  But manufacturing activity in the district declined again and the energy sector weakened from an already depressed position due to another fall in energy prices.  In the farm economy, recent government payments to grain producers generated some recovery in overall farm income, but district hog producers continued to have difficulties due to record-low prices.  Labor markets remained very tight in most of the district, but wage pressures subsided somewhat from recent surveys, especially in the retail sector.  Prices remained flat at the retail level and mixed for construction materials, while prices for steel and other manufacturing materials continued to decline.
