Economic growth in the District continues at a moderate pace, despite less-than-glowing reports from retailers.  District retailers remain optimistic, however, about sales prospects in the first half of 1999.  Other business contacts saw relatively healthy conditions, with some reporting an unexpected growth in sales because of unusually warm weather.  Labor markets remain tight, and worker "poaching" is on the rise again in certain areas.  Residential real estate markets remain strong, with a lengthy backlog in some regions.  Loan demand at large District banks remains strong, especially on the business side.  Despite the recent cold snap, the District's winter wheat crop appears to be in good condition.
District car dealers reported that December sales were up on average about 6 percent from a year earlier.  Most dealers noted that current inventories were not at desirable levels:  some too high; many others too low. Contacts also indicated that buyers have recently substituted purchases of new cars for used cars; used car sales have slowed as a result.  Overall, dealers are optimistic about 1999, anticipating sales to remain on their current track through the second quarter.
Labor markets remain tight in most parts of the District.  In the Evansville area, for example, the Toyota plant is said to be exhausting the available workforce, and smaller businesses are unable to compete with Toyota's compensation packages.  In other areas, contacts have noticed an increase in employee poaching.  Despite tight labor markets, though, parts of the District, especially the Louisville and Memphis areas, are increasing their large importance as distribution centers.  Many incoming firms cite the region's central location and the presence of UPS and FedEx hubs.
Shifting demand has also affected employment at some District firms.  After many years of operating an intense production schedule to meet the demand for minivans, DaimlerChrysler has laid off about 500 workers at its St. Louis plant because of reduced sales.  Other firms are reporting employee cutbacks because of slack Asian demand.  There are also reports that weakened Asian demand is leading to a pileup of empty cargo containers at regional ports.
Despite the recent financial problems in much of the Farm Belt, credit availability does not appear to have been restricted for most farmers.  There are some reports, though, of a small number of farmers selling tangible assets to raise needed funds.   Continued low crude oil prices have led several producers to shut down a large number of low-volume stripper wells, which, accordingly, has adversely affected the demand for oil field services in a number of areas.
