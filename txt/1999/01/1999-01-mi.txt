As 1999 begins, the economy of the Ninth District is strong.  This is reflected in business leader sentiment, which remains optimistic overall despite a few signs of caution.  Construction, which is an economic locomotive with a full head of steam barreling through one record after another, is further evidence of overall optimism. Consumer spending continues very strong, as do most manufacturing operations. Labor markets remain tight and employment high.  There are few signs, if any, of higher prices.  On the negative side, the primary commodity sectors including agriculture, oil, mining and paper continue under financial pressure.
Despite very active nonresidential building over several years, vacancy rates for Minneapolis-St. Paul office and retail space fell to their lowest levels thus far in the 1990s.  Industrial vacancy rates also fell and are below most of the decade but still slightly above a low set in 1996.  And a construction sector publication's annual survey of architects and engineers in Minnesota and the Dakotas revealed that most expected their design loads to increase or stay the same through 1999.
Little change is seen from late 1998 patterns in vehicle sales.  Sport utility vehicles and light trucks are selling well, traditional sedans less so.  Sales are strong in urban areas, but weaker in regions where agriculture predominates.  Several sources noted that foreign cars were selling better than domestics.  "I could have sold more if I could have gotten the product," says one Montana dealer.
Lack of snow delayed the winter tourism season in most district states, but the impact varied with location, according to tourism officials.  They report improvement since snow fell in late December.  One official in Michigan's Upper Peninsula reports that while the ski and snowmobile season started late, inquiries to the office were up 200 percent after snow started falling.  In northern Wisconsin, traffic through tourism areas is reportedly lighter than usual.  Skiing and  snowmobiling started six weeks late in the Blackhills area of South Dakota, causing slack December revenues.  Montana, with earlier snow than other district states, posted a good increase in December tourism compared to a year earlier.
Beef and grains, in contrast, show little change from early winter.  Prices for beef, corn, soybeans and wheat all remain depressed, but not as dramatically as hogs.  Strong 1998 grain yields provided some cushion against low prices, but unless prices improve many farmers expect to lose money in 1999.  One major Minnesota ag lender commented, "Farmers are coming in to update their financials and arrange credit lines right now.  There is not a single crop enterprise in our area that will produce enough cash flow to pay fixed costs using current prices for fall futures and five-year average yields.  If we had to cut off financing to everyone who cannot project positive cash flows we would close down 80 percent of our customers."
Price increases are rare at any level.  Fuels and red meat prices continue as bargains for many consumers.  Manufacturers report drops in prices of steel and nonferrous metals and in all petroleum-based chemicals or plastics.
