The Seventh District economy continued its modest pace of expansion as 1998 drew to a close and 1999 began, with little change in momentum.  Consumers appeared to be the major driving force behind economic growth.  Retail sales were generally above merchants' plans for the holiday season, although heavy promotional activity was necessary to attain these results.  New and existing home sales were, again, exceptionally strong as mortgage interest rates remained favorable.  While some key manufacturing sectors continued to feel the adverse impacts of turmoil overseas, the motor vehicle industry and construction-related industries remained very robust.  Overall lending activity was high, buoyed by household borrowing.  Employers in the region continued to find qualified labor in short supply, and there were a few new reports of intensifying wage pressures in some entry-level positions.  District farmers continued to face financial losses due to extremely low hog prices.
