The Fifth District economy expanded at a faster pace in the weeks since our last report, boosted by a pickup in consumer spending.  Retailers reported busy stores and stronger-than-expected sales during December.  Outside of retail, service sector activity was flat, held back in part by inclement weather in late December.  Manufacturing activity was mixed; output growth tapered off, but employment picked up after dropping in November.  Growth in commercial and residential real estate held up well and lending activity remained strong at financial institutions across the District.  Cold and icy weather in late December hampered tourism in many areas, but revived ski resorts, many of which had opened later than normal because of mild temperatures early in the month.  In labor markets, wage growth continued strong in retail and services, but slowed in manufacturing.  Prices of both goods and services were little changed at most District firms.
Looking forward, District producers remained optimistic about shipments and new orders during the next six months. They also anticipated that employment would increase and that wage levels would rise.
Commercial real estate activity lost some momentum in recent weeks but nonetheless, remained at a high level.  Several contacts expressed surprise that strong commercial leasing activity had continued through the holiday season which is typically a slow period.  Commercial rents edged up in most areas as vacancy rates continued to fall.  Looking forward, most realtors were optimistic about prospects for the commercial real estate market and for the overall economy in the coming year.
