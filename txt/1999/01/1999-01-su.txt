According to reports from business contacts in the twelve Federal Reserve districts, most regions are showing solid economic growth overall, despite mixed or weak results for individual sectors in some areas.  New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond report a pickup in activity recently, while Boston, Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco indicate that the pace of growth for at least some sectors has slowed.
Most districts report generally stable or declining prices for both producers and consumers, but exceptions exist.  For example, home prices are rising in some districts, fees for services are said to be up in Dallas, and Boston mentions price increases by selected manufacturers.  Energy and most agricultural prices are low by historical standards.  Retail discounting just before Christmas and around the turn of the year was more extensive than usual in some areas.
Reports from all districts mention labor market tightness, with Atlanta, Chicago, and Richmond recording heightened wage pressures in some sectors and St. Louis citing increased worker "poaching."  However, the Kansas City, Boston, and San Francisco districts say some extreme shortages have eased.
Looking forward, business contacts in most districts remain optimistic about 1999, especially the first half.  Philadelphia and Atlanta indicate that some contacts expect business activity to accelerate early this year.  However, respondents in most districts expect somewhat slower growth in 1999 than in 1998.
Retailers in many districts report a surge in sales late in the season, led by extensive price discounting, which brought inventories to desired levels.  Only in the St. Louis district are retail inventories said to be higher than desired.  Sales of consumer durables are reportedly strong in every district, with the most robust results in home appliances, home furnishings, consumer electronics, and automobiles.  By contrast, unseasonably warm weather in most of December weakened sales of winter apparel and tourist activity in many districts; some districts report a pickup in winter merchandise sales with the advent of cold weather.  Discount retailers reportedly profited more from the late buying surge than did department stores.
There is little evidence of price pressures at the retail level and most districts say that retail wages are rising moderately.  In almost all districts, retailers discounted extensively, but where consumer demand was very strong, less discounting occurred, leaving consumer prices about flat.
The Cleveland and Chicago reports cite strong production and expectations of continued strength in the motor vehicle industry.  Respondents in Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco indicate positive trends in construction-related manufacturing; in Dallas this sector is flat, although orders for cement remain at a high level.  Boston and San Francisco cite medical equipment as a bright spot.
Various districts mention depressed revenues for producers of paper, steel, agricultural equipment, and oil-related products.  Boston and Dallas report that the semiconductor industry is doing substantially worse than a year ago but seems poised to stabilize or improve in coming months.  Almost every district cites examples of manufacturers whose business is being hurt by weak exports, particularly to Asia.
In most cases, industrial prices are flat or falling.  Steel and paper prices reportedly are under intense downward pressure as a result of import competition (and, in the case of paper, weak demand).  Prices for refined petroleum and petroleum derivatives remain low or have fallen, and Dallas reports that full capacity utilization has resulted in "huge" inventories of home heating oil.  Chicago and Kansas City mention price increases for some construction materials.
Manufacturers face disparate labor market conditions across the country, according to district summaries.  For instance, Chicago indicates ongoing softness in the demand for manufacturing help, while San Francisco says that filling vacancies remains difficult.  On the whole, pay pressures in manufacturing seem unchanged or slightly more moderate than in the recent past.  Some workers are experiencing a weaker job market because of recent layoffs, especially in trade-sensitive sectors or regions.
Existing home sales are strong as well.  Parts of the Boston, New York, and Chicago districts tallied record sales of existing homes in November or December.  Other districts, including Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco report high but stable levels of sales.  Small or moderate increases in home prices are reported by Boston, New York, Richmond, and St. Louis.
The commercial real estate market is moderately active.  New York and Richmond report small increases in office rental rates.  Office vacancy rates are increasing slightly in the tight Manhattan market, but declining in Minneapolis-St. Paul and the Richmond district.
Conditions in energy and mining worsened late last year, according to respondents in Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas, despite the cold snap in late December that pushed natural gas prices up slightly.  Contacts in Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas report that U.S. rig counts are near post-World War II lows. The rig count has fallen 34 percent, year-over-year, in the Kansas City district and by even larger percentages in Montana and North Dakota.  Energy producers have cut exploration, capital spending, and production plans; demand for capital equipment and oil services is deteriorating, and, in the Dallas district, energy sector layoffs are widespread.  Contacts in the Minneapolis district also report that copper prices are near shutdown levels at Montana mines, while Minnesota and Michigan iron mines expect to see significant drops in output in 1999 because of increased imports of iron ore and finished steel.
