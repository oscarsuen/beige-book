The Seventh District economy continued to expand at a modest pace in May and early June as reports of intensifying price pressures became more frequent.  Sales of home-related items and light vehicles led strong consumer spending as consumers' resistance to price increases appeared to be softening.  Construction activity continued very strong even as shortages of labor and some types of building materials slowed some projects.  Manufacturing activity was robust with motor vehicles and construction-related industries running near capacity, while steel and agricultural equipment producers continued to struggle.  Despite a sharp dropoff in home refinancings, overall lending activity remained strong.  Labor markets were again tighter in the District than the nation as a whole, and reports of worker shortages and intensifying wage pressures became more widespread.  Farmers were still having difficulty repaying bank loans due to low commodity prices.  Corn planting in the District was nearly finished at the end of May while soybean planting was 80 percent completed.
