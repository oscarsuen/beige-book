The District economy continues to exhibit strong growth.  Retail sales were up between 4 and 5 percent from a year earlier, meeting most contacts' expectations.  Auto and light truck sales were not as brisk, but have showed renewed strength recently.  Manufacturers and other businesses continue to report growth in demand, which, in some instances, they are unable to meet because of persistent labor shortages.  Signs of growing upward wage pressures are emerging, as the strong demand for labor shows few signs of tapering off.  Residential real estate markets continue to boom throughout the District, while strong demand and shortages of available homes are driving up prices in some regions.  District loan demand and credit conditions have remained essentially unchanged over the past few months.  Supported by good soil moisture and ideal growing conditions, the spring planting proceeded as planned in most areas.
District auto dealers reported that sales, after a somewhat sluggish start in May, picked up by the end of the month.  Some GM dealers noted that a lack of inventory of popular models, particularly pickup trucks, hampered sales.  Other dealers reported that inventories are at desired levels.  Only one contact noted holding extra inventory because of the then-pending truckers' strike. Most dealers expect vehicle sales by the end of the year to be up moderately from last year.
The FedEx and UPS hubs continue to attract distribution centers to the region.  Several firms, including Amazon.com and an apparel manufacturer, have announced plans to open new distribution warehouses in the coming months.  The weak farming sector, however, has led to reduced orders for farm equipment.  One producer has eliminated overtime and cut its work schedule back from a seven-day to a five-day work week because of falling demand.  Because Boeing did not win new contracts for its F-15 fighter, about 7,000 jobs at its St. Louis plant will be eliminated as production is phased out by 2001.  Some analysts believe, however, that this layoff might help the region attract businesses that had previously been reluctant to come because of a shortage of qualified workers.
