The district economy remained solid in May but appears to have slowed from the rapid growth of recent years.  Extremely tight labor markets in much of the district may be contributing to the slowdown.  Retail activity slowed following strong performance earlier in the year, and construction also cooled from the burst of activity in March and April.  In contrast, manufacturing activity improved considerably from the sluggish conditions experienced in the recent past, and energy activity finally picked up in response to the recent increases in oil prices.  In the farm economy, the winter wheat crop remained in good condition, but losses continued for many livestock producers.  Although labor markets in most of the district remained very tight, wage pressures eased somewhat from previous surveys.  Retail prices continued to edge up, as did prices for construction materials, especially sheetrock.  After a long period of decline, prices for several manufacturing materials also began to rise.
