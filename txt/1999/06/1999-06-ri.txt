The Fifth District economy continued to advance at a rapid clip in late April and May.  Business services and financial firms reported stronger demand and retailers noted continued strength in automobile and housing-related sales.  Manufacturers continued to increase output and, in some cases, raise productivity.  The real estate sector remained upbeat; housing sales were brisk and commercial activity was strong in Virginia and the Carolinas.  Lending at banks remained strong although higher interest rates slowed the pace of mortgage refinancings.  Labor markets tightened further and wages rose somewhat faster in the retail and services sectors, but prices increased only moderately.  In agriculture, dry weather hampered spring planting and crop development in many areas of the District.
Commercial real estate activity was stronger in recent weeks, particularly in Virginia and the Carolinas.  The pickup in activity was most noticeable in Charlotte, N.C., where, according to one contact, there were "a lot of tenants making big space commitments ? big companies [that were] bullish on the market."  The acceleration included new retail, office, and warehouse developments.  In South Carolina, stronger growth was driven by new companies relocating to that area, which pushed rental rates higher.  But some realtors were less optimistic regarding continued strength in the sector.  In Northern Virginia and North Carolina, realtors were concerned that there may be insufficient demand to absorb the new office space coming to market.
