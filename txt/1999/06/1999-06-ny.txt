The District's economy continues to expand, though at a somewhat slower pace than in the last report.  While there are scattered reports of upward price pressures, they appear to remain relatively subdued.  Most retailers report that sales were above plan in May, despite unseasonably cool weather which held down sales of summer merchandise.  Residential real estate markets remain strong, though activity appears to have leveled off in the second quarter, largely due to supply constraints.
Regional purchasing managers report a slowdown in manufacturing activity in May, along with some upturn in input prices.  The breakup of Conrail and its recent merger into CSX and Norfolk Southern appears to have caused only minor operational glitches thus far.  Local banks report a dip in demand for residential mortgages and consumer loans, and continued improvement in delinquency rates.
Retail inventories are generally said to be at satisfactory levels, though one contact describes them as "a bit heavier than desired."  Most retailers report that selling prices and merchandise costs were flat to slightly lower, though one major chain notes an increase in costs for autumn private-label apparel imports.  Another large chain notes increasing wage pressures for entry-level workers.
Sales of existing single-family homes in New York State slowed somewhat in April.  However, realtors contend that demand continues to be exceptionally strong (as reflected in scattered bidding wars), and that activity is being held down by a shortage of available homes for sale--particularly in the counties adjacent to New York City, where the inventory is said to be at "historic lows."  Compared to a year ago, the number of homes on the market is down 35 percent in Nassau County and 25 percent in Westchester.  Even in the Buffalo area, where the economy has been sluggish, there are 10 percent fewer homes on the market than a year ago, while home sales are approaching record levels.
New York City's office market has shown further signs of stabilizing in April.  Office vacancy rates in Manhattan were little changed: Midtown's availability rate edged down from 8.1 percent to 7.7 percent, while Downtown's edged up from 11.8 to 11.9 percent.  Manhattan office rents also appear to have leveled off thus far in 1999--after rising by more than 20 percent during 1998, rents have barely changed since the beginning of this year, though they were up 14 percent from a year earlier in April.
The trucking industry is unlikely to be affected much by increased competition from this merger, according to an industry expert.  However, the recent jump in fuel prices may have a sizable effect on industry profits, as truckers will probably not be able to pass along the full cost increase to shippers.
Regional purchasing managers' surveys indicate some slowing in manufacturing activity in May, along with a rise in commodity price pressures.  Buffalo purchasers report that manufacturing activity slowed in May--production activity grew at a slower pace than in March and April, new orders remained flat, and employment edged down.  They also note a sharp upturn in commodity prices, which had been declining through most of 1998 and early 1999.  New York City area purchasing managers also report that manufacturing activity retreated in May, following strong growth in March and April, but that growth in non-manufacturing sectors remained solid.  Prices paid for commodities were little changed in May, while costs of contracted services rose at a somewhat slower pace than in April.
Hotel occupancy rates in New York City have ebbed from their peaks reached in early 1998 but remain exceptionally high--April's rate was 81 percent, down from 84 percent a year earlier.  Room rates continue to increase but at a much slower pace than last year; after rising more than 10 percent in 1998, rates have been running about 5 percent ahead of 1998 levels this year.  On a seasonally-adjusted basis, room rates have declined modestly from their peaks reached in the final quarter of 1998.
Changes in interest rates were mixed--residential mortgage rates increased, on balance, while rates on consumer loans declined.  Rates for nonresidential mortgages and commercial and industrial loans were generally stable.  Average deposit interest rates rose slightly, on balance.  Delinquency rates continued to fall for all categories of loans.
