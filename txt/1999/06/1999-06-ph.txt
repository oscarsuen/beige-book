Business activity in the Third District continued to increase in May.  Manufacturers in most of the region's major industrial sectors reported further gains in shipments and orders.  Retailers posted higher sales in May than in April, and year-over-year increases were generally strong.  Auto dealers also had improved sales in May compared to April.  Bankers indicated that demand for business loans was on the increase and real estate lending remained at a high level.  Consumer lending was rising, on balance, although some banks noted flat or falling personal lending.  Real estate markets have been active.  Home sales have been increasing, and commercial real estate leasing has been strong.
Looking ahead, most of the Third District businesses contacted for this report have positive outlooks.  Manufacturers forecast further increases in orders.  Retailers expect sales to remain on an upward trend.  Bankers expect overall lending to continue rising, led by an increase in business credit.  Builders and property managers anticipate more construction and leasing activity in the second half of the year.
The forecast for Third District manufacturing remains positive, on balance.  More firms expect increases than decreases in orders and shipments over the next six months.  A modest increase in order backlogs is predicted among the firms contacted for this report, but delivery times are expected to decrease a bit.  Some increases in employment and working hours are planned, but roughly two-thirds of area plants will hold workers and hours steady.
Auto dealers reported an increase in sales in May compared to April.  The continuing popularity of light trucks and manufacturers' incentives on sedans were bolstering the sales rate.  In general, dealers described inventories as appropriate for the  current pace of sales, although some said their supplies of the most popular types of vehicles were lean.
Commercial real estate markets in the District continued to tighten, according to local developers and property managers.  Leasing activity has been strong so far this year and rents have been rising.  Recent estimates of vacancy rates were around 5 percent in Wilmington, 13 percent in Philadelphia, and in a range of 5 to12 percent in suburban locations.  In most areas, office vacancy rates have decreased about one percentage point since the end of last year.   Industrial buildings continued to be in demand in the region, and conversion of older structures to nonindustrial uses has reduced availability and prompted construction of new space.  Most of the demand is for flex space and warehouses, although some new manufacturing facilities have been built recently.   Contacts in the commercial property industry said sources of private financing have become more active in the region, and they expect construction, leasing, and sales to increase through the rest of the year.
