The District economy continues to grow at a brisk pace.  Most contacts report growth in sales and demand.  Despite continuing difficulties filling some job vacancies, upward wage pressures remain at bay.  Housing markets throughout the District are still very strong, with many still on pace for record sales and growth this year.  District banks remain very healthy; however, booked loans have declined recently.  Despite persistent heat and the lack of adequate rainfall in July, crops remain in mostly good condition across District states.
UPS and FedEx continue to attract distribution operations to the regions near their hubs.  For example, BMW announced that it is building a new parts distribution center in northern Mississippi because of the area's proximity to Memphis.  A bit of the silver lining some analysts had anticipated from the recent Boeing layoffs has appeared, as several firms have expressed an interest in locating and expanding in the St. Louis region because of the recent availability of skilled machinists.  For instance, an aviation firm chose southern Illinois for its aircraft conversion and maintenance facility, which will initially employ between 300 and 350 workers.
Examples of weakness exist too.  For instance, contacts in the poultry-processing industry report an unusually weak season at a time when demand normally soars.  Falling feed prices are helping a bit, though.  Historically low prices in hog markets, coupled with increased competition from beef and poultry, have led to some slaughterhouse closings. General Electric noted that its current refrigerator production levels are outstripping previously anticipated demand; it plans to permanently lay off about 300 workers.
Activity in nonresidential real estate markets appears to have picked up over the past few weeks.  Some commercial real estate agents expect continued growth in demand for Class A office space.  Industrial markets, especially in the Memphis area, remain strong as demand for warehouse space continues to grow.
