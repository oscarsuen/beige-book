The district economy remained healthy in June and early July, but growth continued to slow from the brisk rate of last year.  The recent boom in construction appeared to subside somewhat, and manufacturing activity slowed slightly from a strong performance in May.  Retail activity was flat, although sales were still comfortably higher than a year ago.  District farmers faced cash flow concerns as grain prices continued to fall.  Labor markets in most of the district remained very tight, with wage pressures present but largely unchanged from previous surveys.  Retail prices continued to edge up, as did prices for construction materials.  Prices for some manufacturing materials fell.
