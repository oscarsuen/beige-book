Tight labor markets have helped push up collective bargaining settlements slightly for all industries except mining.  Overall wage increases vary from 3% to 3 3/4%.  However, concern over job security is reportedly easing wage pressures--some sources indicate having foregone wage gains in favor of a commitment on employment.  No wage growth is reported in the mining sector, which continues to suffer reversals, as low oil prices and environmental legislation have cut into the industry's growth rate.
Construction cost increases are generally modest, although drywall and lumber prices are rising due to short supply.  Labor costs are relatively stable, but contractors continue to have difficulty finding workers in the skilled trades.
Crop conditions are more favorable in the western reaches of the District, although conditions could change significantly over the next several weeks without additional rainfall.  The corn and soybean crops have developed ahead of schedule and remain in relatively good shape.  Still, crop prices are exceptionally low, presumably due to weak export markets, and many farmers are receiving federal crop subsidies.
Commodity price increases vary widely by item and industry, although most manufacturers observe more upward pricing power than earlier in the year.  Significant upward price movements are seen in paper and aluminum.
Sales of new vehicles have shown no sign of moderating during the traditionally slow summer season.  Dealers often reported sales levels up 10% to 15% over last year, and this pace is expected to hold through the end of the model year.  The rapid sales pace has resulted in lower-than-usual inventory levels at most dealerships.  Some dealers report a model-year sellout of some vehicles, including some full-size pickups.
Consumer and commercial loan delinquencies, already at low levels, improved further over the last six weeks.  Most banks reported that credit quality has improved as a result of tightened lending standards.  Still, the competition for borrowers is very tight and the spread between borrowing and lending rates is narrowing.
