Fifth District economic activity advanced at a brisk pace in June and July.  Retailers reported strong sales, particularly of automobiles, furniture, and apparel.  Business services and tourism revenues strengthened, and District manufacturers stepped up production and hiring.  At financial institutions, higher interest rates slowed mortgage lending but had little effect on the pace of commercial lending.  The real estate sector remained generally strong; home sales advanced at a rapid pace and prime commercial property continued to be highly sought.  Wages accelerated slightly in the retail sector but remained moderate in other sectors.  Prices of manufactured goods were generally flat and other prices rose only modestly.
Commercial real estate activity remained strong in recent weeks.  Realtors in the Washington, D.C., area and in parts of North Carolina said that it was increasingly difficult to locate large blocks of Class A office space.  A Raleigh, N.C., realtor said that he was busier now than four months ago as existing businesses continued to expand.  According to him, entrepreneurial businesses and individuals had filled Class B space almost to capacity.  In Washington, D.C., however, a realtor noticed a four-fold increase in available small rental space blocks, which he attributed to less expansion by area small businesses.  In Wilmington, N.C., a realtor described what he saw as the "first cracks" in the local market--he said that he was spending more time chasing smaller, lower-quality deals.
