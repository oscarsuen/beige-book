District reports indicate continued strength in economic activity, though there are widespread reports of supply constraints.  Retail sales, which had been robust in the second quarter, decelerated somewhat in July, in some cases due to low inventories of clearance merchandise.  Manufacturing activity continues to expand in most parts of the country, though a few districts indicate some softening.  Performance has varied substantially by industry: electronics, heavy trucks and construction materials continue to exhibit strength, while textiles and metals remain weak.  Residential construction and housing markets remain strong in most districts, though in some areas shortages of materials, labor, and available land have constrained home construction, delayed projects and boosted costs.  Commercial real estate markets remain tight in most districts; building is mixed but generally strong.  Tourism has generally been strong, especially in the Middle and South Atlantic seaboard regions.
Loan demand is steady or rising in most districts.  Although there has been some decline in residential mortgage lending, and especially refinancing activity, demand for commercial and industrial loans, as well as consumer (largely auto) loans, continues to grow briskly.  Expectations of large Midwest harvests have depressed grain prices, but drought conditions are hurting crops in the eastern part of the country.  The energy sector has shown some signs of improvement in recent weeks, as oil prices have continued to climb, but the level of drilling activity remains sluggish and lower than a year ago.
Widespread labor shortages persist in virtually every district, but there have been only scattered reports of an actual acceleration in wages.  Final prices of goods and services remain relatively stable for the most part.  There are some reports of accelerating prices--largely related to home construction--but there is no evidence of any broad-based pickup in consumer price inflation.
Automobile sales continue at high levels in most parts of the country.  In July, robust vehicle sales are reported in Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco.  Dealers in Cleveland report low inventories, with certain models sold out.  However, auto dealers in Philadelphia and Chicago say that sales slowed, following very brisk activity in June.
Weak or declining activity is reported in metals industries in Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco, and in the textile industry in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Atlanta.  Other reports of weakness come from makers of machine tools in Boston and San Francisco, farm equipment in Cleveland and Chicago, and commercial aircraft in St. Louis and San Francisco.  Manufacturers in the west--Dallas and San Francisco--report some pickup in exports to Asia; producers in the Boston district see only scattered signs of improvement in Asian markets.
Shortages of materials, labor and land are hindering construction and delaying projects in some areas.  Land shortages are cited in New York and Atlanta.  Labor shortages are indicated in New York, St. Louis, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco--mainly for skilled tradespeople, such as carpenters, framers, and masons.  Many districts also report problems in obtaining key construction materials, most notably drywall, insulation and bricks.  Home sales in Boston, New York and Atlanta are being limited by construction bottlenecks, combined with low inventories of existing homes.
Commercial real estate markets remain tight in most areas.  St. Louis indicates a pickup in activity, while New York, Richmond, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco report that conditions are steady and strong.  However, some contacts in the Cleveland and Dallas districts, though pleased with current conditions, express concern that vacancy rates have begun to rise.
Credit quality appears to have improved, on balance, since the last report.  New York, Cleveland and Chicago note an improvement in overall credit quality, while Atlanta and San Francisco indicate little or no change.  Lending standards are mostly unchanged, though New York and Cleveland report some tightening in standards.
The recent rise in oil prices has boosted activity in the Kansas City, Dallas, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts, though rig counts are still said to be well below last year's levels.  Dallas reports that most of the increase in activity is in small, low-risk projects, while major projects (off-shore and foreign drilling) continue to trend down.
Despite the labor shortages, none of the districts reports evidence of any broad-based acceleration in wages.  Still, there were scattered reports of accelerating or rapidly-rising wages--in biotechnology (Boston), construction (New York, Kansas City, San Francisco), retail (Philadelphia, Richmond), health-care (Atlanta), and transportation (Minneapolis).  In addition, strong wage increases for office workers with technical skills are reported in Chicago and Kansas City.  Aside from boosting wages, businesses are dealing with labor shortages in various ways: retailers in Boston are expanding performance-based compensation; businesses in Cleveland are providing job security commitments; truckers in St. Louis and builders in Kansas City are increasingly recruiting internationally and (in the latter case) using signing bonuses more than in the past.
Consumer prices remain relatively stable, despite some apparent intensification in input price pressures.  Manufacturers in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago indicate a general increase in input costs, although those in Boston report flat to declining input prices.  A number of districts indicate an acceleration in prices for certain materials--particularly construction materials such as drywall, lumber, bricks and insulation materials, as well as energy and transportation costs.  Also, steel and paper prices, though low, have turned up recently.  Agriculture and livestock prices, however, remain weak and are mostly down from a year ago.
