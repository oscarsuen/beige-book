Business conditions in the Third District generally improved during February. Manufacturing shipments and orders increased. Retail sales exceeded year-ago and prior month results. Auto sales have also increased. Bank real estate lending moved up slightly, but business and consumer lending has been steady. Sales of both new and existing homes have been rising strongly. Commercial real estate vacancies have been falling and rents have been rising.
Third District business contacts have positive outlooks. Manufacturers expect demand for their products to continue on an upward trend, and they plan to increase employment. Retailers anticipate further growth in sales as the spring season gets under way. Auto dealers expect sales to remain healthy. Home builders forecast construction at or above the current pace into the summer, and real estate agents expect sales of existing homes to remain strong. Commercial real estate contacts anticipate a balanced market and a steady pace of construction for the rest of the year.
Manufacturers in the District generally expect business to increase during the next six months. They forecast increases in orders and output, and they plan to add workers and lengthen the workweek. On balance, area manufacturers expect prices of both inputs and products sold to rise only modestly.
Sales of new motor vehicles have been on the rise. Dealers reported that manufacturers' shipments of popular models have increased recently, facilitating a better sales rate with less use of incentives. Dealers expect sales to remain at a strong pace, even if there is some slippage from the current rate.
Home builders and residential real estate agents reported a very brisk sales pace in February. Brokers estimate price appreciation of existing homes at around 3 percent over the past 12 months for most parts of the region, but gains have been higher in a few places. Mild weather accounts for some of the strength in February sales, according to builders and real estate agents, but they also cite buoyant consumer confidence and healthy personal income in the region as factors that should underpin a continuing high rate of sales.
