The District economy is still operating at a high level and growing moderately. Weakness in the agricultural sector is the only notable exception. The District's position as a distribution center continues to solidify, as UPS and FedEx attract more businesses to their hubs. District auto production is expected to increase because of a new line at a Ford plant. According to Manpower's second-quarter employment outlook survey, firms in the District's four major cities have upped their hiring expectations significantly from the previous survey. Most District metropolitan areas ended 1998 with more residential building permits issued than a year earlier; in several instances, it was a record year. Nonresidential real estate markets have been mixed. Total loans at large District banks have been down since the beginning of the year, with consumer loans seeing the biggest decline. Most major crop and livestock prices trended modestly lower since our last report.
The District continues to attract new businesses that see it as a distribution hub, especially in the Louisville and Memphis regions. The presence of UPS and FedEx and their geographic locations are most often cited as reasons for firms picking these areas. Several firms have announced that they have chosen the St. Louis region for their new service-response (calling) centers. The District furniture industry is seeing more mixed results recently. Larger, more efficient plants report continued strong sales, while smaller, less efficient plants are struggling due to cost disadvantages. District auto production will grow as Ford adds a line to produce its new sport-utility vehicle to the Louisville truck plant. Employment in St. Louis will receive a boost as Boeing consolidates its missile production there.
Several other reorganizations and consolidations, however, mean job losses. Declining domestic demand for cigarettes has led Philip Morris to announce it will close its Louisville plant. The ever-dwindling District apparel sector is seeing additional fallout: Levi Strauss is closing a plant because of slack demand for jeans, and a shirt manufacturer is shuttering its plant because of overseas competition. Some contacts mentioned a falloff in their exports because of the devaluation of the Brazilian real.
