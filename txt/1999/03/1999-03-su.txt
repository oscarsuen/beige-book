The districts reported some further gains in economic activity in January and February, despite weakness in agriculture and a few manufacturing industries. Consumer spending continued to display strength, aided by  post-holiday price discounting and mild weather in some regions. Motor vehicle sales increased, led by light trucks, and furniture sales benefited from robust home sales. Manufacturing activity expanded in most districts, although foreign competition and low energy prices depressed textile, apparel, and energy-related industries.
Commercial real estate and construction activity, already at a high level, grew at a brisk pace in most districts.  Residential construction was strong in most regions. Several districts reported a pickup in business lending, and a few noted that lenders' standards were stable to slightly tighter. Agriculture continued to be plagued by  low farm commodity prices, and an increasing number of farmers were under financial stress. Labor markets  remained tight. Finding qualified workers has become more difficult in several districts, and reports of faster wage increases were more widespread than in recent months. Prices of most goods remained little changed, and  several districts said that businesses remain reluctant to press for price increases.
Automobile sales increased in many districts in January and February. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas,  and San Francisco noted that motor vehicle sales--especially of sport-utility vehicles and light trucks--strengthened compared to December. Auto sales were lagging in Kansas City and flat in Minneapolis.
Two districts had upbeat reports on tourism. Resort activity was up from a year ago in the Atlanta District, while in Minneapolis skiing revenues were strong. In the Richmond District, mild weather damped revenues at ski areas but helped tourism in coastal regions. New York noted that their tourism boom had leveled off and that hotel occupancy rates had fallen.
Motor vehicle production moved higher in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco districts. In Cleveland and Chicago, heavy truck orders exceeded analysts' expectations in February and led some to raise their sales forecasts for 1999. The Boston and Richmond districts noted strength in the furniture industry, while  St. Louis characterized its furniture industry as mixed. Several districts noted that shipments of semiconductors and high-tech equipment increased. Expectations for business conditions in coming months were mostly positive. Boston, for example, reported that most manufacturers' expectations were positive but cautious for 1999. Producers in the Philadelphia and Richmond districts expected orders and output to increase over the next six months.
Contacts in the Chicago District indicated that existing home sales have slowed since December. Housing sales were described as brisk in the New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas districts. New home purchases were above the previous year's level in Kansas City and builders there were optimistic about the next few months. Home prices moved higher in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis districts.
In the Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City districts, construction costs increased in recent weeks. Drywall and insulation shortages, as well as tight markets for skilled labor, placed upward pressure on prices. In contrast, San Francisco reported that lower labor costs in Utah and sluggish activity in Oregon had slowed construction cost increases in those areas.
Commercial real estate activity remained strong in most districts, although there were a few reports of slowing activity. Competition for commercial space intensified in the Carolinas. Rental rates rose in the New York and Philadelphia districts, and reached record high levels in the San Francisco Bay area. Chicago and Minneapolis noted faster growth in construction activity, particularly of public works projects. Boston reported an uptick in activity around Hartford, Connecticut, with several new construction projects planned. In contrast, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco reported slowdowns in new construction, while activity in the Cleveland District was described as flat. Office leasing was said to be leveling off in Boston, and in the St. Louis District vacancy rates rose in central business districts.
Reports on credit quality and delinquency rates were mixed. Chicago said that credit quality improved and New York reported lower delinquency rates for all types of loans. Cleveland, however, noted that many banks reported higher delinquency rates. In addition, automobile dealers in the Cleveland District expressed concerns about the credit worthiness of some new car buyers. San Francisco said that the only report of deteriorating credit quality was from the Oregon coast, where loan delinquencies rose.
Temporary employment firms faced strong demand for their services in January and February. Boston and Chicago indicated that more businesses had recently turned to temporary employment firms to find workers. Cleveland and Richmond reported that temporary help firms were unable to meet their clients' demand for workers, raising the probability of future wage increases. The demand for contingent workers was mixed in the Dallas District, where requests from telecommunications firms, call centers, and banks remained at high levels, although demand from manufacturing and oil companies slackened.
Manufacturing employment was mixed across districts in January and February. St. Louis manufacturers increased their workforces, and plants in the Philadelphia District planned to add workers and lengthen the workweek in coming months. Boston and Richmond reported steady manufacturing employment, while declines were cited by New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.
The Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts reported greater upward wage pressures in January and February. Generally stable wages were reported by New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco. Most districts indicated that higher wage costs were absorbed by businesses.
Low commodity prices and a perceived lack of pricing power by firms helped keep prices stable during January and February. Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported generally steady prices, while Dallas indicated that price declines outnumbered price increases in that district. Rising lumber and drywall prices were reported by Cleveland and Minneapolis, while insulation and sheetrock prices inched up in the Kansas City District. Escalating health care costs continued to plague employers in the Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts.
