In early 1999 the pace of Ninth District business activity has picked up from the strong conditions reported at the beginning of the year, although natural-resource based industries remain in the doldrums. Businesses and forecasters are more optimistic now than in December. The forward momentum continues for construction, consumer spending and manufacturing. Low commodity prices continue to depress farm income, curb iron mining and stall oil exploration. Businesses would like to hire additional workers and are raising wages to attract them. They, however, are reporting few other price increases.
Vehicle registrations increased significantly in South Dakota for the month of January compared to a year earlier, but decreased slightly in North Dakota. A North Dakota auto dealer association spokesperson expects the trend in auto sales to be "flat at best," due to the lagging agriculture and oil sectors.
After a slow start in December, winter tourism picked up in January and February. In northern Minnesota a major ski hill recorded record weekends in January and February, following a weak December. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan most motels were full on weekends in February, as contrasted to vacancies in December. South Dakota ski resorts also report a strong season, but a lack of snow has slowed snowmobiling. Meanwhile, in northern Montana business at a ski resort has been up only slightly from a year ago, due to the unfavorable exchange rate with Canada.
Weak foreign economies, however, continue to constrain manufacturing. The Asian economic collapse has weakened demand for paper, and a major paper manufacturer recently announced the closing of a plant in northwestern Minnesota. Moreover, two western Wisconsin manufacturers attribute soft sales to weakinternational business, and according to a regional survey of purchasing managers, Minnesota manufacturers tied to international markets, especially high tech, continue to report problems.
Meanwhile, "oil exploration is at a standstill," reports a bank director. No rigs are currently working in North Dakota and only five in Montana as compared to 16 and 9, respectively, a year ago.
"The low commodity and livestock prices are drastically taking their toll on the net worth/capital of the farmers and drastically diminishing their ability to repay loans," reports a local agriculture lender. Based on preliminary results of the Ninth District's first quarter survey of agricultural credit conditions, 61 percent of respondents reported a below normal rate of loan repayment compared to 51 percent of the fourth quarter survey respondents. In both the first quarter 1999 survey and the fourth quarter 1998 survey approximately 70 percent of respondents reported farm income decreases from the previous year's levels.
In addition to innovative incentives and recruiting schemes to attract workers, employers are raising wages. A telemarketing firm recently boosted its starting wage to $7.50 an hour from $6.75. Plus, several large district firms indicated that they are increasing wages 4 percent to 5 percent this year. Increasing health insurance premiums are pushing up compensation costs, states a Minnesota union official.
While firms have to raise wages, they "can't increase prices," says a Minneapolis/St. Paul banker. Competitive pressures are keeping firms from raising prices, but low import prices are helping many of them to keep their costs down. Seventy percent of participants to a survey of Upper Midwest business reported stable or declining prices for their products, the same percentage as in December. Construction input prices, however, have been rising, due to the strong pace of building activity.
