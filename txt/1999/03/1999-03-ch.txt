The Seventh District economy continued to expand modestly in early 1999, despite weakness in some of the region's mainstay industries. Consumer spending remained strong, exceeding many merchants' expectations. Home sales slowed somewhat from December's torrid pace, but overall construction activity remained brisk. Manufacturing activity was mixed as strength persisted in some key industry segments, such as motor vehicles, while softness continued in others, particularly steel and agricultural equipment. Lenders indicated that loan demand remained strong even as mortgage refinancing activity fell off somewhat. Worker shortages persisted in the District and there were a few new reports of increasing wages in entry-level positions. Low commodity prices and a poor farm income outlook helped push farmland values down in Illinois and Iowa during the last three months of 1998.
