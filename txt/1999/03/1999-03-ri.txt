Fifth District economic activity continued to advance at a healthy pace during the past two months. Retailers reported robust sales and brisk shopper traffic but services providers gave mixed reports. In manufacturing, shipments rose modestly and producers expressed more optimism regarding future business prospects. Real estate activity in the District continued upbeat, despite a somewhat slower pace of expansion in commercial activity in some areas. Loan demand remained generally strong across the District. Mild weather in January and February helped District crops and boosted tourist activity at coastal resorts but reduced patronage at ski resorts. Labor markets tightened, although wage increases remained moderate. Prices changed little in manufacturing and rose only slightly in the services sector.
Commercial real estate activity also remained strong in recent weeks, although the pace of growth slowed somewhat outside of the Carolinas. A Washington, D.C., realtor said that people were simply "running out of steam" in his area. In contrast, activity in the Carolinas remained robust; one North Carolina agent likened the market there to a "runaway freight train." Competition for commercial space in the Carolinas has intensified in recent weeks. A Raleigh, N.C., realtor said that tenants were willing to pay additional "fees" in return for priority access to available retail space. According to a contact in Columbia, S.C., small tenants in that area were being "forced out of buildings" once their leases expired to make room for expansion by larger, more established tenants.
