The district economy continued to grow moderately last month. Retail sales again posted solid gains, and manufacturing registered its first improvement in months. Construction activity eased slightly due to colder weather but remained well above last year's pace. Energy activity declined as prices took another turn for the worse. In the farm economy, the winter wheat crop was in good condition, but hog farmers continued to suffer from low prices. Labor markets remained very tight in most of the district, with wage pressures - especially in the construction sector - increasing somewhat from the previous survey. Prices remained flat at the retail level and mixed for manufacturing materials, while prices for some construction materials began to rise.
