The Eleventh District economy continued to expand in February and early March, with some sectors reporting stronger activity than in the last beige book. Retailers said sales growth was stronger than expected, and some manufacturing sectors reported improved sales. Real estate activity picked up, but there continued to be some concerns about overbuilding, particularly apartments. Business service firms reported little change in activity overall. Most financial institutions reported a strong start to 1999, with the exception of banks lending to the agricultural and energy industries. Drilling activity continued to plunge, reducing demand for energy service and manufacturing firms. Dry conditions remain a concern for agricultural producers, with many farmers and ranchers still in serious financial jeopardy after last summer's drought and low commodity prices.
