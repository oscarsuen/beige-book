District temporary employment agencies indicate steady demand, overall, and report continued difficulty finding and retaining qualified workers.  While there appears to have been a decline in the demand for general labor, such as entry level clerical and assembly line production workers, agencies note a sharp increase in orders for legal and executive secretaries, account executives, bookkeepers, engineers, and information technology specialists.
Tight labor markets have prompted temporary help agencies to raise wages.  For some, wage growth has been substantial, as in the case of administrative assistants, who have seen hourly wages rise by about 20% since this time last year.
Union sources also note a shortage of skilled workers, and higher training and development costs are reported for steel workers.  Wage growth has risen for virtually every industry, with growth rates ranging from about 3-5%.
Reports from commercial contractors are more mixed than for their residential counterparts, although most respondents report that conditions are holding steady at a relatively high level.  Materials shortages and rising cost pressures have been seen, and some commercial builders report rationing by drywall distributors.  Other commercial builders report a higher backlog among subcontractors.
Recent rains in some regions of the District have improved pasture lands, but grazing conditions are still poor.  Farmers in southern Ohio and eastern Kentucky are feeding hay to their livestock, and some farmers are paring down their herds.  Tobacco is also suffering from the drought, and some areas of eastern Kentucky are expected to show yields 30-40% below normal.
Foreign steel imports remain high.  Still, the demand for steel is high due to strong orders in the auto and construction industries.  Several steel companies in the District have announced 5-7% price increases on stainless steel products and many have reduced their price discounting, although prices are still low relative to their peaks of a few years ago.  Industry sources report no inventory stockpiling in anticipation of a Y2K disruption.
Sales of new vehicles remain brisk.  Most contacts report light or insufficient inventory due to the strength of this summer's sales, although inventory positions appear to have improved with the arrival of the new model year.  Dealers anticipate strong sales for the remainder of 1999.
The rate for loan delinquencies is holding at very low levels.  Credit quality is good and no change in credit standards is reported.  The spread between borrowing and lending rates is narrowing in accordance with the observed long-term trend.  Competition for borrowers is still fierce, but some sources report an easing from a year ago.  No identifiable Y2K-related change in customer deposit behavior has been observed.
