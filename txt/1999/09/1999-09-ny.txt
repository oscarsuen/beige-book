The District's economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, with an acceleration in manufacturing activity largely offset by some slowing in retail sales.  While there has been some acceleration in input prices, there has been no broad-based increase in consumer price inflation.  Retailers report that sales were slightly below plan, on balance, in August, but picked up again in early September; most report less discounting than usual thus far in the third quarter. Housing demand remains strong, especially in the New York City area, but activity appears to be limited by supply constraints--low inventories of both new and existing homes and a shortage of usable land appear to be constraining unit sales while boosting prices. Manhattan's office market appears to have stabilized.
Regional purchasing managers report that manufacturing activity accelerated in August, while price pressures intensified.  Banks report steady loan demand, further tightening in credit standards, and continued improvement in delinquency rates.
Inventories were said to be in good shape at the end of August--even among those with disappointing sales.  One major discount chain, where sales have been persistently strong, reports that inventories are a bit lean, especially if the current sales pace continues.  While selling (ticket) prices and merchandise costs have been stable, most contacts report substantially less discounting than usual during the third quarter.  Most retail contacts continue to report widespread labor shortages, but no significant acceleration in wages.  However, one large chain reports that it is giving significant increases to workers at the low end of the pay scale.  Also, in response to labor shortages, a number of New Jersey retailers are said to be involved in welfare-to-work programs to recruit and train entry-level workers.
The market for existing homes is also tight.  A large New York City realtor describes current market conditions as "unbelievably strong" and indicates that both unit sales and prices of prime-area co-ops and condos are running 10-15 percent ahead of a year ago.  The sharpest price increases are for high-end properties, and there are continued reports of bidding wars.  Also, homes remain on the market for an unusually short time.  Statewide, single-family existing home sales slowed in July--they were virtually unchanged from a year earlier, while prices rose by 5 percent, in line with recent trends.  In the New York City area, prices continue to rise briskly, but unit sales are below year-ago levels.  This is widely attributed to a dearth of single-family homes on the market.
Manhattan's commercial real estate market appears to have stabilized, as office availability rates were little changed in July, after falling to cyclical lows at the end of June.  Midtown's rate edged up from 7.2 percent to 7.3 percent, while Downtown's rate decreased from 11.6 percent to 11.4 percent. Office rents, which had surged more than 20 percent in 1998, have risen only modestly so far this year.
Hotel room rates remained little changed in July--after posting double-digit gains in each of the preceding four years, they are running just 2.5 percent ahead of a year ago in 1999.  In contrast, a major newspaper raised its local daily newsstand price by 25 percent in early September.
