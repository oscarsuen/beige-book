All district economies continue to exhibit overall strength, with most experiencing moderate-to-brisk rates of growth.  Retail sales are generally up in most districts, with back-to-school sales meeting or exceeding retailers' expectations in many cases.  Vehicle sales remain robust, although some dealers are unable to meet demand for popular models.  Industrial activity is on the rise in most parts of the country, with orders and production both up.  In some cases, resurgent Asian demand is contributing to this rise in activity.  Although commentary from most district reports continues to highlight widespread labor shortages, several districts have noted a slackening in the demand for labor.  There are few reports of acceleration in nominal wages and salaries, although some districts note a substantial upswing in the cost of health-care benefits.  While price pressures at the consumer level remain mostly calm, numerous districts report significant increases in some materials prices.  Home sales and construction remain elevated, but many districts have begun noticing a slowdown.  Commercial real estate markets are tight in many districts.  Loan demand, except for residential real estate loans, is well-sustained across districts.  Credit quality and standards remain unchanged, for the most part.  The recent drought has worsened crop and livestock conditions in the East and parts of the Midwest.
Auto sales, particularly of new vehicles, remain strong in most parts of the country.  The Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City and St. Louis districts note substantial gains in auto sales, while the Richmond district reports a weakening of sales, due mostly to hot weather.  Consequently, dealer inventories in the Richmond district are up.  On the other hand, some dealers in the Cleveland, Philadelphia and St. Louis districts are still having difficulty stocking enough popular models to meet demand; inventories are not a concern for dealers in the Kansas City district.
The production of apparel appears to be down across the board.  Orders for heavy trucks and construction and agricultural equipment have weakened at Chicago district firms.  While the tobacco industry in the St. Louis district is experiencing a slackening in domestic demand, tobacco shipments from Richmond district firms remain strong.  The commercial aerospace industries in the Atlanta and San Francisco districts report weakening demand.
The Philadelphia district notes that manufacturing inventories are at desired levels.  The Atlanta district comments that a maker of batteries and flashlights expects heavy demand around year-end and, therefore, plans to increase its inventory accordingly.  Cleveland district contacts report no inventory stockpiling, while San Francisco district contacts have seen their excess inventories drawn down recently.  Contacts in the Kansas City district plan to trim inventories soon because they are getting too high.
The majority of district reports indicate that price pressures at the retail level are not readily apparent.  Where they are apparent, they are categorized as temperate.  Prices pressures at the wholesale level appear to be somewhat greater.  The Chicago, Cleveland and Richmond districts report price increases at manufacturers, with steel makers in the Cleveland district announcing hikes of between 5 and 7 percent.  The Atlanta, Cleveland, Kansas City, Philadelphia and Richmond districts all report that  higher raw materials costs are evident.  The Dallas district adds that construction costs (both labor and materials) are up between 5 and 8 percent so far this year.  The San Francisco district, however, notes that prices for manufacturers' inputs have been "stable or declining."
Commercial real estate markets are tight in the Boston and Philadelphia districts, although real estate agents in the Philadelphia district believe that demand there may be peaking.  The Cleveland district reports that nonresidential market conditions remain at a high level.  Speculative nonresidential building is up in the St. Louis district.  Apartment construction is strong in parts of South Dakota because of low vacancy rates.
Livestock in the Cleveland, Dallas and Richmond districts are in poor-to-fair condition.  Many farmers in the Cleveland and Richmond districts have begun feeding hay to their herds because of poor pasture conditions.  Some farmers in the Cleveland district have even started paring down the sizes of herds.  In the Kansas City district, however, low feed costs, stronger cattle prices and increasing profits are leading to a rebuilding of herds.
Strong demand for natural gas has increased prices and drilling activity in the Dallas and Kansas City districts.  With the price of oil also on the rise, the number of rigs on-line in the Kansas City district has been rising.  In the Minneapolis district, though, the rig count is below year-ago levels.
