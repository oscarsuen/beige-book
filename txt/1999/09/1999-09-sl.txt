Car dealers report relatively strong year-over-year sales gains in July and August--in many cases, up more than 10 percent.  The demand for pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles continues to outstrip the supply, hampering some dealers' sales.  While vehicle prices, for the most part, remain unchanged, values of rebates have recently increased somewhat.  Dealers remain optimistic about fourth-quarter sales, assuming they can get the inventory to meet the anticipated demand.
Several firms are planning to expand or move to the District.  Four firms, for example, chose to expand or move to the Louisville and Memphis areas because of their accessibility to the FedEx and UPS hubs.  All told, these firms will create nearly 2,000 jobs.  A scattering of downsizings has also been reported.  Philip Morris eliminated another 300 jobs, as domestic demand for tobacco products falls, and GE has cut employees from its refrigerator and laundry divisions.  Several sources, however, believe that other firms will quickly absorb many of these workers.  Some contacts reported production suspensions due to energy conservation days during the recent hot weather.
