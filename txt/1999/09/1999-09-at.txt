The pace of District nonresidential construction is slightly ahead of a year ago but varied significantly across the different states in the District.  Contacts in Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee report construction is moderately above last year's levels, while in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi construction is seen at below year-ago levels.  Office, industrial, and retail markets in the region generally remain balanced.  The pace of District multifamily construction remains similar to our last report, up modestly from a year ago.
Prices remain generally stable, but more reports than in recent Beige Books indicate increases.  Florida contacts indicate that some import prices are beginning to firm as Asian markets recover.  Other contacts report that in some parts of the District health insurance and pharmaceutical prices are rising at double-digit rates.  One contact notes that the cost of raw materials for chemical producers is rising because of increasing prices of petroleum based feedstock.  Although the shortage of building material in parts of the District has been alleviated, earlier price increases appear to be holding.
