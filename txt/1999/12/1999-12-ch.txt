The Seventh District's economy remained strong in October and early November but was expanding more slowly than earlier in the year.  Reports on consumer spending were mixed, with contacts noting strong sales growth for the first weekend of the holiday shopping season.  Construction activity generally was strong, despite softening on the residential side.  Overall manufacturing output remained strong, but conditions were varied across industry segments.  Lenders reported conditions similar to those noted in our last report, and contacts reported no signs of Y2K-related surges in inventory borrowing or cash demand.  The District's labor markets remained much tighter than the rest of the nation and seasonal demand put additional strain on some sectors of the market.  The fall harvest was complete, as was the planting of winter wheat.  A survey of agricultural bankers indicated that slow farm loan repayments continued to be a problem.
