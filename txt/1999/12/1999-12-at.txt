Single-family construction and new home sales have been flat, and the pace of District nonresidential construction is slightly ahead of a year ago but varied across the different states in the District.  Overall loan demand and funds availability continue to expand at a moderate rate.  While factory production has recently increased, the near-term outlook is a little less positive than before.

More reports indicate increasing pharmaceutical prices.
