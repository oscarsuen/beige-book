Reports from most Federal Reserve Districts indicated continued moderate to strong economic growth in October and November. Growth was described as strong in the New York, Richmond, Dallas, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts, and moderate in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Atlanta Districts.  Further growth was reported in the Chicago District but at a slower rate than earlier in the year.  In the Cleveland, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts, business conditions were little changed.
Consumer spending picked up over the Thanksgiving weekend, after being hampered by warm weather earlier in November.  Manufacturing activity continued to advance in most Districts.  Commercial real estate markets remained strong in most parts of the country.  Home sales have slipped.  Agricultural conditions were mixed, and low prices persist for grains and some other commodities.  Oil and gas drilling has increased.  Bank lending has declined for residential mortgages but risen for consumer loans.  Lending to businesses has risen in some Districts but declined in others.
Labor markets remain tight in all Districts.  The pace of wage and salary increases did not appear to be accelerating generally, although there were some reports of larger recent salary increases in some industries and regions.  Prices appear to be mostly steady at the retail level.  Reports from manufacturers have been mixed.  Although prices of industrial goods were reported to be mostly steady in a majority of Districts, prices of some goods have been on the rise.
Auto sales slipped in November in Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas.  Dealers in several of those Districts think the slowdown has been seasonal and that car and truck buying will pick up in January.  Cleveland reported an increase in motor vehicle sales.
The advance in manufacturing activity has been broad-based.  Boston reported strong demand for pharmaceuticals and instruments; Cleveland noted rising activity among steel manufacturers; Richmond indicated rising output of processed food products; and Atlanta and Dallas saw increases in production of chemicals.  Other products said to be growing in demand were plastics and automotive parts (St. Louis) and furniture (Boston and Richmond).  Some sectors have lagged, however.  Output of industrial equipment was down in Boston and Richmond, aerospace production slowed in Philadelphia and San Francisco, and demand for textiles and apparel weakened in Richmond and Atlanta.
Residential construction activity was mixed around the nation, with more regions experiencing slowdowns than increases.  Reports of declining rates of housing construction came from Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, and Chicago, and New York indicated a sharp drop.  The Kansas City District reported continuing growth in homebuilding, but contractors in the District expect a slowdown in coming months.  Several Districts said real estate agents noted declines in existing home sales as mortgage interest rates rose, but some agents also said sales had eased because fewer houses were being put on the market.
Some agricultural commodities have been disappointing.  Richmond and St. Louis indicated that cotton yields and quality declined compared with last year.  Recently planted  winter wheat was said to be suffering from dry soil conditions in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts, and in parts of the St. Louis District.  However, Kansas City reported that winter wheat in that District was in good condition.  Low levels of soil moisture were also said to be adversely affecting field conditions and forage generally in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts.
Interest rate margins were said to be tightening at commercial banks in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts.  Bankers in the San Francisco District said margins remained narrow.  Credit standards have remained unchanged in most Districts, although Cleveland bankers were imposing stricter conditions for consumer loans and Chicago bankers indicated that standards for commercial loans have been eased.  Consumer credit quality was reported to be improving in the New York, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts.  Dallas noted a rise in commercial loan delinquencies.
Wage increases were described as persistent in most Districts.  Reserve Banks received reports of increases ranging from 3 to 10 percent on an annual basis.  Although the rate of increase did not appear to be accelerating generally, there were some reports of higher recent salary increases in some industries and regions.  Richmond District employers noted substantial wage increases recently.  Atlanta noted significant increases in compensation for health-care workers.   The use of signing bonuses has spread, according to reports from several Districts.
