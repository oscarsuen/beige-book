The district economy held steady in October and early November after showing some signs of weakness in previous surveys.  Manufacturers reported higher levels of activity, the construction sector remained solid, and energy activity continued a rebound that began in the spring.  Retail sales declined again but are expected to be strong through the holidays.  In the farm economy, the winter wheat crop was in good condition despite dry weather.  Labor markets in most of the district remained very tight, but reports of wage pressures edged down from the previous survey.  Retail prices were flat, while prices for some construction and manufacturing materials rose further.
