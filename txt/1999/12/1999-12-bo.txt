The First District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Most contacts in the retail and manufacturing sectors report rising revenues and steady headcounts.  While materials costs and vendor prices are generally holding steady, wages are rising and some retailers, manufacturers, and temporary employment firms are obtaining higher selling prices.
Permanent employment is said to be holding steady.  Seasonal hiring has been difficult because of tight labor markets, but for the most part these difficulties are not impinging on retailers' operations.  Retailers report that base wages are increasing at a 4 to 7 percent rate, but performance-based incentive plans are not generally being altered in response to the tight labor market.
Both upscale and discount general retailers report some increases in selling prices; while list prices are holding steady, they are undertaking less discounting than in the recent past.  As a result, profit margins are up in these sectors.  Contacts selling furniture, by contrast, say that prices, costs, and margins are holding steady.
Respondents report modest plans for capital expansion over the next six months.  Most contacts say that the economy is currently very strong and they expect a continuation of strong sales growth through the Christmas holiday season.  Looking beyond the holiday season, retailers are cautiously optimistic, with some expecting consumer spending to moderate in the first quarter of 2000.
A firm that produces automotive parts and another that produces paper products report an upward blip in business attributable to Y2K.  However, a provider of information systems says that customers in industries such as finance and accounting are requesting deferral of major installations until early 2000.
A majority of the manufacturers contacted indicate that materials costs are flat; a few mention having long-term contracts.  Some others have experienced selective increases but express little concern because they can pass them on or offset them.  By exception, a couple of firms making heavy use of paper indicate negative impacts from continuing cost increases.  Many manufacturers indicate that their selling prices remain unchanged.  Some firms in the paper and publishing industries note price increases, mostly modest.  Makers of machinery and equipment tend to report continuing downward pressures, prompting some to give further consideration to shifting production to foreign locations.
Most respondents report steady headcounts.  Many indicate that labor markets remain tight, with some contacts noting increased pay pressures or production constraints.  For example, a couple of contacts indicate that turnover has increased and salary pressures are rising as a result of competition for employees on the part of Internet-related and other start-up firms.  Another expects to set up a foreign operation for technical projects because of labor shortages domestically.  Reported health insurance cost increases for 2000 are mostly in the double digits, higher than in recent years.
About one-third of the manufacturers contacted express optimism about revenue growth prospects in 2000.  The remaining firms are more cautious and generally expect to face increasing challenges in controlling costs.  Several respondents indicate that consolidation on the part of customers is likely to constrain prices and demand for their products.
Respondents generally report upcoming annual merit salary increases in the 3 to 4 percent range.  Information technology (IT) professionals remain in high demand, and are generally expected to receive larger than average merit increases or to benefit from special compensation programs.  However, insurers report some indications that pressures in the IT labor market may be lessening.  One contact notes that turnover rates among IT workers have dropped, another reports no compensation pressures for IT staff, and two others say they have no trouble hiring IT workers.
