Contacts reported solid expansion of economic activity in the Twelfth District during recent weeks.  Further growth in consumer demand fueled rapid sales of retail merchandise and services.  Due in part to improved trade conditions, District manufacturing activity expanded further, and demand and prices increased slightly for District agricultural producers.  Real estate markets remained highly active, especially in California, although commercial and residential markets have cooled a bit in some regions.  Financial institutions reported strong demand for credit and vigorous competition among lenders.  Despite reports of labor and materials shortages in some sectors, upward pressure on wages and prices was modest overall.
Many retail and service contacts reported difficulty finding entry-level and skilled workers.  Upward wage pressure was moderate on net, however, as employers relied on other incentives, such as increased merchandise discounts for seasonal employees.  Reported price increases also were limited; costs have been held down by productivity enhancements at some firms, and prices more generally were restrained by vigorous competition.
