Business activity in the Third District moved up, on balance, in November, although in some sectors of the regional economy growth has slowed.  Manufacturers posted gains in shipments and new orders.  Retail sales remained on an upward trend, and most stores reported solid year-over-year gains for the Thanksgiving weekend.  Auto sales were steady during November.  Bank lending has been flat as increases in consumer credit have been offset by decreases in real estate lending and business loan volume has been level.  Residential and nonresidential construction have been easing recently, but real estate agents indicated that sales of existing homes have been steady.  Employment continued to grow in the region, and firms in nearly all industries have reported difficulty in meeting their needs for workers.  Staffing of stores for the Christmas shopping period was described as especially problematic.
Looking ahead, business contacts in the District have mixed views, although some step-up in activity is expected overall.  Manufacturers forecast increases in shipments and orders.  Retailers expect sales for the holiday shopping period to exceed last year's level, and auto dealers anticipate an upturn in car and truck sales after the turn of the year.  Bankers expect lending to strengthen next year as well.  Construction activity may slip further, according to builders, especially for commercial office buildings, but public construction is expected to remain strong.
Manufacturers' inventories of raw materials and supplies rose slightly in November.  A few firms indicated they had ordered increased quantities of critical inputs to ensure continued operation in the event of supply interruptions related to possible Y2K problems.  Besides the firms that have already added to inventories, other firms indicated that they plan to boost inventories closer to the end of the year.  For firms that have already added to inventories and those that plan to, the increased amounts represent around one week's supply of those inputs.
Third District manufacturers generally expect growth to continue at about its current pace during the next six months.  Although some firms forecast increases in their order backlogs, most expect to be able to meet rising demand for their products without delays in filling orders.  Expectations of price increases persist.  Nearly half of the firms surveyed in November anticipate paying higher prices for inputs in the next six months, and one-fourth plan to raise prices for the products they make.
Auto dealers said sales have slowed recently but remain well above last year's pace.  The slowdown is seasonal, according to the dealers; they expect a pickup after the year-end holidays.  Inventories were said to be in line with sales, overall, but manufacturers have boosted rebates to step up sales of leftover 1999 models.
Residential real estate agents generally indicated that the pace of existing home sales was steady in November and above the rate set in November last year.  Sales of new homes appeared to have eased.  Builders continued to report that labor shortages were causing delays in construction even at the slower sales rate.  Price increases, for both new and existing homes were slowing, according to realtors and builders.
