Orders have exceeded expectations for many firms. Another maker of hydraulic parts reports a current backlog equal to about 80 percent of current annual volume.
Many contacts say they currently are comfortable with employment levels but see some prospects for hiring in the near future. Producers of hydraulic equipment expect to hire as demand, especially from foreign firms, increases. An Indiana appliance producer will add 1,800 hourly employees this spring because of increasing foreign demand. A Kentucky poultry processor announced an expansion that will add 300 jobs.
Some firms continue to contract, however. Large defense-related firms continue to reduce employment as government and foreign demand fall. St. Louis will lose one of its three auto plants, which employs about 3,800 workers, by the end of this year. In addition, a pharmaceutical company in Indiana eliminated more than 200 jobs as it reduced the size of its company. Many small manufacturers report difficulty obtaining bank financing. In particular, they are concerned about their dwindling lines of credit; as they pay down credit lines, banks are concurrently lowering their caps.
