The economy of the Ninth District appears to be growing modestly. Consumer spending, especially on retail sales and tourism, together with construction continue to be the engines pulling the economy forward.
Other sectors are less positive. Labor markets are static. Paper producers, squeezed by low prices, have cut output and employment. Some mine production is down and new mining layoffs are reported. Declining crop and milk prices are cited as a cause of reduced farm spending.
Advisory council members, Ninth District directors and newspapers all report a good winter tourism season across the district.
District directors and advisory council members report plans for new retail outlets in every Ninth District state. Some also note plans for substantial heavy construction in 1993. An Upper Peninsula director says that planned construction in her city is considerably above average and consists of a mix of municipal, residential and commercial projects. A Montana director notes dam, power plant and refinery construction or renovation.
A supercomputer firm in Wisconsin closed in response to losses at a major financial backer, wiping out 320 well-paying jobs. And 100 hospital workers were laid off in Great Falls, Mont., a significant blow in that small labor market. A Minnesota-based airline will lay off 123 pilots April 1.
South Dakota and Montana sawmills face financial pressures from a different source. Timber supplies are tight, due in part to reduced cutting allocations in national forests, and output is down.
Plywood substitutes continue to be a bright spot in the forest industry: plants in Minnesota and Wisconsin are reportedly running at capacity.
Livestock raising enjoys a more positive outlook than crops. Higher beef prices have improved returns to ranchers and feeders, and cattle on feed numbers are up from a year earlier. Hog prices are up, reflecting smaller fall pig numbers.
Weather conditions are generally favorable for the 1993 crop season. There is good snow cover on virtually all fall-seeded crops such as winter wheat and rye, protecting these dormant crops from the cold, although plantings of those crops are down about 25 percent from a year earlier. Snowfalls are adequate to recharge reservoirs in western areas of the district.
