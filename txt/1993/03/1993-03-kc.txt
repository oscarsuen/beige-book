The harsh winter weather has slowed weight gains and swelled death losses in district feedlots. As a result, production costs have surged, and the supply of fed cattle available for sale is smaller than normal. The smaller supply of fed cattle has pushed up cattle prices to near record levels. But despite the higher prices, the surge in production costs has trimmed profits for district cattle feeders.
Year end credit reviews by agricultural lenders indicate that most farm borrowers entered 1993 in strong financial condition. Livestock producers last year recorded larger financial gains than crop producers. Lest year's record grain harvest pushed down grain prices and squeezed profit margins for district crop producers. But the lower grain prices reduced feed costs and bolstered profit margins for livestock producers. Overall, most borrowers made timely payments on their farm loans.
