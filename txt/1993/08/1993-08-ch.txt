Manufacturing contacts generally reported little change or moderate improvement in their own sales growth, but political and economic uncertainties were often identified as a weight on business activity more generally. An automaker confirmed its announced production schedules for the third quarter, which call for a significant increase over the same period last year. Another automaker anticipated a brisk increase in domestic sales in the 1994 model year. A large producer of auto pins reported increased aftermarket sales, with higher unit volume as well as modestly higher prices. Two electric utilities in Michigan reported further strengthening in industrial sales. A manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks reported a substantial increase in sales growth in June, and noted that industry sales reached their highest level for June since 1979. However, one heavy-duty truck producer expected industry output to flatten out (at relatively high levels) over the remainder of the year. An industry survey indicated that heavy-duty truck order backlogs remain firm, with buyers still requesting deliveries on time or ahead of schedule. A large manufacturer of business furniture systems expected a modest real gain in industry sales in 1993, but not so strong an increase as the recovery during 1992. This firm stated that the potential for sales to the financial services industry is relatively strong, following the improvement in profitability in the industry in recent years. A large chemical producer gave a mixed assessment of the prospects for earnings gains in the latter half of 1993, partly due to continued pricing weakness. Several firms noted significant. continuing weakness in European markets, with one stating that this weakness was leading it to hold domestic capital spending "a little closer to the vest."
Flooding continues to cause bottlenecks in the transportation network. Fortunately, water levels on the upper Mississippi have recently retreated, even falling below flood stage for most areas north of Davenport, Iowa. Several locks on this portion of the River have reopened, permitting local barge movements of grain, coal, and fertilizer. However, the long-haul barge shipments needed to help replenish grain stocks at the critical Gulf Port terminals still await the reopening of locks around the St. Louis area. Some observers believe it will take 10 days of no rain before commercial barge traffic in that area can resume.
