Flooding aside, other reports from District firms are mixed, with some experiencing modestly increased sales and others having flat or declining sales. Residential construction activity is strong in most areas of the District, as are new and existing home sales. Area banks for the most part were unaffected by recent flooding. While excessive rainfall and flooding have affected northern portions of the District, hot, dry weather is the norm in the southern reaches.
Public utilities in the affected areas report that service has been maintained, although in some cases a great deal of overtime has been employed to stay on top of service losses. Most major terminals and substations have been unaffected by the flooding. The total extent of flood damage at the household level, though, cannot be determined until flood waters recede and people return to their homes.
Retailers in the St. Louis area report sales, especially in apparel, as relatively flat compared with the same period last year. The riverfront has seen an increase in foot traffic, but no proportionate movement in purchases. Some are concerned that misinformation reported in the media about flooding in the St. Louis area could lead to a decline in retail sales in the coming weeks because potential tourists cannot distinguish between the city's flooded and non-flooded areas. Apparently the national attention has yet to affect the city's convention business, however.
Contacts in the iron, hydraulic parts and oil-extraction equipment industries report that sales are good and growing modestly. One contact emphasized international sales as being strong, especially from developing countries, while domestic sales are almost nonexistent. Many domestic firms, the contact reports, are postponing capital equipment expenditures until 1994. A contact from the heating and cooling industry reports that industry-wide sales have fallen dramatically and that inventories are growing.
According to a recent National Federation of Independent Businesses survey of District firms, about one-half of the respondents do not believe this is a good time to expand. One-fourth of the respondents felt conditions in the coming six months would be somewhat worse; however, one-fourth will increase employment this quarter.
According to the Army Corps of Engineers, the Port of St. Louis probably will not open until late August or early September. The closure of the upper Mississippi to barge traffic has led to only a slight increase in activity on the Ohio River, principally grain shipments. Flooding has also disrupted rail and trucking activities. A large District trucking firm reports that although shipments are off from one year ago, they are receiving some business they would not usually receive because of rail and barge disruptions.
