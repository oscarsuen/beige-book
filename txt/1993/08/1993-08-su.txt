Most Federal Reserve Districts reported that economic activity continued to expand slowly to moderately in June and the first half of July.

Kansas City and St. Louis reported that, in areas not affected by wet weather and flooding, crops were mostly in good condition and farmers were benefiting from higher grain prices.

In the Minneapolis District, above-normal precipitation has been a boon to cattle raisers, and pasture and range conditions in the Dakotas and Montana were said to be the best in many years.
Several Districts reported too much rain, too little rain, or both. Crop prospects are uncertain in many of these areas and will be determined by conditions between now and the frost.

San Francisco reported strong housing markets for most of the District, although southern California and western Washington were exceptions.
Commercial real estate activity remained sluggish or weak in most areas of the Atlanta, Dallas and Richmond Districts.
The Dallas, Kansas City and Atlanta Districts reported that higher natural gas prices have led to increased drilling, and a rise in activity for related service companies. Although drilling is generally expected to continue its upturn, Dallas respondents said that lower oil prices have clouded the drilling outlook for the second half of the year. In the San Francisco District, recent Alaskan oil discoveries were said to have improved the prospects for economic activity.
