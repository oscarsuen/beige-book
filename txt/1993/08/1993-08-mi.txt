Moderate growth continues to characterize the economy of the Ninth District in spite of adverse weather and flooding in many areas. Residential and commercial construction continues above 1992 levels and is perhaps the strongest component in the district economy. General merchandise and vehicle sales are also good except in areas where flooding has slowed retail spending. The tourist industry is generally strong in western portions of the district but somewhat slow in regions plagued by persistent rains. Price levels are stable with no indications of inflationary pressures while labor markets show modest improvements in employment levels. However crops, particularly soybeans and corn, have suffered extensive damage from heavy rains, flooding and cool weather, such losses are likely to exceed $1.5 billion.
Mining employment is stable while output is rising a bit. One western South Dakota gold mine is making a major investment to reach a new ore body. And an iron mining firm with operations in the Lake Superior region reported that its production and sales were higher than 1992 levels and above the firms own earlier projections for the 1993 season.
Non-farm employment is above year-earlier levels in all Ninth District states with most of the increase in services and trade employment. Unemployment rates declined in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. No large layoffs were reported.
But above-normal precipitation has been a boon to cattle raisers; pasture and range conditions in the Dakotas and Montana are reported to be the best in many years. Irrigation reservoir levels in western areas of the district are recovering from declines in preceding drought years. Meat prices, especially for beef, continue to be generally favorable.
