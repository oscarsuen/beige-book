Most sectors of the economy of the Second District made headway during June but there are a few preliminary indications of some retrenchment in July. June retail sales were reported "good" to "very good" with gains averaging 4 to 13 percent above year ago levels. Home builders reported generally fair-to-good housing starts although there was considerable variation within the region. Office leasing activity gained in most areas throughout the district and vacancy rates inched lower. The unemployment rate in New Jersey fell to 6.9 percent in June, from 7.4 percent in May, while in New York the unemployment rate rose from 7.5 percent to 7.8 percent. Early reports of economic activity in July, however, suggest some softening of the economy with a retreat in retail sales and housing.
Higher loan-to-value ratios with downpayments as low as 10-15 percent were a boost to New Jersey home sales but credit remained a difficult issue for many builders. The scarcity of acquisition and development loans is driving many builders out of the market; those who can borrow cite private lenders and pension funds as their sources, not banks. In addition, restructured projects from the Resolution Trust Corporation are viewed as a potential threat by many builders who feel that they cannot compete financially, and the potentially larger supply of RTC projects is viewed as particularly worrisome.
Commercial vacancy rates drifted lower in most areas throughout the region including Fairfield County, Northern New Jersey and Westchester, but the trends in Manhattan were mixed. Because employment growth remains negligible in most areas, the absorption rate for office space is slow. In addition, declining vacancy rates for primary space were also frequently associated with rising vacancy rates for secondary space.
