District auto dealers report that new and used domestic car sales are on the rise. Many dealers are optimistic and expect slow-to-moderate growth through the end of the year. Sales of Japanese cars, however, have declined because of rising prices and the perception of improved quality of domestic cars.
Other District areas are not as upbeat. For example, a shoe manufacturer reversed its decision about the fate of a western Tennessee plant and will close it in late July, eliminating 265 jobs. In addition, a children's clothing manufacturer in Tennessee will close its plant in early July, eliminating 300 jobs. A St. Louis-based defense contractor laid off an additional 132 workers.
