The First District economy continues to expand at a slow pace. Retailers, who had hoped that sales would improve once winter weather ended, express disappointment with results in late spring and early summer. Manufacturing contacts indicate that demand is flat to up modestly, and that inflation is not a major concern.
While the retail environment remains intensely promotional, prices and margins are stable. One exception is the price of lumber, which has declined following a price spike in the winter. Retailers are monitoring inventories carefully; none plan to add to current stocks.
Levels of permanent employment are generally unchanged, and summer seasonal hiring is limited. Wage increases are either nonexistent or limited to 3 percent. Among those contacted, capital spending plans are described as limited and focused on replacing equipment and remodeling stores. The few expansions under way are, for the most part, outside of New England.
Most contacts selling to the automotive industry report higher demand than a year ago. By contrast, contacts view the recovery in housing as disappointing or uneven, based on sales of housing-related products that generally are only slightly higher than in mid-1992. Sales of aircraft engines and parts typically are down sharply, but some contacts report rising exports to developing countries or stable demand from the Defense Department.
Although the U.K. economy is said to be in a modest recovery, declining demand in continental Europe is a source of heightened concern for First District manufacturers. A couple of contacts selling capital goods report strong sales to China and other Asian markets.
Manufacturing contacts report little or no inflation in sales and input prices. One manufacturer indicates that producers will "believe inflation when they see it," not when it is forecast by the bond market. Competitive pressures generally are reported as strong. Prices for a variety of capital goods -- including computer parts and building components -- are trending downward. Three manufacturers note that they have been able to raise prices only on products incorporating new features. One contact is paying higher prices for paper, and another has raised its prices for steel-based products.
Most contacts have reduced employment over the past year, by between 3 and 11 percent. The majority intend to continue to lower their U.S. head count. Increased demand for selected products is causing limited hiring or longer work hours, despite overall job cuts. This year's capital spending is projected to be flat to slightly down at most companies contacted.
Non-residential construction activity is slow, but in better shape than a year ago. Most new projects are in the health-care, education and public sectors. The large number of subcontractor failures has abated, and margins are now up a bit from a year ago.
