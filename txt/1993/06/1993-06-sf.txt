Auto sales are showing strength in certain markets. In the Puget Sound area, sales of domestic autos in May were reported up 8 percent over a year earlier and import sales were reported up 12 percent. Auto sales were also reported strong by contacts in Arizona, Idaho, and Utah.
Several contacts are reporting that uncertainty regarding federal tax and spending policies is delaying business investment and hiring plans. In Oregon, a contact reports that a number of projects expected to go into construction in the second half of the year are in jeopardy. The ongoing discussion regarding health care reform reportedly also is delaying investment in pharmaceutical and bio-tech industries. Finally, uncertainty regarding trade policy is of concern for importers, and also is reported to have delayed some investment decisions. Trade policy towards China (now temporarily resolved) is reported especially important to the Washington economy, where new airplane orders from Chinese airlines to Boeing in part have made up for cancellations from domestic airlines.
