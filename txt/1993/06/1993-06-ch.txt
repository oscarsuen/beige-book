Reports from individual manufacturers west mostly positive. After lagging the recovery in much of the District's industrial sector, several manufacturers of construction machinery increased their production plans in recent months. One of these firms cited increased economic activity, growth in corporate cash flow, and favorable financial conditions as leading to "an upbeat domestic environment for the first time in a long time." The turnaround in demand for this firm's products has been led by housing activity, but demand for equipment used in nonresidential construction recently began to improve as well. A manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks reported that orders continued to run at high levels, but stated that "there may be some chinks in the armor," noting modestly increased cancellation rates. This contact noted that recentstrengthening in medium-duty truck orders has been concentrated in leasing and rental firms. A heavy-duty truck industry analyst reported that production continued to rise on a seasonally adjusted basis during May. A large supplier to heavy-duty truck manufacturers reported that the pace of expansion in its own production has leveled off somewhat, but this contact also noted a recent pickup in orders from medium-duty truck manufacturers, a market that had been dormant for some time. A steel industry analyst reported that order books for integrated manufacturers are generally full into the fourth quarter, primarily due to strength in demand from auto and appliance producers, but also due to recent strengthening in construction and, to a lesser extent, agricultural machinery markets. A diversified manufacturer of heavy machinery stated that orders for its oilfield machinery and material handling equipment remained relatively weak. A manufacturer of plumbing products expressed some concern about recent trends in housing activity, but another producer reported that shipments of equipment linked to housing construction continued to run at good levels.
