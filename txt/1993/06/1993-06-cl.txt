Apparel sales have been slow to recover from their March decline, partly due to poor weather conditions during spring clothes sales and to consumer resistance to sharply increasing apparel prices. Instead of clothes, the popular items at department stores include hardware-type items and furniture and household goods.
Despite slower-than-expected sales earlier in the year, retail inventories are only slightly above desired levels. Clearance pricing of spring goods, especially apparel, has begun in earnest but is not expected to go beyond the usual discounting. Retailers believe that consumers will respond to clothing sales and that the overall retail market will continue a slow improvement. However, they are optimistic that the Midwest will outperform the national average.
Auto dealers report brisk sales in May, leading many to expect that a sustainable sales recovery is under way. Dealers attribute the increasing vehicle demand mostly to replacement or necessity buying. noting lagging sales of luxury models.
Steel producers indicate that their flat-rolled operations are at capacity. Although incoming orders have eased from the peak rate of the 1993:1Q, a major producer claims to be booked through the third quarter and anticipates a full order book for the balance of the year. Traditional capital goods producers generally expect output to grow at an even faster rate during the second half of the year than it did in the first half. The high rate of truck output has led to capacity constraints among the smaller suppliers in the industry. Auto production is up sharply in several Ohio facilities, which has led to additional shifts and more hiring. However, not all plants have shared in this revival. One production facility of mid-size cars reported output down more than 12% from a year ago. A producer of electronic parts reports a rising pace in orders and production across its markets, except for construction. On the other hand, a producer of aircraft parts posted a sizable decline in orders in April, primarily from defense and international customers, although orders year-to-date were still ahead of a year earlier.
Large manufacturers report no plans to hire additional workers, at least for the next several months. The major exception is steel producers, who have recalled employees recently. However, even the steel industry expects these gains to be offset by layoffs later in the year.
