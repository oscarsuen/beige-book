Most auto dealers report continuing strong sales over the past month. Financing is readily available for dealers and for creditworthy buyers. Most dealers are trimming their inventories of 1993 models and expect sales to remain strong for the remainder of the year.
Mortgage demand is strong but is expected to wane slightly as winter approaches. Mortgage rates have fallen further in recent weeks but respondents do not expect them to fall much more over the rest of the year.
None of the respondents changed their prime rate last month, and none expect to change it in the near term. A few banks lowered consumer lending rates, but most banks reported no change. Lending standards were unchanged.
Deposit flows of responding banks were also mixed last month. Half reported decreases in deposits, while half reported either no change or increases. Demand deposits and NOW accounts were constant to up at most responding banks. IRA and Keogh accounts, large CDs, and small time and savings deposits were constant to down at most responding banks.
The smaller-than-expected corn and soybean crops--key ingredients in livestock feed--have pushed up feed costs and trimmed profits somewhat for district cattle and hog producers. In response, some cattle feeders have reduced cattle inventories. The district's large-scale pork producers, however, maintain rigid production schedules that are unfazed by modest changes in feed costs.
Overall, despite the recent weather problems, prospects for farm income in the district remain healthy. While crop losses caused by wet weather and flooding will create financial hardship for many district farmers, higher crop prices will boost incomes for the majority who escaped the flooding and expect to harvest normal or near normal crops. Meanwhile, despite somewhat higher feed costs, strong cattle and hog prices continue to support solid earnings for most district livestock producers.
