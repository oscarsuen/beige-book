Car dealers report that sales of both new and used domestic cars are up, in many cases by more than 10 percent, over the same period last year. Import sales, especially of Japanese cars, however, continue to decline. Most dealers expect that as the model year changes and the usual year-end incentives are offered, sales over the next few months will continue their increase from one year ago. Dealers in Louisville, on the other hand, expect this year's total sales to be slightly lower than last year's because of the decline in import sales.
While a few reports from District firms not affected by the flooding are negative, most are upbeat. A mine in southeastern Illinois will close permanently by late September, eliminating 365 jobs. At the same time, another mine in southern Illinois reopened, calling back almost 350 workers from a layoff in March. A domestic airline announced that its corporate headquarters will move to St. Louis from New York. This relocation, along with one by a medical supply company from Chicago, will bring about 500 jobs into the area.
A contact in the oil-extraction equipment industry reports that, for the first time in about a year, orders from domestic firms have picked up. In Tennessee, a shirt manufacturer that closed in early July has reopened, calling back 350 employees, and a furniture manufacturer will open two new plants, creating 400 new jobs. A major telecommunications firm, which recently announced widespread reductions in its workforce, will close its Louisville office, affecting about 120 employees. Many of these employees will receive other positions within the company, although not necessarily in the District. In a July survey of District firms by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, only 13 percent believed that now is a good time to expand.
