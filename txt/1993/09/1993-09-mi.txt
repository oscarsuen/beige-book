The economy of the Ninth Federal Reserve District continues to grow moderately and economic conditions are, on balance, positive. Employment is growing in all district states, and two recently announced large layoffs appear to be the result of corporate restructuring rather than slack demand. On a sector-by-sector basis, construction is dearly quite strong and leads the economy. Manufacturing is improving, especially in small and mid-size firms. Mining output is generally stable, though a recent strike by iron miners has idled production in Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Agriculture is the one sector with declining output; crop production, especially in Minnesota and the Dakotas, will be down sharply from 1992 levels. Retail sales have apparently slowed somewhat in some parts of the district, but tourism appears stronger after an initially slow start. Price levels are stable, with no indication of inflationary pressures.
However, reflecting good crop conditions in areas not affected by flooding, soybean and corn prices have subsided from mid-July increases and are now respectively only 12 percent and 5 percent above pre-flooding levels and about even with year-ago levels.
In the livestock sector, cattle slaughter numbers and prices remain slightly above year-earlier levels. Hog prices are about 8 percent above year-ago levels and output is essentially the same. Milk production is down slightly in Wisconsin, but unchanged in Minnesota and other district states.
The tourism industry is having a good summer season. Montana and western South Dakota, which have been least affected by adverse weather, continue to have the most positive reports, while industry sources in Minnesota and Wisconsin report generally improved traffic after a slow start earlier in the summer.
