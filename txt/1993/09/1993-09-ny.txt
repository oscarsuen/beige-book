On balance, economic developments seemed slightly more positive in recent weeks, although some negative reports continued to be received. Sales results varied widely at District retail stores during July and early August Respondents reported no noteworthy change in homebuilding activity in recent weeks, and now expect housing starts to top last year's relatively low levels, though not by much. In the commercial real estate market the sale of a nearly vacant new office building in mid-Manhattan reportedly elicited more interest and sold for a higher price than many had expected. New York's unemployment rue decreased to 7.5 percent in July from 7.8 percent while New Jersey's rate held steady at 6.9 percent Most senior loan officers surveyed at small and midsized banks indicated no recent change in their willingness to lend.
Over-the-year sales changes ranged from -14 percent to +18 percent but despite several negative results, only one chain stated that inventories were somewhat worrisome. Stores were fairly evenly divided between those falling below and those exceeding plan. One chain with lower-than-expected results had moved a large promotional event from July to August and apparently underestimated the impact this would have on July sales. Several respondents were cautiously optimistic about the outlook, citing a continued lack of consumer confidence as the reason for their caution.
In the commercial real estate market the recent sale of a 42-story, nearly vacant new office building in mid-Manhattan reportedly elicited more interest and sold for a higher price than many had expected. The buyer, Morgan Stanley, noted that a number of its businesses have been growing and that the new building will fit in with its expansion plans. Some other financial services firms in Manhattan also have already increased or plan to increase their space when negotiating new leases.
The July surveys of purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester indicated some improvement among manufacturers in those areas. Rochester had a sizable increase in the percentage of firms stating that general business conditions were better 38 percent in July from 20 percent in June. A higher percentage of Buffalo firms reported a rise in output in July and, though the percentage with a gain in new orders fell, the percentage with the nine or increased new orders rose.
The District's employment outlook was dimmed by several announcements of future job reductions. The largest of these were IBM's planned cutback of another 35,000 and Kodak's additional downsizing of 10,000. Smaller cutbacks of 3000 and up to 1500 are in the offing for Johnson and Johnson and New York's Empire Blue Cross. Most of these numbers pertain to worldwide operations and no information is currently available as to the local impact. On a smaller scale, Martin Marietta will cut almost 500 Albany-area jobs and will decide by October whether to close any of several other plants in New York which it acquired in its recent purchase of GE's aerospace division.
