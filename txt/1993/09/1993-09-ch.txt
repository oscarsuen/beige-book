Bad weather and the effects of flooding restricted shipments of construction materials through July and early August. A gypsum wallboard producer expected industry shipments to rise somewhat less than earlier expected this year, but shipments to the Seventh District were still expected to post a modestly higher gain than in the nation as a whole. A large cement producer reported relative strength in shipments for light industrial construction, which combined with extensive public works activity to boost overall shipments in the absence of improvement in the weak commercial market. This contact stated that "we definitely see some better times ahead." A cement industry association stated that bad weather did not affect production, but shipments were delayed in some parts of the region.
