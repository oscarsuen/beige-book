On balance, the First District economy appears to be expanding only marginally. Retail sales are flat to down among contacts reached in late August. Manufacturing growth is uneven, and respondents report competitive price pressures even in relatively strong areas like automobiles and electronics. Commercial construction shows scattered improvement. Asset managers are experiencing higher sales.
Both costs and selling prices are largely unchanged. Retailers report that inventory levels generally are satisfactory, but, in the absence of sales advances, they are monitoring their stocks closely.
Most retail contacts intend to renovate some stores or upgrade equipment, and a minority plan to expand their locations. Employment is increasing only to staff new locations. Looking forward, contacts express concern that economic progress may have stalled.
Almost all contacts cite downward pressure on prices. The majority, including those in strong markets, indicate that their selling prices are flat. Medical equipment suppliers have reduced their prices, by as much as 15 percent. Materials costs are flat or up just slightly. A growing number of contacts indicate that they are pressing suppliers to reduce prices-with some success where markets are competitive. By exception, lumber prices have reportedly risen by about 20 percent over the past year, and one contact anticipates a double-digit increase in the price of steel after a three-year freeze.
Employment has risen substantially at two contacts over the past year, but most report declines in the range of 1 to 10 percent. The majority expect the size of their work forces to remain steady in coming months, although some are continuing to reduce their numbers through attrition or layoffs. One manufacturer of auto parts intends to hire additional workers, and two other contacts mentioned the possibility of increasing overtime if demand continues to improve. Capital spending remains concentrated on modernization and automation, but about one-third of this month's contacts intend to expand capacity.
Most manufacturers feel that the economy at large will provide very little help to their business over the coming year. Over half mentioned higher federal taxes as a negative factor, and some voice concern about uncertainties resulting from pending health care reform.
