Economic developments seemed slightly more positive in recent weeks. A majority of District retail respondents reported that October sales were on or above plan. Homebuilders noted little change in the residential construction market in recent weeks though a few saw signs of some increased buyer interest.  Office vacancy rates moved lower in downtown Manhattan, and some analysts believe that, if the trend continues, this could be the first year since the mid-80s that a net absorption of commercial space occurred downtown. The latest nonfarm employment figures showed some improvement in the region, but the state unemployment rates continued to be quite volatile. Looking to the future, most of our manufacturing contacts expect sales to increase over the next six months, and virtually all reported intense price competition. Most senior loan officers at small and midsized banks indicated no change in their willingness to lend over the last quarter though a few mentioned an increased willingness.
Over-the-year sales results ranged widely in October, from -6.8 percent to +13 percent. Retailers reported varying experience even with comparable product lines. For example, some retailers noted strong demand for most kinds of apparel, but weakness in items for the home, while others reported opposite trends and attributed weak fall apparel sales to unusually warm weather. As compared with the relatively strong gains last year, they anticipate somewhat smaller year-to-year increases this Christmas. With one exception, all respondents stated that inventories were in good shape going into the holiday season, with some describing them as "lean".
Office vacancy rates moved lower in downtown Manhattan, and some analysts noted that if the trend continues, this could be the first year since the mid-80s that net absorption of commercial space occurred in the downtown area. Vacancy rates rose somewhat in mid-Manhattan, however, as several firms added small amounts of excess office space to the supply.
Most of our manufacturing contacts expect sales to increase over the next six months, with several projecting gains of 5 percent or more. Most firms report intense price competition, and anticipate flat-to-lower prices. Those planning price increases generally acknowledge that they are not sure they can make the prices stick. The majority of the firms expect capital spending in the next six months to equal or exceed spending in the first half of 1993, and most expect wage gains to be moderate and less than in 1993.
