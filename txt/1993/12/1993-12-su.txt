Most Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity continued to expand at a moderate pace through the end of November and reports were generally more optimistic than those of this summer. Consumer spending improved in a majority of Districts, with sales of autos and other durable goods said to again show relative strength. Retailers in several Districts reported that the holiday shopping season got off to a good start over the long Thanksgiving weekend with sales at or exceeding expectations. Manufacturing activity also was seen as improving in most Districts, but few businesses reported new hiring. Residential real estate markets were once again noted as a source of strength in most District economies, while commercial real estate markets have begun to show a few signs of improvement. Wage increases and prices for final goods generally were said to be stable, although several Districts reported that prices for lumber and other building materials have risen since October. Commentary on conditions in three Districts--Boston, New York, and San Francisco--was more mixed, with particular weakness indicated in reports from California.
Dealers in most Districts noted moderate year-over-year increases in auto and truck sales in October and November. Those in the Dallas and St. Louis Districts reported that trucks and minivans were selling the fastest, while leasing activity picked up in Cleveland. At the same time, low inventories of new model year vehicles were said to be constraining sales in parts of the Chicago, San Francisco, and St. Louis Districts, although in Chicago most shortages had been alleviated by November.
Although business conditions are seen as improved in many industries, employment gains remain muted, with continued reports of defense and aerospace cutbacks. Manufacturers in the Atlanta District said that employment has been flat, while those in the Cleveland District noted that small firms also were not adding new employees. Reports from manufacturers in California indicate continued sluggishness. Businesses in the Atlanta, San Francisco, and St. Louis Districts cited new layoffs prompted by cutbacks in defense and NASA programs, while manufacturers of aircraft parts and defense-related equipment in the Boston District have continued to experience sales declines. Employers in the apparel industry in the Atlanta and Boston Districts also reported decreases in employment. Weak demand from foreign customers was said to be a source of concern to producers in the Boston and Cleveland Districts.
Reports from commercial real estate markets were more mixed. Contacts in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts said that office and commercial vacancy rates remain at relatively high levels, although those in New York noted some improvement in downtown Manhattan. For Richmond, some improvement was seen in commercial leasing activity, as well as in office vacancy rates, but not enough to stimulate new building. In the Atlanta, Dallas, and Minneapolis Districts, however, construction of new retail space is said to reflect an improvement in commercial real estate markets.
Recent weather conditions are said to have been favorable for agriculture in much of the country. In the Richmond District, the warm, dry weather has allowed fall planting activity to progress ahead of schedule. The recently planted winter wheat crop in the Kansas City District was reported to be in good condition.
Reports on mining activity were mixed. Kansas City reported that drilling activity was seen as steady to improved in all Tenth District states except New Mexico. Dallas, however, reported that rig counts had been falling in response to weak oil prices and a recent dip in natural gas prices. Miners in the Minneapolis District reported that strong gold prices were encouraging activity in South Dakota and Montana, but that low aluminum prices and higher electricity costs might begin to curb aluminum mining in Montana.
