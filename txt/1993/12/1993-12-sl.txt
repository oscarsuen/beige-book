Car sales throughout the District continue to show strength. Many dealers report 10 percent increases over the same period last year, with some in Memphis reporting slightly stronger growth. Trucks and minivans continue to sell very well. Louisville continues to experience extremely strong sales in both foreign and domestic models. Inventory shortages, however, have cut into the sales volume of newer models. Overall, a strong fourth quarter is expected.
Firms are also experiencing strong orders and shrinking inventories. One contact in the tractor industry claims that inventories are at a 35-year low, owing partly to few suppliers remaining in the industry, one of which is undergoing a major reorganization. A firm in the air conditioning and heating industry reports that business has unexpectedly rebounded, after a downturn early in the third quarter. Orders to medical suppliers are booming according to a contact at a regional health center. Most firms expect slight increases in employment within the next month or two.
Two District areas of particular strength are northwest Arkansas (Benton and Washington counties) and northwest Mississippi (Tunica County). In northwest Arkansas, the regional unemployment rate has fallen more than 1 percentage point over the past year, and new home construction is booming. In northwest Mississippi, riverboat gambling has turned one of the nation's historically poorest counties into one of its fastest growing. A third casino is scheduled to open in December, and four more are under construction. More than $1 billion in construction has occurred in the area in 1993. Area firms are having difficulty finding workers because of the boom. Monthly sales in the county during the third quarter were almost double last year's sales.
Layoffs at some firms temper the generally positive news. In northeast Mississippi, for example, the cancellation of a NASA contract eliminated 1,900 construction jobs and 1,500 other jobs that would have been created had the facility been completed. A public utility in Kentucky plans to lay off almost 300 unionized workers because there is not enough work. An oil company will cut almost 150 jobs to reduce costs.
