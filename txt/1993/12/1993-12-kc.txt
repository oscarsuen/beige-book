Automobile sales increased last month and most dealers are optimistic about future sales. Financing is readily available for dealer inventories and potential buyers. Dealers are expanding inventories with 1994 models.
No respondents changed their prime rates last month, and no changes are expected in the near term. Most respondents lowered consumer lending rates over the past month through special promotions. About half the survey respondents expect to raise these rates soon by concluding the promotions, while the rest expect no change in the near term. Lending standards at all banks were unchanged.
Deposits increased at almost all responding banks last month. Deposit growth was concentrated in demand, NOW, and money market deposit accounts. IRA and Keogh accounts were mostly unchanged, while large CDs and small time and savings deposits were flat to down slightly.
Despite the crop losses, district bankers expect little increase in problem farm loans. Crop prices have risen to ration smaller crop supplies, lessening the sting of crop losses for many farm borrowers and boosting incomes for others who harvest normal or near normal crops. In addition, government disaster assistance and sales of grain stored from previous harvests will help cushion the blow of crop losses for many district farmers.
Higher crop prices also are likely to push up feed costs and trim profits in the district livestock industry, the dominant source of farm income strength in recent years. District bankers report that higher feed costs are encouraging some cattle and hog producers to scale back their production plans in spite of relatively strong cattle and hog prices. Overall, district farm income should nearly match last year's relatively healthy level, despite a harsh year for some district farmers.
