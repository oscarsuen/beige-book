Surveys and reports from retailers indicated that retail sales and traffic generally met or exceeded expectations over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, despite difficult weather around much of the District. For example, a large department store chain stated that "we were very pleased" with sales over the weekend, with sales exceeding projections. A check authorization firm reported a 5 percent year-over-year increase in day-after-Thanksgiving sales in the Chicago area.
Our latest survey of agricultural bankers found that District farmland values were stable this summer, in general, and up about 3 percent from a year ago. The bankers' views on credit conditions varied widely, however, with most of the difference seemingly tied to the extent of crop damage from the summer floods. Bankers in the harder-hit states of Iowa and Wisconsin are concerned about farm earnings and loan repayment rates, while bankers elsewhere in the District generally expect earnings and loan repayment rates to match or exceed year-earlier levels.
