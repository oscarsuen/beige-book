Conditions in service-raised industries are mixed. Potential health care reform is reported to be leading to consolidation among health care providers. Contacts indicate that law and accounting firms are reducing overhead through early retirement. In California, passage of a sale tax extension is expected to assist local government in the short run. A recent voter initiative in Washington is likely to limit state government spending and lead to restructuring in the next year. In contrast, fiscal conditions are good in state and local governments in Utah and Idaho.
Other manufacturing industries show signs of improvement. Some types of cable television distribution equipment is reported in short supply, with some larger companies having bought out the complete stocks of some suppliers. Sales by western food processors of peas, corn, beans, and pumpkins are reported very strong due to a shortfall from the Midwest.
