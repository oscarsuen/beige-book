Economic activity in the Third District remained on a modest upward trend in November, according to reports from the region's business community. Manufacturers noted gains in shipments and orders, although they indicated employment was only steady. Retailers generally said they were posting slight gains from a year ago, and auto dealers said that sales, while off slightly in recent weeks, were still running at a healthy pace. Bankers indicated that overall lending was up slightly, due mainly to growing consumer loan volume. Residential real estate activity had picked up, according to realtors, but demand for commercial real estate was stagnant.
Most business contacts in the Third District forecast a continuation of current trends. Manufacturers expect orders and sales to continue growing, and they are planning increases in capital spending. Retailers forecast year-over-year sales increases of 3 to 5 percent, in dollar terms, for the Christmas season. Bankers expect a seasonal increase in consumer borrowing, but, in general, they expect commercial and industrial lending to edge up very slightly, at best. Realtors and home builders believe the stepped-up pace of home sales will persist for at least another six months.
Looking ahead, just over half of the area manufacturers contacted for this report expect continued improvement over the next six months. They forecast parallel increases in orders and shipments, and nearly half plan to boost capital spending. On balance, comments from manufacturers indicate that overall employment may edge up somewhat during the winter.
Auto dealers generally said sales in November had slipped a bit from October but were running at a good pace. They said new models were being well received, and they expect to close the year on a healthy sales trend.
Bankers expect consumer borrowing to increase seasonally, but they do not anticipate much growth in commercial and industrial lending. They also expect refinancing activity to taper off.
Commercial real estate activity remains flat, according to brokers and property managers. Office vacancy rates in the region have changed little from a year ago according to some brokers' surveys, and demand for retail space was still described as soft. Some pickup in demand for industrial space was noted, however.
Some positive developments have been noted in regional construction activity. In addition to increased residential building, some utility and other nonresidential projects have gotten under way. Overall, however, the gain in construction activity is slight.
