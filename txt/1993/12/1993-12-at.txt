While still slow when compared to the 1980s, multifamily and commercial real estate markets have continued to show signs of steady improvement. Vacancy rates for both office and industrial space have continued to edge downward while effective rental rates have climbed. In the last few months a relatively large number of new retail, commercial, and public building projects were announced across the District, along with several new multifamily residential developments. Nevertheless, most contacts do not expect to see an increase in speculative building for at least another year.
