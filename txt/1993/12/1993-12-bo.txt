Gradual economic expansion continues in the First District. Many regional retailers report their sales gains have been constrained by competition, although some specialty and outlet stores are doing well. Some New England manufacturers report strong growth; manufacturers serving a few industries report a falloff in sales. Commercial real estate markets continue to improve in Boston and northern New England, but no turnaround is visible in Hartford. Mutual funds' assets under management continue to grow.
New England retail contacts foresee a tough, competitive holiday season. All are going "all out" to attract shoppers, offering coupon promotions, longer store hours, and large discounts beginning in mid-November. Nonetheless, a majority expect only 2 to 3 percent sales growth in December versus a year earlier, far less than in 1992. Merchants also are cautious in their outlook for 1994, and they fear that fierce competition will force some department stores out of business. In response, they are keeping capital spending at a minimum.
Several contacts indicate that the Midwest and Southeast states are showing the best sales performance, but that New England markets are recovering. European demand is described as generally weak.
Several consumer goods manufacturers have raised prices 1 to 4 percent, while a few capital goods manufacturers have been forced to lower prices. Otherwise, selling prices are described as flat. Cost pressures remain minimal, except for lumber prices and some modest increases attributable to appreciation of the yen.
About one-quarter of this month's contacts report a significant reduction in employment over the past year, while three-quarters indicate little change. Manufacturers anticipating increases in sales volume are planning zero or only modest additions to their work force, as they intend to increase efficiency.
Most contacts expect the economic environment in 1994 to remain unchanged or to improve moderately. Some indicate that their forecast is predicated on maintaining consumer confidence or reasonably low interest rates. Several note that their company's prospects depend in part on introducing innovative products.
Venture capital firms report that among firms in their investment portfolios, telecommunications system and capital equipment firms are experiencing stronger sales in the fourth quarter than earlier in the year, while software firms' sales are flat.
