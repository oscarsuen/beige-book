Somewhat stronger conditions are reported in most other District markets, with consumer confidence noticeably more robust than in California. Contacts report stable or strengthening conditions in Idaho, Utah, and Oregon. In Idaho, for example, new vehicle registrations during March were up 26 percent over a year earlier. In Washington, however, consumer confidence is reported down due to aerospace cutbacks, adversely affecting retail trade and sales. A contact in the Washington legal industry also reports weak conditions. A contact in eastern Washington, however, reports that the region is benefiting from increased federal spending on nuclear cleanup projects.
Stronger conditions exist in other sectors. A contact from Silicon Valley reports that orders are strong in several segments of the electronics industry, although there are signs that the peak in growth rates may be past. Contacts from Idaho and Utah report both strong demand and tightening inventories for heavy and construction equipment. No major delivery problems are reported, however.
The residential sector is showing more strength. Home building in southern Arizona is reported very strong, in part due to the shift of aerospace jobs from southern California to Tucson. Contacts also report that Utah and Idaho are experiencing a continued boom in residential construction and sales. Some shortage of lumber and construction labor is noted. In California, contacts report some pick up in real estate activity due to lower interest rates and decreased home prices.
