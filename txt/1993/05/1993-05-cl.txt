Producers of truck components also report near-capacity operations, as new orders in March again exceeded expectations. Backlogs continue to climb rapidly, and heavy-duty truck production for 1993 now appears to be running at a rate close to the previous peak year in 1988. Stronger-than-expected demand for some automobile and light truck models and options has strained capacity and created bottlenecks at a few Big Three parts and assembly plants.
Producers of capital goods and special industrial and telecommunications equipment also cite better-than-expected orders and backlogs last quarter. For example, a manufacturer of equipment for depository institutions reports sizable increases in orders so far this year relative to last year, resulting in an additional shift at one plant. Some consumer goods producers also note a step-up in sales and production since late 1992. Sales of vacuum cleaners rose at a double-digit rate last quarter, and output of major household appliances held at about the previous quarter's level. For machine tools, however, orders continue on an irregularly rising trend because of further weakness in the aerospace and commercial aircraft industries.
Retailers expect only replacement hiring at this time, as they anticipate increased productivity and overtime hours to accommodate sales growth in the near term.
Several large banks state that savings deposits, especially certificates of deposit, fell sharply again in April, with some indicating a bigger decline than in March. A few large and mid-sized thrift institutions, however, report that aggressive pricing and marketing programs have generated growth in their deposits in April.
