Economic developments in the Second District were mixed in recent weeks, but on balance tended toward improvement. Plagued by severe snowstorms, most retail contacts reported sales results below plan during February and March, though some were able to recoup much of their shortfall during the final weeks of March. New York's unemployment rate declined in February and March while New Jersey's rate rose. Office leasing activity varied widely with some vacancy rates declining and others increasing. Homebuilders in most of the District reported some recent improvement and anticipate that home sales will surpass last year's level. In its first assessment of the local economic impact of the World Trade Center bombing, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey estimated that the net short-term effect would be a small, positive one due to the increase in jobs for reconstruction and cleanup work financed by national insurers. Personal income tax receipts in both New York and New Jersey continued to show sizable over-the-year gains. The latest survey of small and midsized banks showed an increase in their willingness to make loans.
The cold and stormy weather reportedly put a damper on sales of adult spring apparel at several stores, but sales of children's clothes for Easter did well. Furniture and home appliances sold well at some chains and retailers are hopeful that warmer weather will spur apparel sales in the weeks ahead. Despite some recent inventory buildup resulting from below-plan sales, the majority of contacts reported no significant inventory problems. However, a few stated that additional promotional efforts may be needed to pare stocks.
Developments in the District's office market have been mixed. Leasing activity was reportedly brisk in midtown Manhattan where, despite some additions to space, the vacancy rate edged down. While activity in downtown Manhattan remained subdued, the area has managed to absorb some of its vacant space in recent months and the primary vacancy rate has begun to decline. The vacancy rate has risen sharply in Westchester County, however, due in part to the addition of large blocks of space created by IBM's downsizing.
In its first assessment of the local economic impact of the World Trade Center bombing, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey estimated that the net short-term effect would be a small, positive one. Since almost all of the damage to businesses was insured, the reconstruction and cleanup effort was largely financed from outside the region but provided jobs for people living here. The long-term effect could be different, however, if insurance premiums rise, revenue is lost because the Center decides to restrict public access to certain facilities and/or the prestige of the Center is reduced as a result of the bombing.
Surveyed bankers indicated that the recent policy change requiring less documentation on "character" loans by healthy banks has not affected their lending to small businesses. Moreover, their reactions to proposals to create a secondary market for business loans were mixed. Several officers mentioned that securitization often results in the loss of relationships with the community, which are essential to small business lending. Also cited as a potential hindrance was the customized and unique nature of small business loans, which renders them difficult to securitize. However, increased liquidity and reduced risk might encourage more small business lending. Several officers suggest that the expansion of Small Business Administration programs would be the best vehicle for stimulating small business loans.
