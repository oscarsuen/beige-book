Manufacturers were optimistic about their prospects for the next six months. Increases were expected in almost all indicators except inventories and the number of employees, which were both expected to be steady.
Cost-conscious consumers and high lumber prices were squeezing manufacturers' profit margins. Three reasons were cited for high lumber prices: (1) recent weather has hindered timbering; (2) competition in the lumber industry has lessened as regulations have forced small mills out of business; and (3) environmental restrictions have reduced the availability of timber, despite increases in forest areas and volume.
Retailers were optimistic about their prospects for the next six months. They expected sales, shopper traffic, wages, prices, and inventories to increase. They foresaw no change in employment or capital expenditures.
Residential mortgage demand strengthened during the last six weeks. Application volume was at a record-high level in March, but fell off in April. Home mortgage loan rates were, on net, little changed during the period. Rates bottomed out in early March, rose during the next few weeks, and began to decline again in April. Activity was about evenly divided between originations and refinancings.
Prices of existing homes remained mostly steady, but prices of new homes rose because of higher lumber costs. In areas where the residential market was strongest, higher costs were almost entirely borne by homebuyers. In other areas, however, the result was lower profit margins for builders.
Some new construction was underway, particularly for large, anchored shopping centers and government buildings. Little speculative construction was underway, but some analysts noted that a few builders were beginning construction with only 80 to 90 percent of the building preleased. Other analysts reported that a shortage of large blocks of office space would stimulate construction demand in the future.
