The economy of the Ninth District is growing moderately. Consumer spending on merchandise, automobiles and new homes continues to grow and provide impetus for the economy. Moreover, other indicators signal that the recovery is firming. Commercial and heavy construction is reviving, with substantial state and local government projects slated for some areas. Recent indicators suggest some growth in manufacturing. In agriculture, cattle and hog numbers continue to rise in response to very favorable feed and slaughter prices. While current mining output is unchanged, industry officials predict an improved year for iron mining and profitability has improved for gold producers. Oil industry prospects ate positive for the first time in years. Cold, wet weather is severely delaying grain planting but has helped ensure that soil moisture levels are adequate across virtually all of the Ninth District. However, labor markets show slight growth in total employment coupled with steady to slightly higher unemployment rates.
Spending on general merchandise apparently continued at levels 3 to 5 percent above year earlier levels for the month of March and for the first quarter of 1993. A major Minneapolis-based general retailer characterized its March same-store sales, up 3.6 percent from a year earlier, as "disappointing" in comparison to increases achieved in January and February. However, such levels seem typical for much of the district. Advisory council members, Ninth District directors and newspapers generally also report good retail sales conditions but no spectacular growth. And the Minnesota Department of Revenue announced that sales tax receipts through the first quarter were above projections.
New single-family bowing permits in February for Minneapolis-St. Paul remained below year-earlier levels but rose after declines the previous two months. And industry spokespersons across the district continue to describe residential construction as strong. A Minneapolis area builder's association representative characterized sales as "very strong" and a newspaper noted a building boom in the Sioux Falls. S.D., area. A district director from western South Dakota described the housing market in the Rapid City area as "very tight', noting that many new single-family residences were planned.
One high producing new oil well was completed near Dickinson. N.D. Ninth District directors from North Dakota and Montana report that oil companies show renewed interest in leasing and exploration and believe that with tight cost control, new production wells can be profitable at current oil price levels. Drilling rig counts for April are approximately equal to the same period in 1992.
The crop sector is still emerging from winter inactivity. Grain prices in mid-April are largely unchanged since February with the exception of an increase in the corn price. Unusually cool, wet weather has delayed field preparation and crop planting in all district states and for all major crops. Soil moisture levels are adequate to surplus across virtually all agricultural regions.
In spite of positive developments in the general economy noted above, such weakness in labor markets may continue due so ongoing processes of corporate restructuring and military downsizing that continue to affect the Ninth District. A large computer manufacturer announced that 700 full-time and 1,200 part-time or temporary workers will be laid off at its Rochester, Minn., plant out of a total of some 7,600 workers. And the Department of Defense announced that K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base, located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, was on its list of facilities slated for closing. Sawyer AFB, with 3,300 military and 1,000 civilian personnel, is a major factor in Upper Peninsula employment and spending.
