Row crop producers have made little planting progress due to an unusually wet spring. Muddy conditions continue to keep farmers out of their fields as frequent showers and cool temperatures have prevented adequate drying. Most of the fieldwork that has been completed was done last fall.
Feedlot conditions have improved since winter storms pounded much of the district. Although feedlots are not operating at capacity, they are generally as full as operators want them. With fed cattle prices hovering around $82, feedlot managers are marketing cattle as quickly as they can. Poor weight gains and death loss due to the winter storms, however, still hamper efforts to maintain steady marketings.
The volume of farm real estate sales in most parts of the district remained steady over the past year, while land values edged up. According to district agricultural lenders, farm real estate values have advanced 3 to 4 percent in the past year. The cash rental value of farmland, however, has fluctuated little from 1992.
