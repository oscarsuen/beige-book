Reports from other areas of the District are also positive. For example, a Tennessee plant producing shoes with a workforce of 260, originally slated to close, will remain open indefinitely because of unexpected increases in demand. This is the second time this year the company has reversed its plans to close one of its plants because of unexpected growth in demand. In March, a steel foundry in Illinois reopened after 18 mouths with 330 recalled employees. The firm also reports that up to 1,000 additional workers may be hired soon to meet the expected demand. A poultry processor in western Kentucky is undergoing a major expansion that will lead to 300 new jobs.
Some employment reductions did occur, however. A Tennessee producer of children's clothing reports that reduced sales and internal efficiency concerns will cause it to close a plant by June, eliminating about 300 jobs. In Memphis, a maker of food products will release up to two-thirds of its current 350 employees as it stops production of bulk products for other food companies. Because of a reorganization, a national computer company will lay off about 200 of its 550 workers in St. Louis.
