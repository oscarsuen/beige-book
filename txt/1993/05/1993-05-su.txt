Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts indicate generally modest improvement in economic conditions across much of the nation. Shopper traffic and retail sales were reported to have rebounded modestly in April, following general declines in March resulting in part from severe weather. Manufacturers in most districts report increases in shipments and orders, with near-capacity production at some automotive and steel facilities. Higher production schedules are being met through productivity gains and overtime, although some districts have reported new hires. Residential real estate activity in most districts is strong or on the rise, and pockets of improvement in commercial office markets are noted by some districts. The general increase in lending continues to be concentrated in consumer loans and mortgage refinancing, with some reports of pickup in small business borrowing. District reports show generally stable prices, except for increases in steel and energy.
A general pickup in the sale of autos and light trucks in the first half of April is also reported in most districts. Dealers in the Cleveland, Dallas, and Philadelphia districts note that domestically produced models are selling at a faster pace than foreign-produced ones. Also, most dealers remain optimistic that the improved trend will continue in the near term, and they are satisfied that inventories are at manageable levels.
Retailers generally report stable prices on most items, citing stiff competition, consumer sensitivity to price hikes, and slower sales growth. Merchants contacted by Dallas and Kansas City indicate that prices are stable or slightly lower compared to a year ago, and that they expect prices to remain stable over the near term. Richmond contacts, on the other hand, cite an upward trend in retail prices.
Several districts, including Richmond and San Francisco, note a decline in tourism compared to a year ago. Resorts and hotels surveyed by Richmond indicate that the number of visitors is down from last year and that tourists are spending less. Hotel and convention industry representatives contacted by San Francisco characterize the Southern California visitor industry as depressed. At the same time, Atlanta reports a strong spring tourism season, with air passenger traffic, convention attendance, and the number of spring-break visitors to Florida higher than a year ago.
With the exception of steel price increases noted by Cleveland and Kansas City, most districts report constant or only slightly higher input prices compared to a year ago. Manufacturers surveyed by Atlanta comment that competition continues to hold prices of intermediate materials and final goods stable. Dallas respondents indicate flat to slightly failing prices in chemicals, plastics, petrochemicals, and electrical and electronic machinery, and San Francisco contacts add that aluminum prices are also soft. However, purchasing managers surveyed by Chicago note a somewhat faster rate of price increases as demand improves in that region.
Atlanta and San Francisco report that cutbacks in the aerospace and defense industries continue to dampen manufacturing activity. San Francisco respondents indicate that Boeing continues to lay off workers, although they anticipate that increased orders from foreign carriers may partially offset the weak demand from domestic airlines. Dallas notes that low levels of nonresidential construction and oil and gas drilling have contributed to lower production among the firms they contacted. Firms contacted by Kansas City report operating below capacity, in part because of decreased foreign sales.
The commercial real estate market remains weak in most districts, except for isolated pockets of increased activity. Contacts in Minneapolis report that commercial contract awards are up significantly from a year ago. Realtors in New York note brisk leasing of commercial office space in midtown Manhattan but subdued activity in downtown Manhattan and in a few immediate suburbs. Richmond's survey finds strong commercial activity in the Carolinas and in Richmond, but weak conditions in Maryland and in the District of Columbia.
A few districts, including Atlanta, Kansas City, and St. Louis, note a pickup in commercial loans, particularly to small businesses. Some bankers surveyed by Cleveland cite a strong demand by businesses to refinance existing loans. Many respondents across the country report that deposit growth is steady, attributable in part to aggressive pricing and marketing programs. Bankers from several districts describe loan markets as very competitive and state that more aggressive pricing has decreased net interest margins A few bankers contacted by St Louis have expressed concern that narrow margins have contributed to slow deposit growth in their region.
Minneapolis reports increased shipments of iron ore and stable conditions in copper mining despite low copper prices. Dallas and Kansas City report seasonally low domestic oil drilling. OPEC production cutbacks and blizzard-related consumption hikes are expected to keep oil and natural gas storage levels low and prices on the high side for several months.
