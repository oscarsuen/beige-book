Economic conditions in the First District continue to improve gradually. While retail sales results are mixed, demand for manufactured goods has risen from a year ago, and residential real estate sales volume is up. Inflation reportedly remains low because of competitive pressures and soft input prices.
Established retailers express concern over the changing competitive landscape, as large discount stores step into the New England market, attracted by the availability of space and less prohibitive costs in the region's malls. The increased competition has put downward pressure on prices, margins, and profits. Employment levels are relatively stable and wage increases are said to be modest.
Seeing the market as unpredictable, most retailers describe their capital spending plans as limited. Holiday sales growth this year is expected to range from 0 to 10 percent-not as robust as last year.
Widespread competitive pressures and soft prices for inputs including petrochemicals, photochemicals, and copper are responsible for a low inflation environment for most manufacturers. Contacts report that automakers are demanding yearly price decreases from suppliers. Several respondents indicate that the paper industry is trying to raise prices 2 to 7 percent, but they expressed some doubt about whether the increases would stick.
Over the past year, most manufacturing contacts report employment changes in the range of -3 to +5 percent. Some large companies have implemented sharper reductions. Looking ahead, just over one-half of the manufacturing respondents plan to maintain or slightly increase the size of their work force. Companies that have experienced sizable employment cutbacks foresee a diminished rate of shrinkage.
Close to one-half of First District manufacturing contacts plan to maintain a constant level of capital spending over the next year. A similar number intend to increase investment, in response to rising demand for automotive or other products, or to improve efficiency. Same respondents will allow capital spending to taper off, after a large increase in 1993.
Although prices, after accounting for the mix of properties, were mostly flat, a couple of contacts noted that prices in particularly desirable suburbs of Boston seem to be rising. Connecticut home prices, while still falling, are expected to bottom out within two quarters.
