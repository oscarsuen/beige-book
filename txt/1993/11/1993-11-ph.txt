Business conditions in the Third District appeared to improve modestly in September and early October, according to reports from businesses in the region. Manufacturers noted gains in new orders and shipments as well as increased hiring. Retailers generally said that sales were running slightly above the year-ago pace. Bankers indicated that total lending was edging up, due mainly to an increase in loans to consumers.
Looking ahead, manufacturers expect further gains in shipments and orders, and they plan to step up hiring and increase capital spending over the next six months. Retailers generally forecast just a slight increase in sales for the coming Christmas shopping period compared to last year, and they report they have placed orders for seasonal merchandise accordingly. The outlook among bankers contacted for this report is positive but restrained. On balance, they expect moderate growth in overall economic activity and lending.
For the near future, about half of the surveyed firms anticipate continuing gains in orders and shipments, and less than one-in-ten expect business conditions to worsen. In line with this generally optimistic outlook, more than one-quarter of the companies queried said they plan to add workers and increase capital spending over the next six months.
In general, area merchants are cautious in their forecasts for the upcoming Christmas sales period. While they expect sales to be above last year's levels, they indicate that they have exercised restraint in ordering merchandise for the season.
Based on comments from bankers, it appears that commercial and industrial lending ranged from flat to up very slightly. Several noted that small business lending and lending to middle market companies were showing some signs of improvement. Nevertheless, most said corporate borrowers were continuing to reduce debt and appeared to be planing further downsizing of their operations.
The balance of opinion among bankers contacted for this report is that total lending will continue to move up gradually in tandem with overall economic activity. They expect business borrowing to grow slowly, at best, held back by continuing restructuring among larger firms. They anticipate that the current upward trend in consumer lending will be maintained unless economic growth slips from its current pace.
