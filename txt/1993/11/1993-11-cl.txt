Although capacity is generally adequate, a few manufacturers report rising backlogs and capacity strains in some specific areas. However, among the sources we contacted, there is still considerable uneasiness concerning business prospects in 1994. Pricing remains competitive and profit margins are reportedly lean. While area business contacts report a need to add workers in some skilled positions, there is still some apprehension concerning long-term commitments to newly hired labor. Moreover, inventories are being managed cautiously at both the manufacturing and retail level.
Small business contacts round the District, like elsewhere in the county, are reporting mixed signals. Certain manufacturing and retail establishments indicate that sales are merely holding even or are even declining in some instances. Others are enthusiastic about recent orders and sales strength although few expect to expand payrolls significantly. The emergence of foreign markets has affected the region's small manufacturing businesses. Several firms indicated that a significant and growing source of sales revenue was either directly or indirectly tied to foreign demand.
Most domestic dealers are encouraged by their current sales pace and are increasingly confident that a sustainable recovery is under way. They are not being quite as conservative in their ordering patterns as earlier in the year, and are increasing orders significantly for many popular models.
Retailers, although fairly optimistic about the 1993 holiday season, do not expect the dramatic rise in spending that occurred last Christmas. Orders have been conservative, and inventory control continues to be of major importance.
