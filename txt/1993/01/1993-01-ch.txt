Several retailers noted that January will be a critical month for this year's plans, and sales gains appear to have held up well in the early post-holiday period. A report from a large department store chain indicated that sales growth strengthened in the last two weeks of December. A large retail chain reported that year-over-year sales gains in early January were in line with those posted in December, despite a more difficult comparison, and results in the Midwest were running slightly ahead of the national average. Early January sales gains were led by durable goods, notably appliances, furniture, and personal computers. Another large retail chain stated that durable goods sales gains held up in early January, after a resurgence in the fourth quarter of 1992. This firm recentlyaccelerated receipt dates for spring merchandise, which should lead to more aggressive ordering. A large discount chain reported disappointing results for early January, but was optimistic about overall consumer spending growth holding up in the first quarter.
