Economic activity in the First District was increasing very modestly at the end of 1992. Retailers reported mixed holiday results: while sales improved for a majority of contacts, a minority experienced flat results. Most manufacturers report that sales were level or only slightly above year-ago levels. Sales volumes were up for residential real estate and insurance. Although the majority of contacts expect a modest business upturn in 1993, they do not intend to hire and may even reduce their work forces.
Some contacts promoted heavily or resorted to markdowns, and margins varied approximately in line with these activities. Inventories are now even with or slightly above last year's levels; only one contact believes that inadequate stocks reduced holiday sales.
Some firms experiencing sales gains added permanent employees or granted wage increases. Similarly, capital expenditure programs parallel recent sales activity. These plans range from equipment upgrades to major expansions. Most retail contacts do not expect dramatic changes in the economy or their own performance in 1993.
Respondents report that they face a highly competitive pricing environment. Business customers in the retail, aircraft, and automotive industries in particular are pressuring suppliers to reduce prices.
The majority of the manufacturers polled expect that continued growth in the U.S. economy will have a positive, though relatively modest, impact on their companies in 1993. Most manufacturing contacts have reduced employment in the past year, with declines ranging from 1 to 25 percent. Only one, relatively small, manufacturer indicated that a significant increase in production jobs is likely this year. Roughly half the sample expect that their U.S. work forces will remain at about the current level, while the remaining firms intend to continue to implement reductions.
Capital spending trends and plans are mixed. Many contacts indicate that they are investing in new computers. Although most manufacturers contacted have pared down inventories over the past year, some believe that they can make further progress by adopting better inventory control methods.
