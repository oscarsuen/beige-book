District auto sales are reported to be moderately strong, although in Arkansas, many dealers called the past quarter the worst in years. Sales of mid-sized, moderately priced cars still outpaced the sales of all others, particularly upscale models.
Other reports show District poultry producers and auto parts suppliers increasing employment because of expansions and increased demand. In addition, a major household appliance manufacturer is not only recalling 650 workers laid off during the holiday season, but expects to hire an additional 550 during the first quarter to meet demand. A District shoe manufacturer has secured a contract to begin selling its products in four major Chinese cities. A St Louis defense contractor, however, continues to shrink with 320 more layoffs.
A recent survey of firms in the St. Louis area reveals that approximately 20 percent will hire new employees during the first quarter, while only 8 percent plan layoffs. Nationally, 17 percent of employers plan to hire, while 13 percent plan to cut employees.
