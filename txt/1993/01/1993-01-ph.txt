Reports from business contacts in the Third District in early January indicated that economic activity was expanding at a modest rate. Manufacturers noted continuing gains in shipments and new orders and rising levels of unfilled orders. Retailers said results for the Christmas shopping period were in line with or above expectations. They reported year-over-year gains averaging around five percent, in current dollars, without significant last-minute price reductions. Auto dealers reported rising sales. Bankers generally said loan volumes outstanding were rising modestly, due mainly to growth in consumer lending.
The outlook in the Third District business community is for continued modest growth. Manufacturers forecast further expansion with some gains in employment possible by midyear. Retailers expect sales to rise during the first half but they are planning cautiously for the period. Auto dealers have a similar outlook. Bankers generally anticipate only slight growth for all types of lending.
Third District manufacturers generally forecast continued expansion. Two-thirds expect shipments and orders to advance at least through June and one-third anticipate further increases in order backlogs. Although most firms indicate they will hold employment at current levels, one-third plan to step up hiring and boost hours over the next six months.
Despite the relatively good holiday sales results, few Third District retailers have expectations of strong growth in the first half of 1993. Several noted that credit card usage was high in December, and they anticipate a period of slacker sales while consumers pay down balances. In general, merchants forecast only modest growth in sales through the spring and they expect competition among stores to remain keen.
Auto dealers said sales had risen in recent weeks. They are cautious in forecasting for 1993 but believe sales for the year could exceed the 1992 level by a healthy amount.
In general, Third District bankers forecast slight growth in lending during the first quarter. They say there is little evidence that business loan demand will increase substantially and they do not expect sustained growth in consumer loan demand until employment and incomes are firmly on an upward trend.
