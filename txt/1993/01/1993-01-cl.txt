New car dealers report a mixed sales performance in December and early January. Sellers of Big Three models generally fared better than Japanese nameplate dealers, and van and light truck sales continued to grow more strongly than those for cars. Dealers claim new car inventories, in a 60- to 70-day range, are slightly larger than desired, but stocks of the new Chrysler products are said to be tight. Dealers also note that consumers are moving toward more options and high-end models within each class.
In Cincinnati, sales and starts rose at double-digit rates in November, and in Cleveland, sales rebounded after two monthly declines and were up 10% from a year earlier.
Strong demand for both passenger and truck tires has pushed tire production close to capacity for some producers. According to industry sources, these producers are planning to increase capacity to accommodate the better-than-expected sales.
Capital goods producers note an uneven but steadily rising trend in their businesses. However, uncertainty over a proposed investment tax credit has led to postponements and cutbacks in some orders. A producer of information processing equipment reports that computer orders fell unexpectedly in late 1992, after a strong increase during the summer quarter. A producer of industrial motors claims that some of its customers have delayed placing new orders until more details of a possible tax credit are known.
The strongly reviving heavy-duty truck market is apparently largely unaffected by the tax credit discussion. New orders in December continue to climb at an annual rate that is well above the forecast for this year. Analysts estimate a 20% increase in output this year from last, which will place 1993 production only slightly below the level of the last peak year in 1988.
Other capital goods producers report below-average sales growth. The market for industrial controls is gradually recovering, but is still constrained by the slump in the nonresidential building industry and by weakness in aerospace. Similarly, markets for valves, fittings, and industrial components continue to strengthen erratically.
