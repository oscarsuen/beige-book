On balance economic developments seemed slightly more positive in recent weeks, although some negative reports continued to be received. Most District retailers had sales results that were either on or better than plan in November and December. Solid gains were posted for apparel of all types, and year-end inventories were described as generally in good shape. Unemployment rates in New York and New Jersey continued their seesaw pattern but are somewhat lower than their October levels. Office leasing activity proceeded at a fairly good pace in midtown Manhattan but remained sluggish in downtown Manhattan. Meanwhile, downtown Buffalo recorded the first decline in its office vacancy rate in four years, and a larger percentage of Buffalo purchasing managers reported higher new orders and/or production. Homebuilding activity was relatively slow, but new home sales were generally above year-earlier levels. Most senior loan officers at small and midsized banks indicated no change in their willingness to lend.
A wide variety of merchandise sold well during November and December though reportedly the best sellers were practical items such as cold weather gear (especially after the December storm), furniture, rugs, and accessories. Children's books, video games and remote control toys were also popular.
Office leasing activity continued at a fairly good pace in midtown Manhattan, but has remained sluggish downtown. Vacancy rates moved up in both parts of Manhattan. Net absorption of space remained negative as a result of the completion of a new office building in midtown and the continuing additions of existing space in the downtown market due to corporate restructurings. An annual survey of office space in downtown Buffalo found an almost three percentage point decline in the vacancy rate between year-end 1991 and 1992. Although the rate remains high, this was the first decrease in four years.
The survey of Buffalo purchasing managers showed an increase in the percentage of firms with improved new orders and/or production during December. Fifty-nine percent of the surveyed managers expect an improvement in general business conditions during the new year, compared to only 18 percent a year earlier.
Two recently announced corporate restructurings will affect District employment. In the initial implementation of its plan to cut employment by 25,000 in 1993, IBM said 3000-3500 jobs will be eliminated at three of its Hudson Valley plants at the end of March. While voluntary incentive packages will be offered, layoffs may occur as well On the other hand, a Long Island firm plans to close an out-of-District plant and consolidate its operations on the Island, adding 300 workers this year and several hundred more in the future.
With regard to recent media reports and editorials urging an easing in the "regulatory burden" on banks in order to simulate lending, almost all loan officers indicated that capital requirements were not constraining their lending. However, several lenders at small and midsized banks suggested that reductions in the number of regulations and in the amount of time spent complying with them would permit them to initiate more loans.
