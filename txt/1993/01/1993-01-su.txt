Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts indicate continued   improvement in economic conditions across much of the nation.   Conditions are mixed, however, in the San Francisco district where   weakness in California continues to offset moderate growth in other   district states. Retail sales during the holiday season were   significantly better than a year earlier in most districts,   generally fulfilling or exceeding retailers' expectations.   Manufacturing activity is steady to increasing moderately in nearly   all districts, but this improvement may not be reflected   proportionately in labor markets. District reports contain little   evidence of significant upward pressure on prices. While the   residential sector continues to improve in most districts,   commercial real estate markets generally remain weak. Overall loan   demand at financial institutions is rising slightly in most   districts. In agriculture, record yields of fall crops have pushed   prices down, but gains in the livestock sector are expected to help   boost overall farm income slightly.

A wide range of merchandise apparently sold well, with some regional   variations. In the St. Louis district, sales mainstays included   jewelry and smaller appliances and electronics items. Atlanta   reports significant increases in sales of goods ranging from apparel   to big-ticket durables. In the New York district furniture and rugs   sold well. Merchants in the Chicago district noted that sales held   up well in the post-holiday period, especially sales of big ticket   durables, including major electronics, appliances, and furniture.   Retailers in the Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Kansas City   districts expressed optimism for further sales growth in early 1993.
Manufacturing activity in the Cleveland and Chicago districts has   been boosted by increased motor vehicle production and related   increases in the output of steel and tires. As a result, Cleveland   reports rising capacity use ratios for some steel producers, while   strong demand has pushed production close to capacity for some tire   producers. Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas report some increases in the   production of housing-related products, such as furniture and   construction materials. Capital goods producers reported an uneven   but rising trend in their business, with uncertainty about a   possible investment tax credit leading to some postponements of   orders.>
The moderate improvement in manufacturing activity may not be   reflected proportionately in labor markets. Boston reports that half   of its respondents expect their work forces to remain at the current   level, while the remaining respondents expect to implement   reductions. Most of the manufacturers contacted in the Philadelphia   district were holding employment steady. In the Cleveland district,   most manufacturers believe they can increase production with their   existing work forces. Some firms in the St. Louis district expect to   add jobs, however, and a major home appliance manufacturer has   recalled a large number of laid-off workers and expects to add   substantial new hires. In the Minneapolis district, layoffs by two   computer equipment firms and an airline have been partly offset by   new hiring elsewhere in the district.
Commercial real estate markets remain generally weak, but there are   some positive signs here and there. The office vacancy rate in   downtown Buffalo, while still high, fell in 1992 for the first time   in four years. Activity in the Richmond district's nonresidential   sector has increased in recent months, with vacancy rates falling in   some areas and more inquiries from businesses in strong financial   condition. Nonresidential construction has been expanding in the St.   Louis area, primarily in public works and new factories. Minneapolis   also reports a sharp rise in public works contracts, as well as in   construction of some new shopping malls across the district. One of   the new malls was built in a border town to cater to strong demand   by Canadian shoppers. Nonresidential real estate markets remain weak   in much of the Dallas and San Francisco districts. Vacancy rates are   still high in Dallas, but prices there have fallen enough to bring a   pick-up in property sales. Several markets are weak in the San   Francisco district, where commercial rents and property values are   depressed by high vacancy rates and continued employment losses.
>Metal mining continues to be weak in the Minneapolis district, where   slack orders have led to two iron mine shutdowns and substantial   layoffs. Dallas reports a slowing in energy industry activity,   although Kansas City cites a recent rise in the number of operating   drilling rigs in its district. Both districts agree that drilling is   likely to drop sharply in the near term, however, because certain   tax incentives for drilling expired at the end of 1992. Dallas also   notes that low margins have led many refiners to reduce their   capacity.
Conditions in the lumber and wood products industry vary somewhat   across the nation. St. Louis notes that orders at southern pine   lumber mills are down slightly, although production remains well   above last year's level. San Francisco reports that orders for wood   products are firm and inventories are low, while Minneapolis reports   strong demand for lumber and for plywood substitutes.
