Retailers in the First District are enjoying strong sales gains, with hard goods moving particularly well. However, many manufacturers have still not seen much evidence of a recovery. Sales of consumer and intermediate products have strengthened but orders for capital goods remain depressed. There is apparently considerable interest in capital goods, with a number of manufacturers reporting increases in the volume of inquiries and requests for proposals, but potential buyers are unwilling to make firm commitments. In both retailing and manufacturing, plans for price and wage increases in 1983 are moderate and are consistent with continued low rates of inflation. Most respondents are aggressively pursuing increases in productivity. In the banking sector, two of the largest banks in the District recently announced a merger.
Reported sales increases for May were generally above plan and ranged from 7 to 20 percent over May last year. Hard goods were selling substantially better than soft goods, although men's sport apparel was also said to be performing well. Those contacts able to make interregional comparisons said sales increases continue to be stronger in New England than elsewhere.
Firms with sales below plan or with slower sales growth in May than in April reported higher-than-desired inventory levels, but foresaw no serious problems in bringing inventories back into line. One contact noted that "lessons learned during recent hard times" allowed them to support a greater volume of business with leaner inventories than previously thought possible.
Several respondents report that demand has picked up in Canada and Europe. For most, however, overseas markets are weaker than those at home; the strength of the U.S. dollar is seen as a substantial barrier to exports.
