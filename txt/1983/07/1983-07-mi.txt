The Ninth District economy is still on the mend. Gains in sales of homes, general merchandise, and autos and increased interest in tourism suggest that consumer spending has continued to strengthen. Manufacturing and oil and gas exploration have been improving as well. But metal mining has remained in the doldrums, and signs of recovery have been mixed in agriculture. So far, the recovery has been strong enough to halt employment declines, but not strong enough to stimulate considerable hiring. Bank lending, however, has recently picked up.
Another sign of recovery is that the April rebound in auto sales has continued through May and early June. A sales manager for one of the nation's largest auto manufacturers, for example, says that his firm's auto sales in the district have in recent weeks been up about 25 percent from a year ago. Verifying this gain are Bank directors' comments about strong auto sales this spring in their communities.
A further sign of recovery is that district consumers appear to have become more willing to spend on travel and recreation. The number of tourism inquiries in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan this spring has been five times greater than normal. And the tourism association in northeastern Minnesota reports that it has distributed just about all its brochures; it had expected the supply to last through August. Businesses also have seemed more interested in travel and recreation lately. A major Minnesota resort reports that its recent reservations for business meetings have been up substantially from a year ago.
Employment conditions vary considerably among the district's four complete states, however. In Minnesota, wage and salary employment in April was down about 2 percent from a year ago, and this can be attributed largely to job declines of 4 percent in manufacturing and 29 percent in mining. Montana had a comparable mining decline, along with a 17 percent decline in construction jobs. That state's wage and salary employment was down roughly 1.5 percent. In South Dakota, payroll employment was unchanged from a year ago, mostly because trade and services employment held steady. In North Dakota, wage and salary employment was up 1.5 percent from a year ago. This stemmed from a 26 percent increase in construction employment that can be attributed primarily to a huge coal gasification project.
