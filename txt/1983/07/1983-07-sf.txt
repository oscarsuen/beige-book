The recovery in Twelfth District economic activity is gaining momentum, extending to a greater number of industries. Retail sales at department stares have been rising at an accelerated pace recently, while the recovery in Western homebuilding and sales activity has been even stronger than the upturn nationally. In the manufacturing and mining sectors, employment gains are becoming more widespread. Moreover, although the capital goods industries are not yet expanding their payrolls, employment has stabilized. The net inflow of funds into MMDAs at District banks has slowed but still remains substantial. Banks have been investing most of their excess funds in short-term Treasury securities since business and consumer loan demand remains weak despite promotional efforts.
