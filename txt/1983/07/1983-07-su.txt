The increases in manufacturing activity have been achieved largely through increases in the workweek, but the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco Districts have also experienced increases in manufacturing employment.
Manufacturing inventories have fallen recently, according to Cleveland and Chicago. A large part of the decline observed by Chicago was involuntary, with sales exceeding expectations; rebuilding is now underway. Richmond and St. Louis find that a majority of firms are satisfied with current inventory levels.
Decreases in drilling costs have stimulated oil and gas exploration in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts. Metals mining in the Minneapolis District remains depressed.
Those districts commenting on nonresidential building activity generally see a lot of work in progress but few new projects. An exception is San Francisco which reports that although construction activity is below year ago levels, nonresidential building permits are increasing.
