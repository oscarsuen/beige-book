Consumer spending, especially for durables, offers the strongest evidence of recovery in the Southeast, and retailers surveyed expect sustained growth through the summer. The uptrend in construction persists despite a recent increase in mortgage rates and an earlier drop in building permits. Business loans at large commercial banks have risen for the first time since February. Manufacturers report increased sales, some firming of prices, and more recalls than layoffs. The pickup in tourism is gaining momentum, but this acceleration has yet to reach south Florida and Tennessee. Florida's citrus industry is one of the few bright spots in the troubled agricultural sector.
Building permit activity remains strong despite the drop in April. Single-family building permits issued fell 1.1 percent from March to April. Many industry analysts attribute the decrease to aberrations from normal seasonal patterns earlier this year when lower interest rates catalyzed an unusual winter surge in building. Permit offices report that June housing activity remains stable. Atlanta housing sales are especially strong. The market now consists of individual transfers from other regions and a larger share of local buyers seeking to upgrade the value of their housing; last year corporate relocations accounted for most sales. Although fairly stable to date, housing prices may begin to rise by the fourth quarter because of inventory absorption and increasing land costs, according to industry representatives.
Commercial real estate brokers surveyed have become more buoyant in their outlook despite rising rental rates and ongoing problems of excess supply in many regional cities such as Orlando, Atlanta, and New Orleans. Commercial realtors are not worried that vacancy rates are not diminishing because they expect a 6-8 month lag between the onset of recovery and office relocation decisions. However, suburban markets in the Southeast are faring better than their downtown counterparts. The vacancy rate in Atlanta's central business district approaches 20 percent compared to a metro-wide rate of 15 percent.
