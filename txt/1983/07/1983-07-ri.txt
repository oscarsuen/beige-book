Manufacturing employment appears to have eked out a modest gain in recent weeks. Employment was actually reduced at some plants, however. Most of the recent pickup in activity has been accomplished by increasing the length of the workweek, in some cases by as much as 25% (32 hours to 40 hours per week). It appears that this process still has a way to go before output gains begin to lead directly to higher levels of employment. Current plant and equipment remains somewhat in excess of desired levels, but much more narrowly so than in most recent months.
Inventories were up over the past few weeks at the retail level, but generally remain in line with desired levels. Most retailers also appear comfortable with existing numbers and sizes of outlets.
Commercial and industrial construction activity continues to be buoyed by work in progress. New work and prospects for new work are sparse at present.
