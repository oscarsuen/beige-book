In the regions that specialize in the manufacturing of steel and producers' durables recovery has yet to begin, and some observers of these areas are not even sure that the recession has bottomed out. Unemployment rates remain above 13 percent in Buffalo and Elmira, for example. In general, the unemployed manufacturing workforce has not been called back in large numbers. Other weak spots include the agricultural sector and, possibly, the office construction industry as well.
Some local firms are beginning to increase their borrowing from banks as economic activity strengthens, but overall the pickup remains spotty. New inflows of deposits associated with the MMDAs have encouraged banks to be more aggressive in expanding loans to businesses, and demand has strengthened for construction loans, inventory financing, and loans to computer-related companies. Nevertheless, in the industries and regions where the economic recovery has not been felt, loan demand remains very sluggish.
On the price side, only a little immediate upward pressure has been felt on most prices. However, some shortages of construction materials have developed, and the increasing cost of medical insurance is raising widespread concern.
Deposit inflows at thrifts have increased as a result of the MMDAs, particularly outside of New York City. New savings inflows to New York and New Jersey S&Ls have picked up in 1983, and recent inflows appear to have been the strongest in several years. At New York mutual savings banks, the rise in net deposits since last year has generally been more modest. In part this reflects the high degree of competition for funds in the New York City market. Moreover, some of the savings banks are not aggressively expanding their liabilities as a result of concern over their capital positions.
The stronger than expected performance of the City's economy and the improved condition of its treasury helped pave the way for New York's reentry into municipal bond markets. The City's first competitive bond issue since the fiscal crisis of the mid 1970s recently received a respectable welcome in the market, although still at a relatively low credit rating.
In the northern and eastern suburbs of New York City and in Syracuse, commercial real estate and construction markets remained quite active. In other areas, the amount of new space about to come on market suggests that construction starts will be sluggish through 1983. However, most observers of commercial real estate in the District remain optimistic regarding the prospects for filling existing office space and expect new construction projects to follow before too long.
One exception is building materials. Contractors are experiencing shortages of lumber and of skilled labor. However, increases in the prices of these inputs are typical during the early phase of an expansion of housing construction.
The second exception to the general picture of price stability is causing more concern. The costs of health care, and therefore of employee medical insurance, continue to increase quite rapidly. Employers are beginning to experiment with and even implement changes in their medical insurance programs aimed at reducing these costs. Some savings have been realized, but changes are meeting employee resistance.
