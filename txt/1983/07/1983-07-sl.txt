Sales and production in the Eighth District continued to expand during May and early June, and prices were nearly stable. Residential home sales, however, declined from the pace attained earlier in the year, and many manufacturing plants continue operating substantially below capacity. Although there have been net employment gains, unemployment rose from its already high level, as the labor force was bolstered by graduates and students seeking summer jobs. Most respondents anticipate that economic activity will continue to expand during the summer and fall.
Automobile sales improved in May and early June at four dealers but slipped back at two dealers. One large dealer, with sales of both new and used cars about 25 percent ahead of last year, noted that he had difficulty maintaining adequate inventories for both autos and trucks. A dealer of foreign cars said he was readily selling all the cars allocated to him and could sell many more of the popular models if available.
Home sales in the Eighth District, which had been strong earlier in the year, decreased in May and early June. The unseasonably wet weather in May and some inching up of mortgage rates in early June contributed to the slowdown. Industry spokesmen, however, remained optimistic about future sales. Residential construction continued at a relatively high level.
