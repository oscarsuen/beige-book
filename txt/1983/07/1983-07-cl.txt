This Bank's June survey of Fourth District manufacturers shows little progress in manufacturing activity in May and June. Employment, hours worked, shipments, new orders, and order backlogs are flat.

A survey of purchasing managers in the Cincinnati area indicates a steady slowing in April and May in the rate of gain in production, new orders, and order backlogs. Inventories of raw materials and finished goods are falling. Firms report a decline in employment in May after two months of increases.
Manufacturing of light trucks and automobiles, especially large autos, is strong. Producers of these vehicles and their components report expanding hours and employment, but remain cautious about building inventories. Production of parts for the auto after-market, which remained fairly steady during the recession, is rising slowly.
Tire manufacturing is improving mildly. Tire manufacturers report shipments of original equipment auto tires up substantially over last year in line with improved new car sales, while replacement tire shipments are up only slightly. Production is up only moderately over last year because original equipment sales account for only a small share of the business. Manufacturers have stopped inventory drawdown but are taking a cautious approach to inventory building.
The machine tool industry is depressed but deterioration apparently has ended. Orders, production, and shipments are flat, and order backlogs are very low. Employment is stable, with firms reporting neither layoffs nor recalls or increases in hours. The low capacity utilization levels of customers may increase the customary lag between general economic recovery and improved demand for machine tools.
