Prime rates charged by the banks surveyed vary from 11 to 14 percent, with most falling in the 11-12 percent range. Rates have fallen around 50 basis points since last month. Roughly half of the bankers surveyed expect a further decline of 50 basis points in coming weeks while the other half expect no change.
Deposit growth is up at Tenth District banks, due in large part to strong growth of the new money market deposit accounts. Demand deposits are steady to slightly up, while conventional NOW accounts are steady to slightly down. Large CD's and money market and small saver certificates are down somewhat.
All of the banks surveyed are offering the new money market deposit account and the new Super-NOW account. Public response to the former is characterized as strong, while response to the latter is characterized as weak. Three explanations are given for the apathetic response to the Super-NOW account: weak promotional campaigns, consumer confusion, and competitive superiority of the money market deposit account (higher yield, lower service charge). Bankers report that as much as 60 percent of the funds flowing into money market deposit accounts are coming from outside their institutions. Preliminary data suggest a much lower percentage for Super-NOW accounts.
