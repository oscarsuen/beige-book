Automobile sales, especially of large domestic models, are improved in most Districts. Dallas reports sales of imported cars remain low. Atlanta notes that sales have been assisted by exceptionally low financing rates ("5.9-6.9 percent and even as low as 2.9 percent").
There are scattered reports of improvement in non-residential construction, but Chicago expects a downturn.
The new deposit accounts differ sharply in popularity. The money market deposit account (MMDA) has been marketed aggressively and has achieved rapid growth. Atlanta reports very little attrition from these accounts following expiration of bonus interest rates. Estimates of the share of MMDA deposits that are "new: money" to the institution range from 15 to 60 percent. Public response to the Super NOW account seems to be uniformly unenthusiastic. Kansas City attributes the apathetic response to weak promotion, consumer confusion, and MMDA competitive superiority because of higher yields and lower service charges.
