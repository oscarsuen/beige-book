There is no clear pattern of performance by industry or area. It appears, however, that the building materials and textile sectors may have done somewhat better than average while the primary metals group seems to have fared slightly worse.

Consumer credit activity, and particularly installment lending was not keeping pace. Another respondent remarked, however, that in his area sales continued weak and that consumer savings activity was up markedly.
