Reports from the Third District reveal an overall improvement in local economic conditions in January. Area manufacturing has posted minor gains this month while industrial prices remained stable. Retail sales are doing well, encouraged by favorable weather conditions and successful promotions. In the financial sector, both business and consumer loans are up. Mortgage rates have dropped further, bringing new life to the real estate market.
Third District contacts foresee a slow but sustained recovery for area business. Upswings in both manufacturing activity and department store sales are projected by industry spokesmen, but a hint of caution is evident in their plans. Bankers are expecting further growth in retail loan demand but predict that commercial lending will flatten out by midsummer.
Looking ahead, respondents' prognoses for the economy remain bullish. Nearly 9 out of 10 of the executives polled in January are forecasting a business pickup within six months. New orders and shipments are expected to show major improvement by midsummer, along with factory payrolls and working hours. Light growth in inventories is still planned, but only marginal capital spending increases are likely.
The slowdown in inflation, evident for most of last year, has carried over into 1983. Survey results indicate that industrial prices in January are unchanged from December levels. Moreover, inflation is expected to remain at reduced levels for at least the next six months. Only half of this month's respondents, the lowest portion in seven years, anticipate higher prices by July for either raw materials or finished goods.
Retail contacts have become slightly more optimistic about future activity. Sales are projected to maintain their brisk pace into midsummer as consumer sentiment improves. By July, volume should be 5 to 6 percent over the previous year, resulting in some real dollar gains if inflation stays low.
Retail inventories have been trimmed again in January. Stock levels are now well below those of last year and are in better shape than many merchants had expected. Retailers are still planning "conservatively," though, expecting to keep inventories tight over the next six months.
The prime rate charged by banks in the Third District has been cut to 11.00 percent since the last Redbook. Although they expect the prime to be cut another 50 basis points by the end of the second quarter, banking contacts say the decline in interest rates is slowing because credit markets are reacting to uncertainties about the direction of Fed policy.
Deposit flows in the Third District have been significantly affected by the introduction of the Money Market Deposit Account. Heavy volume in the new account, termed a "bonanza" by one local banker, has pushed time deposit levels up as much as 30 percent over a year ago. Representatives from several large commercial banks report that 25 percent to 35 percent of MMDA deposits is new money, attracted from Money Market Funds and some of the smaller thrift institutions in the District.
