In recent weeks, the Second District economy showed a few more signs of improvement, suggesting it has hit bottom and is beginning to turn up. The retail sector experienced moderate gains in December, and January sales substantially outpaced the year-ago level. Lower mortgage rates stimulated home sales and builders were fairly optimistic about prospects for the spring. Some new nonresidential construction projects got underway even though the office market remained soft. Manufacturing continued to be generally depressed, but business leaders found some indications that activity in that sector may be starting to pick up. In sum, the outlook has brightened somewhat.
The nonresidential real estate market also improved. Despite continuing softness in the office market, ground was broken for two new office towers, one in downtown New York City and one in Westchester County. Developers announced plans for other office and mixed use projects, although no starting dates have been set. In addition, construction was reported underway on a new resort development in one upstate New York community and plans for another are under discussion. Brokers did not report an increase in leasing activity but were hopeful that a pickup would materialize soon.
Jones: The economy appears to be poised for a stronger-than-expected bounce-back in the early months of 1983. The recent surge in new orders provides an upward momentum that will likely be strengthened by rising consumer demand, paced by spending on autos and housing. This should, in turn, trigger the restocking of business inventories, following an excessive inventory liquidation in the final quarter of 1982. At the same time, however, there is a possibility of near-term upward pressure on interest rates, particularly longer term rates. This will stem partly from the fact that a stronger-than-expected recovery and the related step-up in inventory accumulation will lead to an unanticipated pickup in consumer and business credit demands. More immediately, the Federal government's huge borrowing demands are likely to prove more difficult to manage, particularly if the Fed, as suggested by recent remarks by Chairman Volcker, moves to reassert monetary discipline. The expected near-term spurt in interest rates is likely to temporarily depress economic activity around mid-year. This could result in an uneven recovery pattern in 1983.
O'Leary: The fear of an ultimate heating up of inflation remains strong in the fixed-income markets and it is a powerful force toward keeping real intermediate- and longer term interest rates high. This fear is nurtured by the huge Federal deficit and the conviction that political pressures for economic expansion will cause the Fed to keep credit excessively easy for too long a time. The markets are nonetheless impressed that so far the Fed is not following the feared pattern.
We appear to be in the early stages of a general business recovery, but until there is clearer recognition that this is in fact the case, it would be appropriate for the Fed to continue cautiously to encourage lower interest rates and general business recovery. By spring or certainly by early summer, my guess is that the path of recovery will be sure enough that the authorities should begin to slow down the rate of increase of the monetary base and bank reserves. This will provide assurance that the Fed is not going to make the mistake of staying too long with an expansionary policy. Hopefully the move can be made gradually enough to avoid any run-up of short-term rates. Actually, it should help to reduce long-term rates somewhat further.
Wojnilower: Anecdotal contacts suggest, even more strongly than do the fragmentary statistics, that the economy has begun to expand. With the exception of capital goods manufacturers, attitudes among business executives have become distinctly more optimistic.
This improvement in the economic climate, coupled with official and private statements warning of the danger of re-inflation, has produced widespread market sentiment that interest rates will not decline much more if at all. This makes interest rates prone to sporadic increases until it becomes clear that the economic recovery will be anemic or, even better from the standpoint of the bond market participants, nonexistent. A collapse in oil prices would be a countervailing force that would significantly depress interest rates and, in the shorter run, also the economy. Recent contacts with individuals having exceptional high-level familiarity with the situation suggest they share the general uncertaintyâ€”and the hope, but also lack of conviction, that an orderly and sustainable agreement on a lower market price in the $28 to $30 per barrel range might be reached.
