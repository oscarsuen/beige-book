Signs off recovery continue to appear in the Ninth District. In December and January, consumers increased their spending on homes, autos, and general merchandise and were willing to spend on winter recreation. This spending sustained the revival in lumbering and in some manufacturing industries. In addition, good prospects are now reported for some district computer manufacturers, and other manufacturers seem to think the worst is behind them. Unfortunately, significant parts of the district economy have yet to get any relief. In January, manufacturers supplying industrial goods still were cutting back operations, and metal mining continued to totter from another round of layoffs and shutdowns. The Administration's new farm program might bolster farm income in the future, but at year-end it was reportedly down from a year earlier in most of the district. Furthermore, bank lending remained weak in January, which indicates that, overall, the district economy has not yet begun to recover.
General merchandise sales also have continued to improve. After sales revived in October, a post-Thanksgiving slump threatened the recovery, and retailers hoped that a late December sales spurt would let them better their 1981 holiday sales. They were not disappointed. Two large Minneapolis-St. Paul department stores report that their December sales were up about 7 percent from a year earlier. In addition, both retailers are pleased with their early January sales. According to a Montana director, sales of general merchandise have been good recently in his state too.
Consumers have been spending on winter recreation as well. In Montana, where snow arrived early, the last really good ski season was in 1974-75, and according to the Montana Department of Tourism, the 1982-83 season should top it. In Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, snow didn't arrive in many areas until late December, so the ski season got off to a late start. But where there is snow, ski area operators report brisk business in January, and they expect it to remain good. In late February, for example, the Birkebeiner cross-country ski race in northwestern Wisconsin is expected to draw a record 8,000 participants, and all available lodging within two hours of the race site is already reserved.
Prospects appear to be good for some other district manufacturers too. Due primarily to increases in defense orders, a large Minneapolis-St. Paul computer manufacturer plans to hire an additional 1,200 people this year. Due to increases in commercial orders, another computer manufacturer plans to expand its work force 8 to 10 percent this year. The district's largest computer manufacturer, whose sales of computer accessories suffered last year, reports that a turnaround looks near: its sales have stopped declining but have not yet begun to increase. A large manufacturer of housewares and another of adhesives and packaging materials voice similar views.
District manufacturers supplying industrial goods, however, report declining business. A Minneapolis-St. Paul manufacturer of industrial filters says business has been soft lately, and this firm has continued to lay off workers. A southern Minnesota manufacturer of electric generators laid off 71 workers in January. In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a manufacturer of heavy construction equipment, which once employed 2,000 workers, laid off its remaining 200 workers when it permanently shut down in January.
Recent developments in metal mining have not been hopeful either. Our last Redbook report noted that two iron mining companies were planning to recall workers in early 1983, but these recalls have been largely offset by recent layoffs. The closing of Bethlehem Steel's Lackawanna, New York, facilities resulted in 900 Minnesota iron miners being laid off for eleven weeks. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, another 700 iron miners were laid off in January. Also, the Upper Peninsula's one large copper mine remained shut down, and the Anaconda Company announced that it would permanently cease all copper mining in Montana by June 30, which will idle 700 workers.
The new payment-in-kind (PIK) program., however, should bring some relief to district farmers. Much of the farm income decline stems from large stocks of farm commodities depressing prices. In Minnesota, for example, corn stocks currently are at a record level and are up 27 percent from a year ago. The PIK program is designed to reduce stocks by decreasing plantings and paying farmers in commodities. The program may not raise prices much until 1984, but the grain that farmers will receive and the production expenses they will save should boost their 1983 income. PIK, however, could reduce farmers' purchases of seed, fertilizer, and other production inputs this year.
The more farmers participate in it, the more the PIK program will reduce stocks and eventually raise prices, and participation in the district may be quite high. In Minnesota's second largest corn-producing county, for example, officials estimate that farmers controlling 80 to 90 percent of the corn acreage will be enrolled in the PIK program. This is about twice the participation in last year's program, which was only 43 percent.
