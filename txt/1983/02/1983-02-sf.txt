The economy of the Twelfth District remains depressed, with unemployment rates above the national average, but for the first time in several months there are a few signs of cautious optimism. Automobile and home sales are up, for example, and there are reports of increased retail sales activity.

Depository institutions are actively pursuing their newly acquired deposit-taking powers and aggressively promoting the accounts with above-market deposit rates and special bonuses. These developments have increased overall costs of funds by between 25 and 100 basis points according to a special survey by this Bank.
