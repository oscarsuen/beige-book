Signs of recovery in the Southeast remain sporadic, but most respondents foresee imminent improvement. Banks and thrifts are not losing funds deposited in new money market accounts despite mid-January rate reductions. The retail sector shows ongoing strength since the holidays. Sustained upward trends in construction are generating resurgence in some housing-related industries, but the clouded situation in agriculture is adversely affecting farm-related manufacturing. The upturn in tourism is localized, but industry spokesmen convey a strong conviction that broad improvement is forthcoming. A review of the economic prospects of individual southeastern states will appear in the February issue of this Bank's Economic Review.
Conditions in the chemical industry are more uniformly negative. The industry's inventory-to-sales ratio has recently edged higher; domestic producers fear serious encroachment of market share by low-cost, foreign imports; and federal programs to reduce farm acreage are likely to diminish demand for fertilizer even further. Fertilizer plants in Louisiana and Tennessee and phosphate mines in Florida furloughed still more workers in January.
A survey of building permit departments indicates that issuances of single-family building permits continued to improve during January. Builders that "haven't been seen in a year" are now paying for permits. Still, some of the district's local economies remain in the doldrums. Columbus reports no changes in permit activity, and Chattanooga contacts observe that recovery is just beginning. Construction activity is probably most depressed in Birmingham, especially in the suburbs; some building inspectors have been laid off. Commercial permit activity remains unchanged in most of the District.
