In contrast, no turnaround is in sight for agricultural and construction equipment. The firm does expect a turnaround next summer in orders for equipment to manufacture electronic components for personal computers and defense items, because their customers' order backlogs are rising now. The firm is building a bit of inventory now in anticipation of that summer upturn. The company will recall small numbers of employees to its auto parts plants this quarter, and expects a large increase in employment in a plant that makes defense electronics equipment.
Another supplier to capital goods producers reports orders are increasing. Orders for refrigeration equipment components are up strongly in the last two months to 40 percent above the year-ago level. Orders for gaskets and seals for transportation and non-electrical machinery are also up in the last two months. A division that supplies the machine tool industry remains flat at a very low level. Orders for automotive aftermarket and aerospace remain flat. Inventories will be increased some in the two divisions with strong orders but this will be more than offset by continued reductions of inventories in the other lines.
A major producer of bearings reports a modest upturn in orders in the last three to four weeks, most notably from the automobile industry but some also from other industries. Nevertheless the firm will continue to reduce inventories this quarter, although at a slower pace than in fourth quarter. The firm expects their employment to be flat this quarter.
