Our April 1 survey of agricultural bankers indicates that the downturn in District farmland values ended in the first quarter, aided by the PIK program. Each of the District states noted at least a slight upturn. Potential land buyers who had been waiting for land prices to "bottom" have reappeared, and landowners wanting to sell are less inclined to accept low bids.
