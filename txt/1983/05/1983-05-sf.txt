Consumer spending and residential construction continue to lead the Twelfth District economy into recovery. Retail sales at department stores and auto dealerships continue to improve, while the decline in mortgage interest rates has held Western homebuilding and sales activity at levels far above those of a year ago. Manufacturing activity is picking up in a few important industries such as lumber and aluminum, but most of the region's capital goods and mining industries continue to experience extremely weak demand. Despite ample funds and aggressive promotional efforts on the part of the institutions, commercial and consumer loan demand at Twelfth District banks remained sluggish during April, but the banks report a significant increase in real estate lending activity.
