Most Tenth District savings and loan associations report improvement in deposit inflows in the first four months of 1983 compared to last year, due both to an improving economy and to new deposit instruments. Almost all associations expect continued gradual gains in inflows throughout the remainder of 1983. Demand for mortgage funds is also increasing. Mortgage interest rates range from 11 3/8 percent on adjustable rate loans to 13 percent on 30-year fixed rate loans. Rates declined slightly in April and are expected to decline gradually through the rest of the year.
