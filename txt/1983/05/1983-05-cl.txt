Except for those from the defense industry, he is obtaining practically no orders, not even for spare parts for which orders usually improve at this stage of a business cycle.

A major producer of aluminum reports that orders have improved substantially since last fall, at times coming in at a rate that exceeded capacity. The strength in orders has come from customers hedging against rising prices and a possible strike in June, from refilling the supply pipeline after customer inventories had become too low, and from some strengthening in underlying demand, especially from housing and autos. Ingot prices have risen by half since last summer but remain below some producers' costs of production as there is strong competitive pressure for market share.
