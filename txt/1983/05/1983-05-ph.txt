Indications from the Third District in May are that business activity is generally on the upswing. Local manufacturers report substantial improvement in business conditions since March. Retailers say sales at area stores are growing steadily. Loan activity has turned mixed recently; retail lending has gained ground but commercial loans have slipped slightly. In the construction industry, overall activity is healthy.
Third District contacts foresee these trends continuing for the next six months. Gains in industrial activity and retail sales are expected to continue at a brisk pace into the fall. In the banking sector, declining interest rates should reinforce current diverging lending trends. Strong demand for housing will bolster residential construction, according to builders, but commercial demand looks weak.
Survey respondents are very confident that industrial rebuilding will continue and are projecting more gains for the next six months. Expanding new orders and shipments are forecast by four out of five respondents to the May survey, and businessmen are planning to hire additional workers and to lengthen the average workweek by late fall. In addition, modest growth in stock levels is foreseen, and increased outlays for capital equipment are in the works.
Increased activity is pushing industrial prices up slightly in May, according to survey results. Input costs have risen at just over one-quarter of area plants, and a few reports of price hikes for finished products have surfaced this month, too. Respondents foresee further escalation in raw material prices by November and, to a lesser extent, are planning to boost their own prices over that time, as well.
Retailers predict that sales will continue to grow over the next six months. Declining unemployment rates and an expanding economy are expected to provide an increasingly strong stimulus to sales. Larger tax refunds will still be a factor, according in contacts, and the mid-summer tax cut also should give retail business, particularly durable goods, a boost. Merchants are projecting that, by November, sales activity will be 6 percent to 8 percent ahead of the year before.
Stock levels are about even with those of a year ago, and retailers report a little easing in their tight grip on inventories as sales have improved. Inventories remain very lean, nonetheless, and there are no plans at the present time for further rebuilding.
The prime rate has held steady at 10.50 percent at major banks in the Third District. Pressures are building, according to bankers, that should push rates down between 50 and 100 basis points by the middle of the third quarter. These pressures include good inflation news and weak demand for commercial credit. By fall, however, much of the downward pressure should begin to disappear as more consistent economic growth awakens business loan demand.
Deposit flows are still very strong in May, although activity has settled down recently. Demand deposits are a healthy 4 percent to 6 percent ahead on a year-over-year basis, down slightly from March levels. Bankers attribute that slide to April seasonal problems and a surge of IRA activity at tax time. Time deposit growth has slowed as well, indicating that the shift to MMDAs may be nearing completion. In fact, some outflows from MMDAs have been reported. Nevertheless, time deposits remain far ahead of year-ago levels.
