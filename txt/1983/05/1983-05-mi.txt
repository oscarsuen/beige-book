The previously reported upswing in Ninth District consumer spending and agriculture has continued, but the recovery in industrial activity has slackened. General merchandise and home sales were still improving in April and early May, and auto sales have begun to expand again. In addition, as expected, the Payment-In-Kind Program appears to have started to provide some relief for district farmers. The recovery in manufacturing, however, appears to have softened this spring after a spurt in early 1983. Rail and truck shipments showed only modest increases, confirming this slackening in industrial activity, and increases in airline passenger travel were also weak. Finally, lending remains sluggish at Ninth District banks.
District home sales have continued to improve as well and have sparked an increase in homebuilding. A South Dakota director indicates that home sales in Sioux Falls doubled between January and April, and other directors report increased home sales in their communities. Rising home sales, in turn, have led to a pickup in homebuilding. The executive secretary of the Minneapolis Association of Homebuilders, for example, reports a marked increase in homebuilding this spring. District residential building permits in March were up 18 percent from a year ago. Many of the homes being built, however, are the low-priced or starter homes (costing less than $80,000).
District auto sales rebounded in April, after pausing in the first quarter. A regional sales manager for one of the nation's largest auto manufacturers states that his firm's sales in April increased 20 percent from a year ago after decreasing 8 percent in early 1983. Another sales manager reports a noticeable pickup in medium-sized car sales. The directors' generally positive remarks about April auto sales in their communities confirm these upbeat sales reports.
Although district agriculture appears to have started to recover, corn planting is behind schedule. Due to excess moisture in Minnesota, only 14 percent of this year's corn acreage had been planted by May 10; normally, 33 percent has been planted by this time. Because of PIK, however, farmers will plant only about two-thirds of their normal corn acreage. Therefore, they are less worried than usual about catching up once the fields dry out or about a late crop that might reduce yields. In contrast to corn, district spring wheat planting is on schedule.
Trucking firms, however, have yet to see a major pickup in their business. The total truck tonnage shipped by general freight carriers from Minneapolis/St. Paul businesses has only increased modestly since early January. A trucking executive with a large general freight carrier, like the railroad economist, believes concerns about inventories are curbing shipments and says that building input shipments have been increasing faster than other shipments.
Like the transportation of goods, the transportation of people has increased only modestly. The number of people arriving and departing from the Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport in the first quarter was up 1.1 percent from a year ago. But it was still down 10.7 percent from the high reached in 1980.
