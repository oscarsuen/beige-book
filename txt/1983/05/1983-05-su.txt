District Bank contributions were assembled at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where a summary was prepared. That summary appears as an appendix to this Redbook.
Capital goods and mining remained dark spots. Producers of machine tools and other business equipment have seen no turnaround and future prospects are uncertain. Chicago was concerned that few capital projects were being planned, and St. Louis and Cleveland also foresaw no improvement in the next few months. However, Boston and Philadelphia noted that businesses were at least beginning to express some interest in capital projects. Mining also remained depressed, with low energy prices hurting coal mine operators in the Midwest and Far West.
On the deposit side, funds continued to flow into MMDA and Super NOW accounts. The inflows appeared to be moderating in a few Districts though. Banks are reported using these accounts primarily to fund short-term or adjustable rate loans, and are selling off fixed rate mortgages in the secondary market.
There was no consensus on the effects of the PIK program. Dallas, St. Louis, and Minneapolis expected the resulting crop reductions to improve the incomes of grain farmers. However, Atlanta noted the program was disrupting the poultry industry by pushing up feed prices. Some agricultural suppliers were aided by the increased spending associated with higher farm incomes, but others were hurt by the removal of land from cultivation.
