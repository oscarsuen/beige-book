An economist with a major producer of consumer nondurables reports nondurable goods expenditures are well on the road to recovery. The improvement seems fairly widespread across the major components of nondurable goods and he expects the first quarter to show a 3% real year-over-year gain in expenditures, the largest since mid-1981. He also notes some return by consumers from generic and lower-priced brands to higher-priced brands. A major petroleum company expects very little near-term sales response to the drop in oil prices. Expenditures on services in the first quarter will be held down because of the mild winter's impact on sales of natural gas and electricity.
The median of ten automotive industry forecasts at this Bank's Roundtable Meeting shows domestic production of automobiles rising 28% to 6.5 million units in 1983. Automobile inventories are reported to be low and, considering current rates of sales and production, are unlikely to rise excessively. Dealer stocks, which fell by 360 thousand units last year, are expected to increase by 150 thousand units in 1983.
Steel-making firms see some improvement in orders and production but are unlikely to earn a profit until late this year. Major steel producers expect domestic consumption of steel to fall by 1% from last year. One major producer notes that since 1948 domestic steel consumption generally has risen only in years when real GNP growth has exceeded 2.7%. Nevertheless, major firms expect industry shipments to rise by 20% and production to rise by 35% as both users and producers partially reverse their sharp inventory declines of last year. However, producers are likely to suffer losses again this year as transactions prices remain well below published prices and recent labor concessions reduce costs by only $15 per ton.
Steel firms had sharp increases in orders in February, mainly from the automotive sector, and expect further increases in March, but order levels remain low relative to capacity. Mills currently are operating at about 50% of capacity versus the 30% low during the 1981-82 recession. Order backlogs are rising but producers are cautious about recalling workers and restarting idled facilities. The price of steel scrap is reported to be up sharply.
The machine tool industry remains depressed with shipments expected to deteriorate further in 1983 although orders should turn up. Order backlogs at current shipping rates are only five months, the lowest in the post-World War II period. Backlogs are low more because of the record length (14 quarters) of the industry's order downturn than because of its depth (87% decline). One firm forecasts no recovery in the industry's shipments in 1983 and only a small recovery in orders.
A major producer of materials for the construction, automotive, and general industrial sectors whose output tends to be coincident with the economy reports sales were up in January but were flat in February, except for February sales gains in fiberglass for the automotive and construction industries.
