Reports from the Third District in March indicate the local economy is expanding. Manufacturing activity has surged ahead substantially since January. Retail sales rebounded strongly from a disastrous February snowstorm and are quite strong in early March. Loan activity at area banks is unchanged but deposit levels are up. In the real estate market, home sales continue to increase and housing starts are slowly coming to life.
Third District businessmen predict further recovery for area business over the next six months. Manufacturing contacts are planning for substantially improved activity by September. Retailers say sales should stay strong through the summer. Bankers are forecasting minor gains for consumer lending, but stable demand for business loans.
Manufacturing activity is widely expected to pick up steam over the next six months, pushing the present expansion further along. Area businessmen predict that new orders will continue to soar between now and September causing a widespread buildup in producers' backlogs. In addition, survey respondents say that by early fall, stock levels should have turned the corner and begun growing. Plans for stepped-up production include enlarging payrolls, extending working hours and, reflecting renewed confidence, increasing capital expenditures in the next six months.
Industrial prices are mixed in March. Prices received for final products have held steady again this month but, after four months of stability, the cost of inputs has crept upward. A return to higher price inflation as business improves is projected, but not to the levels observed in the late 70s.
Merchants are counting on a buildup in consumer confidence to keep sales moving through the summer. With the economy rebounding and shoppers' balance sheets in good order, and likely to improve with more tax refunds and a mid-summer tax cut on the way, retail contacts project year-over-year gains of about ten percent by September. Store operators, however, are planning to keep inventories in check at least until consistent sales growth is obvious. Stock levels are presently very trim.
The prime rate at banks in the Third District is currently 10.5 percent, having dropped 50 basis points since the last Redbook. Interest rates have been firming recently with upward pressure coming mainly from worries about the federal deficit and Fed policies, according to banking contacts. Nevertheless, bankers are predicting the prime will slide another 50 basis points by the third quarter, but caution that some temporary upward movement is possible before then.
Deposit growth in the Third District has been substantial over the past six weeks. Demand deposits are currently running as high as seven percent above year-ago levels; bankers cite approaching corporate taxes and an increased precautionary demand for money as contributing to the surprising strength in demand balances. The money market account continues to attract large amounts of new money and keep time deposit levels high, as well. Current estimates put time deposits 16 percent to 40 percent ahead on a year-to-year basis.
