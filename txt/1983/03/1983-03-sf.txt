The Twelfth District economy appears to have moved out of the depths of recession and into the early stage of recovery. Consumer spending and residential construction are leading the upturn. Retail sales at department stores and auto dealerships are improving, while the decline in mortgage interest rates continues to spur a steady recovery in Western homebuilding and sales activity. Manufacturing and mining activity is picking up in a few important industries such as forest products and nonferrous metals, but most of the region's industries continue to experience extremely weak demand. District banks are beginning to more actively seek consumer loan business as an attractive investment for their large new inflow of funds into the Money Market Deposit Account.
