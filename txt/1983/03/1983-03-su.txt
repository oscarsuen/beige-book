Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco all indicated that their lumber and forest products industries are strengthening. Chicago reports some gypsum plants operating six days a week with output above rated capacity. In the Boston District, housing activity is boosting production of roofing materials, building parts, wiring, electrical devices, and appliances.
In the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts the strength in manufacturing activity is more broadly based. New orders and shipments have zoomed according to Philadelphia, while in Richmond's area there has been broad improvement in shipments, orders, and order backlogs.
In other areas developments are less encouraging. Cleveland notes little change on balance, although steel orders are responding to increased auto production. Mills are operating at 50 percent of capacity as compared to 30 percent some months ago, and the price of scrap is up sharply. Industrial production remains depressed in the St. Louis District where several large plant closings are reported. Energy related industries also remain weak, and in Chicago's words, "machine tool order backlogs have evaporated."
Retailers' inventories are modest to trim over all, but there appears to be no widespread tendency or intention to add to them. Atlanta sees stocks at department stores on the rise, responding to brisk sales. Boston characterizes inventories as high but satisfactory.
New car sales, although up from recent levels, are still below expectations. Nonetheless, they are sufficient to have fostered some optimism and have encouraged production among suppliers, with the notable exception of tire manufacturers.
Commercial and industrial construction, however, is pervasively weak and, in many areas, is slowing. Only St. Louis specifically notes any strength in non-residential construction.
Banks and thrifts are continuing to experience heavy inflows of funds into MMDAs. Kansas City suggests that other classes of deposits are actually declining, but that MMDA growth is so strong that it is holding the growth of total deposits up. There are indications from several areas that institutions are coming under increased pressure to find outlets for these new funds and are therefore becoming somewhat more aggressive in marketing loans, especially in the retail lines.
