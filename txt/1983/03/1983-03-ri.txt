Survey responses further suggest a turnaround in the manufacturing employment picture over the month. Both employment and the length of the average work week rose since the last survey, although more narrowly than orders and shipments. Several Richmond and branch directors noted instances of recalls or increase in high hirings in their respective areas. Current plant and equipment capacity remains well in excess of present needs, but there is little sentiment for changing existing expansion plans.
The strength described above appears to be developing rather generally across industries. To the extent that differences exist, primary metals and machinery and equipment are among the strongest with textiles not far behind. Paper producers appear to be among the least affected.
