Savings and loan association officers report very high levels of savings inflows due primarily to the introduction of the money market deposit account. Most expect the positive inflow to continue, but at a somewhat slower rate. Mortgage loan activity appears to be strengthening, with increases in both applications and commitments. Long-term fixed-rate mortgages at 12 5/8 to 13 percent are more popular with consumers than adjustable rate mortgages currently offered at 11 1/4 to 11 3/4 percent.
