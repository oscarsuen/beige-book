Evidence of recovery has become more widespread and consistent since January, and respondents expect this trend to accelerate in most sectors. Previously reported improvements in construction and auto sales are triggering inventory and employment expansion in related industries. Mortgage rates have resumed a downward trend after rising earlier this year. Retail sales growth has tapered somewhat, but many merchants are expanding inventories in anticipation of a resurgence in consumer spending. Savings deposits at banks and thrifts continue to expand although less rapidly, and consumer lending has picked up slightly for the first time in months. The upturn in tourism is extending to more areas and markets. Farm lenders are less pessimistic than when previously polled, even though delinquencies and foreclosures are still mounting.
