The Ninth District's recovery continues to gain momentum. The directors' reports at our March meeting were unanimously optimistic, probably the most optimistic in several years. Our directors do not appear to share some national analysts' view that the February statistics denote a relapse in the economy. January and February advances in retail, home, and manufacturing sales were stronger than the increases that occurred late last year. The recovery has also begun to reach the district's two weakest industries—metal mining and agriculture. Seven out of Minnesota's eight taconite plants have scheduled some production this spring, and the new Payment-in-Kind Program has engendered some optimism in agriculture. The recovery would have even more momentum if auto sales hadn't eased and falling oil prices hadn't further curbed petroleum exploration in the western part of the district. Furthermore, district state governments' struggles to balance their budgets suggest that considerable weakness persists even though the district economy has started to recuperate. Lending remains lackluster at district banks.
In contrast to retail and home sales, auto sales appear to have weakened in early 1983. Although several bank directors report that car sales in their immediate areas have been good, regional sales managers for the nation's two largest automobile manufacturers indicate that sales in January and February were down from a year earlier (after being up in late 1982). They view this easing as temporary, however, because consumers have been showing considerable interest in purchasing cars. Early attendance at the Greater St. Paul and Minneapolis Auto Show in mid-March, for example, was at record levels.
Much of this pickup in manufacturing has come from the forest products industries. The revival in home construction continues to result in Montana lumber mills stepping up operations and Minnesota waferboard plants adding shifts. One new waferboard plant in Minnesota, which was completed last year but never opened, now plans to start operations this spring. In addition, a director with the paper industry indicates that Minnesota paper plants are now operating continuously instead of intermittently as they were last year.
At our last writing, the recovery in industrial activity had been confined to manufacturing. It is now spreading to metal mining. Seven out of Minnesota's eight taconite plants are scheduled to be operating in April. All but one plant had been shut down for extended periods since last spring. Many of the plants' operations will remain far below historical norms, however, and their employment levels in April are projected to be down 50 percent from last April.
While metal mining has started to show signs of reviving, petroleum exploration has declined. In February, 64 oil rigs were operating in Montana and North Dakota, down from 75 in December and 159 a year ago. With the recent oil price declines, the number of active rigs is almost sure to fall further.
In three district states, well-intentioned economic development programs are being promoted to offset the recession's severity. These initiatives will, of course, require funding—and at a time when revenues for basic public services are already tight in those states. Minnesota's governor has proposed a $75 million jobs program for those who have exhausted their unemployment benefits, a $30 million program to weatherize public buildings and develop alternative energy resources, a "New Minnesota Enterprise Fund" to finance small businesses, and a series of tax breaks to encourage small businesses to start up and stay in Minnesota. Montana's governor is pushing a "Build Montana" Program that would use 25 percent of the state's coal tax trust fund to assist local governments, build highways, increase capital assistance to business, and upgrade the state's economic development and tourist promotion efforts. South Dakota hopes to become a financial service center and has recently enacted legislation allowing outstate bank holding companies to charter South Dakota state banks so that they can go into the insurance business nationally. Governor Janklow has stated that as many as 30 outstate bank holding companies may be interested in establishing South Dakota banks for that purpose.
