Manufacturing inventories and plant and equipment capacity appear generally satisfactory. There remains, however, little expectation of much capacity expansion this year. Capital spending, it is thought, will go to modernization and relocation, each with cost and/or labor saving objectives. Current distress points in District manufacturing are almost entirely older or less efficient plants that are being phased out of operation.
The widely, though not universally, held expectation of continued growth in consumer spending is based largely on growing consumer confidence, improved consumer liquidity, and the belief that the recovery is still gaining momentum. The possibilities of a short-lived or very moderate recovery have not been ruled out, however, and could lead to little or no growth in sales, particularly of autos and other big-ticket items.
There are also reports of a resurgence of commercial construction activity in some areas, although these remain exceptions. Highway work is apparently providing a significant boost to the non-residential sector in some areas as well.
