Increases in total income and employment in the District since last December have lagged the nation. District employment had declined much more sharply from the prosperous levels of the late 1970's than the national total and: this gap has widened further. The strongest sectors have been home construction, full-sized autos, light trucks, furniture, appliances, recreational vehicles, and defense equipment. But most of these are far below past peaks. Paperboard shipments have increased in line with the general economy. Steel shipments will be up in 1983, but probably less than had been anticipated earlier. Retail sales are well above last year, with both hard and soft goods aided by hot weather. Among construction materials, demand for gypsum board is strong for both residential andnonresidential uses. Prices are rising again, on average, but no resurgence of general inflation is foreseen in the months immediately ahead.
Corn and soybean crops in the Corn Belt have been damaged significantly by several weeks of hot, dry weather. Yields will be down at least 8-10 percent, possibly much more if conditions do not improve soon. While the effect of lower crop yields on farm income is probably positive, farmers have sharply reduced purchases of operating supplies in line with reduced needs.
Weather damage varies throughout the District, but it is most extensive in central and southern Illinois and Indiana and southern Iowa. Further damage is possible if the hot, dry conditions extend into mid-August as some weather forecasters predict.
