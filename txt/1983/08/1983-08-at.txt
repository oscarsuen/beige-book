Recovery continues to gain momentum in most of the Southeast. Deposits and loans at large financial institutions increased in the early summer, and the improved climate is stimulating innovations and expansion of services. Manufacturers in housing-related industries are operating at substantia1ly increased levels of capacity. The resurgence in construction is helping to buoy consumer spending as well. However, spokesmen for the construction industry, as well as some realtors and manufacturers, are apprehensive that recent increases in mortgage rates may curtail the current, brisk pace of growth. Strength in the tourist industry remains concentrated in Florida and Georgia. Adverse weather presages declining crop revenues in the troubled agricultural sector.
Southeastern corporations producing timber-related products are registering marked increases in activity; they are approaching full productive capacity and 95 percent employment levels.

Pass-through traffic into Florida is contributing to the strong performance of Georgia's tourism industry. The Georgia Hotel/Motel Association reports that hotel occupancy along interstate routes is quite healthy. Convention business in Atlanta's central business districts has been off 10 percent during the first six months; however, this drop-off may be more a lagged effect of earlier crime problems than of recent economic trends. Overall attendance at Georgia attractions is, more than, 18 percent over last June. In other southeastern states, summer tourist business has been off. June 1odgings tax receipts in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee were below year-ago levels. Attendance at a number of Tennessee attractions also is below last year's levels, and at some it is below even 1981 levels. Travelers to Tennessee's largely middle-income tourist market are reportedly quite cost-conscious.
