Indications from the Third District in August are that business activity, though still spotty, continues to improve. Local manufacturing has posted major gains again, and retail sales have been excellent. Loan activity at area banks, however, has turned mixed, and mortgage rates have risen since June, causing a slowdown in real estate sales activity.  Resort businessmen report booming activity at most area vacation spots, but agriculture officials say regional crop yields are down.
Most Third District businessmen are looking for further improvement over the next six months. Industrial expansion is expected to remain at healthy levels into 1984, department store operators say sales should maintain their robust upswing, and banking contacts project increases in both commercial and retail lending by February.
Area vegetable farmers say the hot temperatures have also been harsh on their crops. The tomato crop will be about 91 percent of last year's production, and potatoes, soybeans, and peppers are all running below 1982 levels. Vegetable prices are strong, though, and growers are projecting a pretty good year profit-wise. Many of the summer's fruit crops, especially apples and blueberries, have also been sub-par.
Some crops are doing well this year despite the weather. Peach growers are expecting a bumper crop, with yields as high as 38 percent over last year's levels. The Delaware corn crop, although a little bit late, also looks good. Delaware poultry farmers are also turning a sound profit for the first time in quite awhile.
Looking ahead, the recovery in the industrial sector is expected to forge ahead over the next six months. Three-quarters of the manufacturers participating in the survey foresee better overall conditions by early next year; none predict any deterioration in activity over that time. New orders are projected to continue to outrun shipments, resulting in higher levels of unfilled orders, and manufacturing inventories are expected to grow. Survey respondents also say they will increase their capital spending by early 1984 and are likely to hire more employees and lengthen working hours as well.
Industrial prices have risen again. Reports of price hikes are slightly more prevalent than in June, as 30 percent of the respondents indicate that input costs are higher this month, and just under 20 percent say they have raised their own prices. Projections of further price inflation by next year are widespread.
With the best part of the sales year yet to come, area retailers are highly optimistic about the future. Merchants are projecting a banner holiday season and a solid start in 1984, but they say that gains on a year-over-year basis are likely to slip from this month's highs because sales in early 1983 were fairly strong. Store operators are planning conservatively, though, and they have brought inventories back in line with year-ago levels. Stocks will be kept lean, but not so tight that merchants risk losing sales if activity exceeds their projections.
For the next six months, area bankers are forecasting modest gains in lending activity. Commercial loan demand is expected to firm up slowly as businesses begin to rebuild inventories and to expand capital expenditures. Consumer lending is also likely to show further improvement, but bankers expect that further weakening in the housing sector will continue to limit retail loan growth.
Most local bankers agree that we have now seen the trough of an interest rate cycle. Financial contacts foresee rates trending upward as commercial loan demand picks up and financing of the federal deficit expands. The rise, however, is likely to be slow and irregular with the prime, currently holding steady at 10.5 percent, creeping up about 100 basis points by the middle of the first quarter of 1984.
Deposit flows in the Third District continue to weaken this month. Demand deposits have declined again, and are now only about 3 percent ahead of a year ago. That change is partly seasonal. However. Time deposits, on the strength of the MMDA, are still far ahead on a year-over-year basis. Several contacts have noticed a drop-off in other time deposits, chiefly in 26-week and 30-month certificates, apparently reflecting depositors' anticipation of higher interest rates.
The outlook for the balance of the season, however, is equally bright across the district. Advance reservations have nearly filled available lodgings at the seashore for the rest of the summer, and incoming inquiries are 20 percent to 30 percent ahead of last season's pace in the Poconos. If the weather holds out, tourist business is expected to approach record levels by season's-end.
