Economic expansion continued during June and July in the Eighth District, and most respondents anticipate that their activity will rise further during the fall and winter. Although July is typically a slow month for production, with some plants closed for taking inventories, model changeovers and vacations, the interruption this year was less than usual. The greatest strength, both in retailing and manufacturing, was in consumer durable goods, while the weakest area continued to be in business capital goods. Total employment has risen slowly. Hot and dry weather  has prevailed over most of the District, and it is critical for crops that a soaking rain come soon.
District automobile sales continued to be strong in June and July. One large St. Louis dealer reported sales 40 percent above year ago levels; he attributed the rise to incentives offered the consumer, particularly the low subsidized interest rates. Used car and truck sales were also sizable. One major dealer sold more used cars in June and July than any two months on record.
Home sales in the Memphis and St. Louis areas, which began weakening in May, remained rather sluggish in June and July. The hot weather and increased mortgage rates and home prices contributed to the slowdown. Housing starts in the District; however, remained large. In greater Louisville, a number of new homes are being built in older subdivisions that had been dormant, and in the St. Louis area housing starts were triple the level of June and July 1982.
Inventories at most District firms are near desired levels, but a recent survey found that about a third of the manufacturing companies planned to increase inventories this fall. A few firms, which raised the prices of their products moderately, could not make the higher prices stick.
