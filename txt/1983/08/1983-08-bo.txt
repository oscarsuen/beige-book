Business conditions are improving in the First District but the improvement has yet to be reflected in employment gains. For manufacturers the pace of recovery remains modest. Capital goods manufacturers in particular see only hints of an upturn. The retail sector, on the other hand, is enjoying very good sales. Both manufacturers and retailers are satisfied with current inventory-to-sales ratios. Prices remain well behaved.
Firms, even those enjoying good sales gains, are taking a very cautious approach to recalling laid off workers. Almost all of the workers who have been brought back so far have been direct production workers. Overhead and support staff levels are said to have been permanently reduced.
In general, manufacturers feel comfortable with present inventory levels. Inventories will increase as sales pick up but most of those contacted do not plan large changes. The major exception was a firm which had previously cut inventories to bare minimum; now as demand strengthens, inventories must be increased substantially. Others in this same industry, packaging, are said to be in a similar position. One manufacturer of machine tool accessories is also adding to inventories but for different reasons: demand is still very weak, so the firm is producing for inventory in order to, first, maintain employment and hold on to its skilled workforce and secondly, be able to respond rapidly when orders finally materialize.
Prices of materials and components remain stable. However, one manufacturer noted that he has recently seem more attempts to increase prices; several others spoke of how they had successfully "resisted" price increases from their suppliers. Resistance to price increases cuts two ways and some of these same firms have found their own attempts to raise prices successfully resisted. Lumber prices are said to have eased a bit; demand has stabilized and more mills have opened. None of those contacted is experiencing any shortages of supplies
Retail inventory-to-sales ratios are satisfactory. According to one retailer, "I tell my buyers 'Buy, buy, buy', but sales have been so good that inventories never increase". For another, the ratio of inventories to sales is at the low end of the normal range. One chain reports that, despite very good sales, inventories are a little higher than expected; however, since the store plans a major promotional effort with heavy emphasis on having products in stock, the higher inventory levels are not problem.
