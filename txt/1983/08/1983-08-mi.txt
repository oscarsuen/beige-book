Signs of the economic upturn continue to be evident in the district. Consumer spending for general merchandise, autos, and housing are up. Tourism is helping to maintain the momentum. There is strong demand for products produced by several important industrial sectors, and the financial sector is busy. Employment is up slightly. However, agricultural performance is still mixed, and mining related business is still depressed.
Housing activity is continuing to build. Twin Cities housing sales for the first half of 1983 finished around 43 percent higher than in the first half of 1982. June sales were up over 15 percent from May sales and South Dakota sales were up 35 percent over the sane period. Building permits in Minneapolis/St. Paul are running at close to twice the rate of a year ago. Condominium and luxury home building appear to be particularly strong in Billings, Montana. Activity is also up in Fargo and Bismarck, North Dakota.
In addition to the positive economic outlook, state low-interest housing programs are helping the trend to continue. South Dakota and Minnesota housing programs seem particularly active.
Auto sales are also moving ahead at a rapid clip. One of the big four domestic manufacturers said that June was its best month in Minnesota in three years. The trend is evident in other district states, too. From the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to Montana, district directors report auto sales to be good. Large automobile sales have been particularly strong in South Dakota, showing a 60 percent sales gain over 1982.
Competitive factory financing and an imminent sales tax increase in Minnesota are complementing the economic upturn in producing these good figures.
The economy affects more than just the number of visitors, though. Many tourism officials perceived a trend toward shorter vacations, with less lengthy stays at resorts. One official attributed this to consumer uncertainty about the economic outlook.
The economic upturn is not the only reason for these generally encouraging signs. Some firms report that the recession forced them to adopt improved cost containment and managerial strategies, which are contributing to a healthy profit outlook.
District employment should continue to improve as output and capacity utilization pick up.
