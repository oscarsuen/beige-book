In recent weeks, the recovery in Twelfth District economic activity has gained momentum, with nearly all manufacturing and mining industries experiencing some degree of improvement in orders. Consumer spending increased at an accelerated pace, widening year-to-year gains in retail sales. Western homebuilding activity also continued to pick up through June, in contrast to the national slowdown. In the manufacturing sector, even the capital goods industries are reporting increased demand. While the recovery appears to be extending into the third quarter, a slowdown in home sales in July suggests that the pace could slacken. Commercial andindustrial lending at Twelfth District banks continues to be weak, but the weakness is due to firms' improved cash flow and access to the bond and equity markets. Moreover, although District banks have begun to experience a slight outflow from MMDAs, that movement has been offset by a shift into longer-term and higher yielding consumer certificates.
