In recent weeks the economic recovery grew stronger in much of the Second District. Retail activity was very brisk in June, and though the July pace was a little slower, sales remained well above year-ago levels at most stores. Additional signs of strength were evident in the housing and nonresidential real estate markets. Business activity continued to pick up in the manufacturing sector where producers of many different goods reported rising orders. However, manufacturers remain generally cautious about production increases and new hirings, and demand for new business loans is still slack. Agricultural conditions are mixed. Fruit and field crops look good, but the dry weather in July has hurt the vegetable crop.
The nonresidential real estate sector appeared to be strengthening further, especially in suburban areas.  The rate at which available space is being leased has picked up significantly, and ground was broken for a number of office buildings in New Jersey and Connecticut. Work on ongoing projects continued strong. Although announcements of new construction projects in New York City are expected to remain scarce for awhile, several promising properties were purchased by developers in the downtown Manhattan areaâ€”indicating a definite firming in market conditions.
