The southeastern economy continues to strengthen. Employment and orders are up in regionally important industries. Vigorous retail sales during the Thanksgiving weekend have made merchants optimistic regarding the Christmas season. Housing sales have increased since the FHA/VA rate dropped, and commercial real estate investment is lively. Business lending by major banks has improved markedly, and the growth in consumer lending remains healthy. Tourist trade is picking up in several major convention cities. The Payment-In-Kind (PIK) program has aided many farmers, but heavy debt burdens presage difficulties for marginal operations.
Commercial real estate development in Tampa and Miami is proceeding swiftly. Tampa city officials are evaluating designs for a large multi-purpose convention center, and the city's first billion dollar project is under construction. Contacts indicate that Miami is undergoing an office-building "boom" fueled by developers' expectations of the legalization of interstate banking and attendant increases in demand for office space. Rapidly growing areas such as Atlanta and Jacksonville are also experiencing heavy investment in commercial real estate.
