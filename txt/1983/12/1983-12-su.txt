The 1983 Christmas season looks to be the best for retailers since 1978. In manufacturing the reports are of across-the-board improvement, while real estate sales and construction activity appear to be suffering little more than seasonal slowdowns in some areas and are quite strong in others. On the financial side, business loan demand at banks has been sluggish, reflecting the strong cash position of many firms. Agriculture, however, remains a troubled sector.
Despite the continued marked improvement in sales, retailers continue to be cautious. Chicago and San Francisco indicate that retailers have been slow to expand inventories, and only Philadelphia reports much optimism about rapid growth continuing into next spring.
The capital goods industry is beginning to pick up in New York and Dallas, but continues to lag the recovery. One of Chicago's informants indicated the level of activity in the machine tool industry remains at only about 50 percent of a "good" year. San Francisco and Cleveland report that manufacturers, like retailers, remain quite cautious about accumulating inventory.
The expansion in industry continues to lead to lower unemployment rates nationwide. However, the labor markets in Chicago and parts of New York are still weak, with both employment and unemployment lower than at this time last year.
Consumer lending is strong in most districts, but the picture is mixed with respect to mortgage lending. Richmond reports that the recent stabilization of mortgage interest rates has led to some increase in demand. Cleveland, however, is still experiencing a slowdown in lending attributable to the earlier rise in mortgage rates.
