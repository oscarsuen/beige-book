In the Twelfth District the economic expansion is continuing, although growth in some areas such as the Northwest, especially Oregon, is lagging. Retail sales remain strong and orders are picking up in a number of capital goods industries. Many firms are rebuilding inventories that have been depleted by continued strong sales. However, businesses remain cautious about adding to inventories. Nonresidential construction is showing strength in some regions of the district. Commercial and industrial loans at large commercial banks expanded in early November after being noticeably weak since mid-year.
Some manufacturers reportedly are somewhat more hesitant than retailers to add to inventories. The reasons for this apparently are uncertainty about consumer spending in the future and high interest rates. Once again, firms are looking to continued strong sales through the rest of this year to confirm the durability of the economic expansion.
Respondents throughout the district suggest that at this point businesses are not planning sharp increases in real capital outlays. Businesses still are uncertain as to the sustainability of the recovery and are reluctant to make major commitments for plant expansion. The bulk of the capital spending that is planned appears to be targeted for new equipment and modernization rather than expansion.
Depository institutions in California continue to actively advertise the deregulated deposit accounts. In general, interest rates offered on deregulated accounts do not appear to be inconsistent with other market rates, although rates on longer-term time deposit account tend to be higher in California than in the rest of the nation. In the Twelfth District, small-time deposits still are expanding, but have not shown signs of accelerating in early November.
