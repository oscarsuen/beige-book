Economic expansion continued on a broad front during October and November in the Eighth District, and most respondents anticipate further gains during the winter. Retail sales were strong in the early Christmas season. Factory orders and production continued to rise, and inventories expanded moderately. Some capital spending for the purpose of increasing efficiency has been reported. Employment continued to rise. Construction activity, adjusted for seasonal influences, remained vigorous.
Automobile sales were mixed. Four dealers reported that October-November sales averaged 14 percent above the same months in 1982, while three other dealers had small declinesâ€”averaging 5 percent. Both used cars and trucks sold moderately well. Dealers report that adequate financing is available, and buyers do not seem to be as concerned about the level of interest rates as they had been earlier.
Home sales have slowed seasonally; however, they continue to be considerably above year-ago rates. In the St. Louis area, sales of homes through November 1983 were 2 1/2 times those in the same period of 1982, and industry spokesmen expect that sales will rise another 15 percent from 1983 to 1984. Greatest strength is among first-time buyers purchasing lower priced homes. Demand for apartments has been strong; in one major county, nearly twice as many apartments have been constructed recently as in the corresponding period a year ago, and plans have been made to start building 600 more to satisfy the demand. Demand for new office buildings remains strong despite a rise in vacancy rates due to the substantial amount of new space coming into the market.
Liquidity of the banks improved as funds continued to flow in. Demand deposits jumped 14 percent in October and early November, and savings deposits increased 4 percent. Part of the expansion in demand deposits was seasonal; in the comparable period of the two previous years they rose an average of 6 percent.
