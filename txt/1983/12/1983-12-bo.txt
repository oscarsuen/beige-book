The recovery is gaining in strength and broadening in the First District. Retailers report healthy sales gains in recent months and an optimistic outlook for the critical holiday selling season. Inventories are at planned levels or perhaps a little higher. Manufacturers are also experiencing order increases and are looking forward to a good 1984. The demand for capital goods remains weak overall but signs of an upturn are increasing. In construction, the number of multi-unit housing permits authorized continues to fluctuate sharply from month to month. Permits for single unit housing are holding up despite increases in mortgage rates. Most state governments in New England experienced difficulty balancing their budget in FY83 and increased a variety of smaller taxes. As a group, the six states will move from a small revenue shortfall in FY83 to a small surplus in FY84.
Local newspapers recently reported concern among retailers that some products would not be available toward the end of the Christmas season. However, the department stores contacted said they were not worried about product availability (except for widely-expected shortages of Cabbage Patch dolls) In this light, inventories slightly above plan were seen as a positive development. A building goods specialty house, whose business is not at all Christmas-related, also reported satisfactory inventory levels.
In spite of a slow start because of bad weather the day after Thanksgiving, the Christmas season is expected to be very good. One merchant said consumers are "getting back into the swing of buying" now that the uncertainty and instability of the recession appear to be behind.
All the firms contacted are optimistic about 1984â€”even firms that have seen little pickup to date. However, one machine tool representative noted that 1985 would also have to be good for the firm to experience a real recovery, and several in this same industry said that foreign competitors have made permanent gains in market share. Much of the optimism about next year is based on the expectation that the auto industry will make some very serious capital commitments. Materials prices are expected to increase only modestly with the exception of some metals (aluminum, brass, zinc) and possibly pulp.
