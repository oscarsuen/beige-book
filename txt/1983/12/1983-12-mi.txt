The Ninth District economy has settled in for the winter with more of the moderate growth reported last month. Unemployment generally continues to fall, while consumer spending continues to strengthen. Mining and manufacturing activity may be gaining some momentum, as maybe tourist business at heavily snow-covered ski resorts. Agricultural conditions haven't changed much from last month's report.
Early reports indicate that sales of general merchandise in the holiday shopping season will be at least 20 percent higher than a year ago. One Twin Cities retail chain reports that this November is its best ever, with double-digit sales increases in its suburban locations. Electronic components and intimate apparel are moving particularly well there. Sales in Duluth, Minnesota, are surprisingly good, given the continuing weakness in this local economy. One chain in Rochester, Minnesota, recently broke its record for single-day sales, and stores have opened early to accommodate the Christmas rush. Our Bank directors report that sales are good throughout most of North and South Dakota, where snows have increased snowblower sales. General merchandise sales in Montana are spottyâ€”stronger in the western part of the state than in the eastern part.
Auto sales are also maintaining the strength evident last month. District Bank directors report that both new and used car sales are good. Order backlogs for 1984 models have appeared in western Wisconsin. In South Dakota, large cars are selling better than small ones.
Home sales have not deteriorated much from last month's pace. Unit sales in the Twin Cities in November were 14 percent below those in October, but total unit sales in that area are 35 percent higher in 1983 than in 1982. District directors report a housing boom in both Fargo and Bismarck, North Dakota, but a softening market in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The more expensive homes are selling best in Billings, Montana.
There is, however, still room for improvement in district mining and manufacturing. The industrial space vacancy rate recently increased in the Twin Cities. And, although oil and gas activity is up substantially in North Dakota, coal production is down a bit in Montana.
The stories for wheat and other district crops don't detract from this. Wheat yields are generally good in North Dakota and Montana. While the sunflower crop in North Dakota is down about 40 percent, higher sunflower prices will probably keep receipts from falling much.
However, the district's livestock operations are still being hurt by high feed costs and low cattle prices. Those prices are down as much as 17 percent from a year ago. The continued cost-price squeeze has caused a culling of herds which will further depress prices, an effect which could be exacerbated by the new dairy diversion program. Prices are expected to pick up later next year when the reduced herds are brought to market, though.
