Employment gains were recorded in most sectors, particularly textiles, furniture, and seasonal agriculture related industries. In the last mentioned category, gains were less than normal, however, and seasonally adjusted levels were accordingly down. Durable goods manufacturing, apart from the consumer areas such as furniture, continued to show mixed results.
Manufacturers responding to our survey report little change in prices they are receiving, but some scattered increases in prices paid. Respondents remain broadly optimistic. Nearly every one expects further gains in activity, nationally, locally, and in his respective market, over the next two quarters.
There has been little apparent change in the commercial and industrial sector where activity continues to improve, but only at rather modest rates. Expectations remain generally positive, but somewhat less robust than in many other sectors.
