The nonresidential real estate market remains active and has shown further improvement. New leasing commitments are being made around the District at a rapid pace. Manhattan is particularly strong, and as a result, confidence is now growing in the ability of this market to absorb the new office space currently under construction. However, some concern has developed about possible overbuilding in parts of New Jersey and Connecticut.
The State governments of New York and New Jersey have received voter approval for increased borrowing for infrastructure renewal. In November's elections a total for the two states of $1.4 billion was authorized for extensive upgrading of roads, bridges and public transportation.
Some upstate areas that were particularly hard hit by the recession now report a much more optimistic outlook and a feeling that the worst is over. In Buffalo, for example, the latest survey of purchasing managers showed the highest percentages reporting increased new orders and employment in several years.
Unemployment rates in most District labor market areas are generally below their levels of a year ago. However, while employment has been increasing in recent months, it still remains well below year-ago levels in several areas.
In line with the national trend, District banks have been stressing adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). About half of new mortgages are ARMs, and several institutions report that all their new mortgages are adjustable rate. However, portfolios still remain heavily weighted with fixed rate instruments. The spread between interest rates on fixed rate and adjustable rate contracts is currently at about 2 percentage points. This spread has narrowed only slightly in recent months.
