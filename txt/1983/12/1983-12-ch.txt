The dichotomy between stable employment and declining unemployment is explained as "outmigration", and "withdrawals from the labor force." In any case, job markets are still weak. Help-wanted ads and hiring intentions are up significantly, and lay-offs have been reduced, but these gains are offset by additional establishment closings and employment cutbacks, often through attrition. Some employers are offering generous incentives for early retirement to reduce "redundancies." Others are using overtime to handle increased output to such an extent that worker unrest has increased.
