The economic recovery in the Twelfth District is continuing with very strong growth in retail sales for a wide range of products in most areas. Employment growth was very strong, especially in California, where September employment increased by 2 percent (184,000) and the unemployment rate declined by a full percentage point over August levels even though the labor force grew by 77,000. This more than made up for California's August decline in employment. The deregulation of time deposits has had a modest but significant effect on these balances, particularly shorter-term deposits. However, the effect of deregulation on time deposits is expected to be much less than on MMDAs and super NOWs.
The PIK program was probably a major factor in increasing the incomes of grain, rice, and cotton producers. The PIK program along with the Midwestern drought, however, has probably had a negative influence on beef and dairy producers because of the resulting increase in feed grain prices.
A local Southern Idaho Production Credit Association (PCA) failed due to loan losses and was taken over by the Farm Credit Administration. There have been similar steps taken by the Farm Credit Administration at four other market associations during the past year. Some farmers are worried about the effects of these failures on 1984 crop financing.
Inflows to these accounts since the beginning of October have been modest in comparison with the surge in MMDA balances recorded in January. Nonetheless, the growth in these balances during the first few weeks of October has been significant, particularly in the shorter maturity range. This may reflect an increased desire to hold shorter-term deposits due to uncertainty regarding the future level of interest rates as well as the lowering of minimum denomination requirements. Shifts of funds out of MMDAs do not appear to be the source of this growth, as the growth in MMDA balances has also resumed after tapering off during the third quarter. While early growth figures are encouraging, most observers in the industry do not expect these newly deregulated accounts to generate substantial inflows of new funds.
