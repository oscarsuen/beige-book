Indications from the Third District in October are that the regional is expanding. Local manufacturing conditions have improved again, and retail sales have pushed even higher. In the financial sector, loan volume has improved recently, but it remains mixed. In addition, a dip in mortgage rates has halted the decline in activity in the local housing market.
Third District contacts expect the expansion to continue over the next six months. More gains for area industry are expected and substantial consumer spending growth is projected. Loan activity is also likely to gain strength by April.
Looking ahead, general manufacturing activity in the Third District is expected to continue to expand over the next six months, but, as in September, respondents' forecasts seem to predict a moderation of the recovery. Roughly two thirds of the businessmen polled forecast better conditions within six months; that is about the same as a month ago, but noticeably less than earlier in the year. Nevertheless, strong gains in new orders and shipments are likely to continue and some inventory growth is projected. Manufacturers are planning to bite more workers and to expand the average workweek, but their expenditures for plant and equipment are expected to remain relatively weak.
Industrial prices continue to reflect the rapid expansion of manufacturing activity. The prices of both inputs and final products have risen again in October, and further escalation is projected over the next six months. More than three quarters of the participating manufacturers foresee higher raw materials costs by next spring and one half expect to up their own products' prices over that time.
Because of the current surge in activity, local retailers have become less cautious about. business in the next six months. They are now forecasting gains of between 6 percent and 9 percent over healthy year-earlier levels for spring 1984. If, as expected, prices rise only slightly, substantial real gains for area merchants are likely.
The outlook for consumer spending is apparently robust enough to warrant further accumulation of retail inventories. Stocks of consumer goods, which have grown in recent weeks to levels about 10 percent higher than a year ago, are expected to swell even more by April.
Third District bankers are projecting even better business for the next six months. By April, more substantial gains in C&I lending are anticipated as businesses begin to look mote aid more toward external sources for new financing. Bankers also plan to keep the push on consumer loans and expect to see further growth by spring.
The prime rate at major banks in the Third District is unchanged at 11 percent in October. Financial contacts do not foresee any substantial pressures pushing rates either up or down in the next six months. They expect that Fed policy will counterbalance expanding private credit demands aid keep interest rates flat into early 1984. Contacts noted, however, that there is still a lot of uncertainty over the international debt situation, and that poses a threat to continued stability in rates.
Deposit flows have turned mixed in October, according to local bankers. Demand deposits have slipped below year-earlier levels for the first time in quite awhile, but time deposits remain strong. Although growth in the deregulated accounts has settled down, time and savings balances are now as much as 32 percent ahead of a year ago.
