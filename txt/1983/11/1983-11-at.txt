The southeastern economy is showing renewed strength. Labor markets in most areas and industries continue to strengthen. Demand for durable and nondurable manufactured goods is increasing. Retail sales in autumn appear to be sustaining the momentum attained in late summer, and merchants foresee an excellent holiday season. Housing sales, aided by easing mortgage rates, pent-up demand, enhanced variable-rate mortgages, and government bonds, have revived somewhat after slowing in August and September. Deposit growth accelerated in September after rising modestly during the summer, and but the rate of increase in loans, particularly to businesses slowed substantially after several months of healthy growth.Consumer lending, however, continued to expand. The tourist trade overall remains ahead of last year, but South Florida, middle and east Tennessee, and New Orleans have yet to enjoy significant improvement. Drought and reduced acreage have cut farm production and sharply curtailed business volume for farm-related businesses, but most farmers should fare better than in 1982 because of the Payment-in-Kind (PIK) program.
Commercial construction is on the rise for the third consecutive month. Nashville and Atlanta lead the Southeast in the development of new commercial projects. Realtors in those cities expect a continued strong economy to facilitate corporate relocations and prevent a potential glut of office space.
A money center bank is backing Florida legislation to allow out-of-state financial institutions to establish de novo operations in the state, thereby permitting out-of-state banks to enter the market without acquiring existing institutions. The proposal is a response to a legislative initiative by Florida bankers to limit out-of-state banking to institutions from regional states with similar reciprocal agreements.
Air travel continues to strengthen from 1982 levels at most of the region's airports. Moreover, service to smaller cities continues to expand. Convention trade is reportedly rising compared to last year in New Orleans. The planned opening of more than 12 non-chain restaurants in the city during the remainder of 1983 betokens great confidence in the future of its tourism and leisure industry. The expansion and upgrading of a major hotel in Nashville should boost convention traffic after a sluggish summer, but contacts there expect little substantial improvement until 1984. In Miami Beach, increased business travel has helped offset the effects of fewer convention delegates.
