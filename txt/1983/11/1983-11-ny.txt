Economic activity in the Second District continued to show improvement in recent weeks. In comparison to the mixed picture we reported in late summer, almost all Second District economic indicators now appear to be headed upward. Department store sales picked up sharply in late September when a long period of unusually hot weather ended. homebuilders have been quite busy and expect to remain so over the next few months. The brisk pace of office leasing activity was maintained in New Jersey and southern Connecticut and has begun to spread into midtown Manhattan as well. The New Jersey and Connecticut legislatures have authorized increased expenditures on upgrading roads and bridges, and New Yorkers will vote on an infrastructure bond referendum in November. The region's manufacturing activity expanded further, but employment gains are still slow. On the financial side, business loan demand is beginning to pick up.
The brisk pace of nonresidential real estate activity was maintained in recent weeks. A high volume of leasing transactions continued in New Jersey, southern Connecticut and various New York City suburban areas. Our contacts also noted a definite upswing in midtown Manhattan as earlier negotiations for space are now culminating in actual commitments.
State governments in the District plan a substantial upgrading of roads, bridges and public transportation. The legislatures of New Jersey and Connecticut have already increased bonding authority for improving transportation infrastructure. New Yorkers will vote in early November on a referendum for a $1.25 billion debt issue, but even if that fails, the pace of infrastructure renovation will increase in New York.
Unemployment rates have recently fallen throughout the region, but remain above year-ago levels in some areas.
Mortgage lending seems to be flat, but bank offering particularly competitive rates have been able to raise their market shares.
The deregulation of most consumer time deposits on October 1 resulted in many banks and thrifts institutions in New York City offering very attractive rates, particularly on six-month certificates where rates were offered as high as 11 percent.
