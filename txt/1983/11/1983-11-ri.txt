Widespread optimism is still the prevailing attitude among District manufacturers. A large majority now foresee continued economic expansion nationally and in their respective localities and markets over the next two quarters. Almost none believes that activity will slow over that period.
District retailers, while still optimistic, continue to trim their expectations. The most commonly held view at this time is that the level of activity will be little changed over the next six months, but no respondent expects the level to decline in that period.
Commercial and industrial construction activity is still picking up somewhat, but new activity is hardly robust. Once again, however, expectations are generally positive. Most respondents foresee continued modest gains in C&I construction activity in coming months. It should be noted, though, that office space remains in excess in some metropolitan areas.
