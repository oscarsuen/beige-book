Sales of both new and used automobiles remained favorable in September and early October. A major St. Louis dealer sold more than double the cars sold in the same period last year, and six other dealers reported year-over-year gains averaging 21 percent. All reported that sales were made with price concessions. Truck sales also were improved.
Reports from eight savings and loan associations in the Louisville and Memphis areas indicate that outstanding real estate loans rose moderately in September. Withdrawals of deposit accounts approximately matched new savings received.
