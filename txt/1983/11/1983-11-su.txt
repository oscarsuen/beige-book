Manufacturing activity is growing at a moderate pace, but only limited improvement is reported for capital goods industries. House sales are generally reported to weaker. Crop production was restricted by drought and acreage reductions, but farm income is being supported by higher prices and federal farm programs. Nearly all districts report increasing bank loan demand, while reports on deposit growth are mixed.
In addition to growth in income and employment, most-often-mentioned sources of the strength in consumption were a turn to more favorable weather conditions and a significant improvement in consumer confidence. While Philadelphia and St. Louis reported heavy promotional activities by retailers, Atlanta noted a strong rise in sales with negligible sales promotions. Retailers in most districts appear optimistic about sales in the fourth quarter, and are reported to anticipate excellent Christmas season sales.
Retail inventories described as generally satisfactory to a little high, are apparently not regarded as troublesome in the light of sales expectations. Chicago notes, however, that some retail inventories are tight enough to lead to sales losses if the Christmas season is as strong as expected.
Cleveland and Chicago note that steel orders are continuing to rise, but emphasize differences among types of steel products. Cleveland notes the most improvement in demand for flat-rolled steal, while Chicago reports demand concentrated in lighter products with plates and structurals very slow. Cleveland notes some increased demand for steel from capital goods producers. Both Chicago and Cleveland report only limited improvement in their districts' capital goods industries.
Reports on deposit growth also vary among districts and by type of deposit. Several districts commented on the actions of banks and customers with regard to the deregulation of time deposits on October 1. New York noted that many banks and thrift institutions offered "very attractive rates" but Cleveland reported that its district banks were not aggressive about the new deposits. Richmond and Kansas City agreed that there was little effect on their financial institutions and little response from customers. San Francisco saw some significant early growth in new deposit accounts, but does not expect them to generate substantial inflows of new funds.
