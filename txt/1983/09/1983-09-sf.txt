The Twelfth District economic recovery is continuing, but at a slower pace, due largely to the decline in residential construction and its ripple effects on such key industries as lumber. Apart from a shortage-induced decline in automobile sales, consumer spending remains strong, with department stores experiencing a widening year-to-year gain in sales in August. Western homebuilding activity has been falling off moderately since June, however, and an even sharper decline in home sales suggests a further slowdown in starts in coming months. In the manufacturing sector, overall employment growth has clearly slowed. Some capital goods industries—especially electronic equipment—are experiencing increased order inflow, however. Consumer lending at Twelfth District banks has been especially strong due mainly to increased consumer spending but also due to banks' promotional efforts. Applications for mortgage loans have dropped dramatically.
