The pace of recovery in the Southeast is showing signs of slowing, but most sectors continue to expand. Consumer spending remains strong although unseasonably hot weather resulted in lower-than-anticipated back-to-school clothing sales. Industrial employment and orders are generally rising, but some reversals appear imminent especially in the forest products industry. Higher mortgage rates have reduced sales of new homes from levels attained earlier this summer. In the financial sector deposit and loan growth is weaker than in June. The surge in central Florida tourism shows further indication of ebbing. Drought-induced crop shortages are likely to increase food prices and lower revenues for crop and livestock farmers.
Commercial real estate, especially suburban office space and shopping center developments, continues to improve in spite of the recent rise in interest rates. Markets in most central business districts. including Atlanta's, are also tightening. However, gluts in office space continue in Orlando and New Orleans. Because of expected ongoing improvement in the economy, industry contacts foresee a spurt of commercial construction contracts throughout the region within the next six months.
Regional bank executives have proposed the creation of a southeastern banking zone, whereby southeastern state banking laws would allow mergers and acquisitions only by financial institutions headquartered in the region. This arrangement would allow southeastern financial institutions to consolidate their competitive positions before large-scale interstate banking becomes a reality. Several major, money center banks recently applied to Florida banking authorities to establish industrial savings banks.
Tourist trade appears strong in Alabama and Georgia, where late summer attraction attendance, lodgings tax receipts, and visitor center registrations rose above year-ago levels. Georgia's tourism industry representatives attribute much of this year-over-year improvement to an increase in auto travel relative to air travel as a consequence of cutbacks in discount airfares. Prospects for the 1984 World's Fair in New Orleans improved in the late summer: a number of exhibitors firmed commitments, and several auto and bus associations purchased a total of 500,000 Fair tickets. However, Fair construction is hampering access to New Orleans' tourist district and thereby exacerbating already depressed conditions in that sector of the local economy. Mississippi tourism spokesmen blame the rather lackluster level of business this summer on the Fair, which, they say, is causing travelers to defer trips to Mississippi until next year.
Georgia and South Carolina growers, who lost much of their crop to a late spring freeze. will now find it difficult to sell their smaller, drought-stricken apples in the retail market and will have to divert such fruit to lower revenue outlets, such as processing or juice.
