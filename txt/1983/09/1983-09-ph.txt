Reports from the Third District point to mixed economic conditions in September. The strength in activity remains centered in the manufacturing and retail sectors, where surprisingly robust growth has continued this month. Loan volume at area financial institutions, however, has weakened recently, and is mixed. Activity in the housing market continues to nose downward as mortgage rates rise.
Third District contacts foresee general improvement in business activity over the next six months. Both retail and manufacturing executives project healthy gains into 1984, although a slowdown in growth is anticipated. Local bankers are forecasting a sluggish upturn in lending activity and interest rates by next March. The outlook for housing is not bright, however, especially if mortgage rates continue to rise.
Despite the vigorous expansion currently underway in the manufacturing sector, survey respondents' outlooks have mellowed somewhat this month. Two-thirds of the participating businessmen expect further improvement in industrial activity over the next six months, fewer than at anytime in the last year. Climbing levels of new orders and shipments are still forecast, although not as strongly as in recent months, and further expansion of the factory workforce and working hours are planned. Capital expenditure plans are still fairly weak, but solid growth in inventories by the end of the first quarter is projected. Overall, survey respondents obviously expect the recovery to continue, but they seem to be indicating a slower rate of expansion over the next six months.
Prices in the manufacturing sector continue to drift upward, but survey results indicate that, on average, the pace remains slower than in the past. Roughly one-third of the participating businessmen report paying higher input prices since August, and another sixth have raised their final products' prices this month. Further increases in industrial prices are likely by March.
Area merchants predict that consumer spending will be healthy in early 1984 but that sales growth will settle down to more modest levels near year-end. Following a "reasonable" holiday season, gains of four percent to five percent over a year-earlier are expected for the first quarter of 1984. The cheery forecast has encouraged store operators to be less cautious about inventories, and stock levels, which are currently a little higher than a year ago, have notched some growth since August. Contacts indicate, however, that any further inventory growth will be carefu1ly controlled.
Area banking officials foresee gradual improvement in overall lending activity over the next six months. C&I loan demand is expected to gain strength slowly through next March as commercial investment expands beyond the funds available internally. Most bankers also predict that consumer demand for credit will expand further despite the likelihood of slightly higher interest rates. Many lenders plan to maintain their aggressive marketing posture.
The prime rate charged by major Third District banks has risen to 11 percent in September from 10.5 percent in early August. Local seers are predicting that, because of positive reports on inflation and the money supply, upward movement in interest rates over the next six months will remain sluggish.. They are forecasting an increase in the prime and most other rates of between 50 basis points and 75 basis points by the end of the first quarter as both private and government borrowing expand.
