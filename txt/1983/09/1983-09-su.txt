Manufacturing output is increasing at a slow pace relative to most other sectors of the economy. The demand for heavy capital equipment, which had been particularly sluggish, is showing signs of improvement. Auto sales continue to be brisk and would have been even stronger were it not for short inventories of larger domestic and Japanese models. Housing sales have declined recently throughout the nation, and the hot dry weather that has persisted over much of the Midwest has severely damaged many crops.
Sales of heavy capital equipment, on the other hand, continue to be sluggish. Many plants in the Chicago District remain closed or are operating at less than 50 percent capacity. However, the manufacture of tandem trailers, permitted under the new federal law, has been particularly strong.
However, New York, Richmond and Kansas City indicate that construction activity remains an relatively high levels. Construction activity in New York has been so brisk that shortages of supplies and labor have developed.
Demand for mortgage loans continued at the relatively high levels established earlier in the year. However, a number of districts, indicating that this is a result of previous commitments, report a drop in applications for new mortgage loans.
San Francisco reports that unseasonable rains in Southern California have damaged a number of crops. However, farm income in this District is expected to be relatively high this year due to the combined effects of the drought experienced in the rest of the nation and large PIK transfers.
