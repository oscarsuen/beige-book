The broadly based economic expansion continued during August and early September in the Eighth District, and most respondents expected further gains during the fall and winter. Retail sales continued strong, factory orders and production rose, and employment increased. Orders for business equipment, however, remained depressed, housing and auto sales slipped, and the hot dry weather destroyed many crops.
Automobile sales continued to be lively, but were down from peaks reached in June and July. Inventories are low at a number of dealers, and several said they could have sold more if the cars had been available. Demand for used cars remains good, and prices of late models have risen.
Home sales remained below the pace reached in the spring, but were still up substantially from a comparable period a year ago. Higher interest rates and the hot weather contributed to the slowdown. Housing construction, however, continued to rise.
