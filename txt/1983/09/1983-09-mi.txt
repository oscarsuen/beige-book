With the exception of a dip in real estate and related activities, the economic recovery continues despite higher interest rates. Consumer spending for general merchandise and autos has not declined much from the torrid pace reported in our last report. Tourism has finished the summer on a good note. Some bright spots continue to turn up in manufacturing. The outlook for district crops has improved, due to favorable changes in local weather, the federal Payment-In-Kind (PIK) program, and higher prices. However, higher corn prices have hurt livestock profits. Financial activity appears normal. The weakest spot in our economy continues to be raw material extraction and processing. Due to the rise in interest rates, though, real estate and related activities have begun to weaken somewhat as well.
Van and recreational sales led the way in producing healthy automotive sales figures. District managers for domestic auto producers report good increases in both truck and passenger car sales over last July and August. Vehicle inventories are lean. This good news was corroborated by our Bank's directors, who reported good auto sales in southern Minnesota, in parts of Wisconsin and the Dakotas, and even in economically troubled northern Minnesota.
