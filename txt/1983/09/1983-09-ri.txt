Manufacturers' inventories particularly of finished goods, continued to decline according to our respondents. There are now scattered reports of shortages of finished goods on band and total stocks are now essentially in line with desired levels. In addition, there are beginning to be reports of inadequate plant and equipment capacity and, in a few cases, of inadequate plans for expansion of that capacity.
Price increases are also becoming more common among manufacturers. Nonetheless, a majority of respondents continue to report stable prices for goods bought and sold. A larger majority continues to report stable employee compensation in terms of average hourly earnings. District manufacturers remain optimistic with a large majority expecting further gains n business activity, nationally, locally, and in their respective markets over the next six months.
District retailers remain basically optimistic, but their outlook for the next six months has become significantly less ebullient in recent weeks. Although none expects any decline in activity, many apparently feel that the potential gains in activity have, for the most part, been achieved.
Reports of a resurgence in commercial and industrial, particularly commercial, construction plans and activity have become much more widespread the last few weeks. Several of the District's major metropolitan areas are reporting major projects in various stages. These reports clearly suggest that the commercial construction pipeline is filling up. It is probably too early to tell, however, when the process will become more widespread.
Nonetheless, as a result of generally soft loan activity competition for consumer deposits like MMDAs has not been particularly aggressive and rates on those deposits have risen only about one-quarter to one-half as far as money rates generally.
