The major portion of the data for this report was gathered in a survey of fourteen of the larger savings and loan associations in the Eleventh District. The associations surveyed reported: (1) Most associations had recorded deposit inflows since November 1969, with the weighted average rate of inflow of 4.0 per cent (2) The majority of associations had recorded increases in loans ranging from 2 to 15 per cent, yielding the weighted average increase of 4.4 per cent since November of last year (3) Commitments at most of the institutions surveyed were up substantially over last year (4) Nearly two thirds of those surveyed had recently reduced their rate on home mortgages, with the most quoted rate in the range of 8 1/2 per cent (5) About half of those surveyed felt that residential construction was being limited by huge construction costs (6) About half of the associations are now making loans on mobile home purchases, although these are fairly new loan programs (7) Most report that the price range of homes being constructed has risen somewhat in recent years, with the largest volume being constructed in the $20,000-$30,000 price range.
Current levels of economic activity within the Eleventh District seem to indicate that the regional economy bottomed out sometime late this summer and is now showing a very moderate upward trend. Modest gains in industrial production have been made, as the decline in durable goods manufacturing was more than offset by high levels of nonmanufacturing and oil activity. The decline in durable goods was due mainly to declines in transportation equipment and machinery. The return of the auto workers to the GM assembly plant at Arlington, Texas, should have a positive effect on durable goods production; however, this may be partially offset by further downward adjustments in the aerospace industry. As a whole, industrial production in Texas during the first ten months of 1970 has shown a significantly smaller increase than in previous years.
There have been recent modest gains in employment in the District, with the unemployment rate for Texas running substantially below the national average. However, projected growth in the labor force is expected to outstrip gains in employment. Construction—particularly nonresidential construction—has shown some improvement in recent months, while department store sales in November were up only 3 per cent over the same month last year.
