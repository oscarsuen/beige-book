A strike involving 5,000 workers at the Atomic Energy Commission's Oak Ridge, Tennessee, plant is entering its third month. Gulf states utilities continue to be picketed, and a walkout involving 1,200 has idled production at a Birmingham plant. The Florida Power and the Miami plumbers' strikes have been settled. The plumbers will receive about a 25 percent yearly pay boost over the three-year contract. Employment is stabilizing at two large military installations contacted. Recent employment cutbacks at these two installations have been accomplished by normal attrition.
