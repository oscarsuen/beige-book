Fifth District trucking companies saw strong growth in recent weeks. Contacts reported an increase in business after a slow start to the year with growth in shipments of most goods. One firm noted a strong increase in food shipments but a softening of government business. A North Carolina company was overbooked heading into the busy spring season. Similarly, a Virginia firm reported capacity constraints, with more freight than trucks, although all the firmâ€™s trucks had enough drivers. However, one contact reported a drop in volumes but still maintained good profit margins and revenue growth.
On the whole, retailers experienced sluggish conditions since our last report. Several contacts attributed poor sales to bad weather. A Virginia high-end clothing store reported that sales have been persistently bad since November. A contact at a Virginia furniture store attributed business swings to unstable consumer confidence. Meanwhile, a North Carolina auto dealer reported low sales, resulting in a build-up of inventory. On a positive note, a regional hardware store had strong sales in March and most retailers remained optimistic about 2019.

Vacancy rates increased slightly for some office and retail markets. Meanwhile, rental rates were reportedly stable to increasing modestly.
