District firms noted that annual wage increases, on average, remained around 3 percent, though much higher for in-demand and difficult-to-fill positions (e.g., medical professionals, engineers, drivers, skilled laborers, IT professionals, and executives). Some employers shared that although wage growth had successfully helped secure staff, there was little appetite for significant upward movement in 2019.
Tourism contacts across the District noted overall activity was good. Advance bookings for 2019 were strong. Contacts noted that demand for hotel rooms continued to be robust even though the window for bookings has become shorter as a result of the increased usage of smartphone travel apps where travelers can take advantage of lower room rates for last minute travel plans. On balance, business sentiment among travel and hospitality contacts is cautiously optimistic for 2019.
Overall economic growth continued to positively influence and propel commercial real estate fundamentals in most District markets and property sectors. Multifamily occupancies remained tight, and overall rents grew at a more robust pace compared with a year ago. Industrial sector dynamics remained robust, while office fundamentals accelerated. Contacts noted that moderating interest rates may encourage some commercial buyers back into the market.
