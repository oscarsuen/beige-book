Contacts continued to report that tight labor market conditions were constraining growth. One staffing firm noted that firms struggled to staff extra shifts. Another contact reported that restaurants had lost workers who had returned to their home countries. While most manufacturing firms also noted difficulty in finding labor, two firms said it "just takes longer," two more reported successfully attracting employees and reducing turnover by increasing wages and other benefits, and another firm noted that Pennsylvania has good labor availability.
Wage growth continued at a moderate pace, with reports of wage and benefit cost increases averaging about 3 percent. The share of nonmanufacturing contacts who reported increases in wage and benefit costs edged up to 45 percent. However, several contacts noted that the pace of wage growth had slacked off a bit.
Looking ahead six months, the percentage of manufacturing firms that expect to pay higher prices for inputs rebounded to 55, and the share of firms expecting to receive higher prices for their own goods rose to nearly 40 percent.
The makers of primary and fabricated metal products and of industrial equipment tended to note gains in new orders and shipments; the makers of chemicals, paper products, and electronic products noted some weakness or declines since the prior period. Overall, the majority of these sectoral trends for this period were weaker than those reported for the same period last year.
Comments on current business conditions were mainly negative and often cited decreased global demand. One firm noted that customers were taking longer to pay. One large firm reported that its input costs continue to rise as more and more suppliers pass on their tariff costs. In addition, this firm noted that it has cut back on hiring because of tariff uncertainty. Another contact noted that one small builder had stockpiled a three-year supply of nails.
Manufacturers continued to expect general activity to increase over the next six months. However, expectations were somewhat lower this period, as were expectations of shipments, new orders, and planned capital expenditures. Expectations of future employment held steady. On balance, expectations for each of these indicators were below their historic nonrecession averages, except for capital expenditures, which remained on par.
Auto sales continued at high levels, but reports were mixed. In Pennsylvania, dealers reported strong year-over-year growth for March and for the first quarter, but they had reported comparable declines for the same periods last year. New Jersey dealers reported declining sales for March, but sales were flat for the first quarter.
Tourism activity picked up slightly as the winter season drew to a close. One contact noted that a late winter snowstorm had moved ski resorts above budget, while a high-end shore hotel had its best February ever. Most contacts were optimistic for the coming summer season.
During the current period (reported without seasonal adjustments), volumes grew robustly in commercial real estate loans and in commercial and industrial lending. Loans grew slightly for homes and autos. Home equity lines and other consumer loans (not elsewhere classified) declined.
A few contacts voiced concerns about looser lending standards; more noted overly aggressive pricing, especially on commercial loans. Overall, contacts continued to note few problems with credit quality. Bankers reported that they and their customers remained largely optimistic for the remainder of 2019.
Existing home sales continued to decline moderately across most local markets. Sellers remain sidelined, and extremely low inventories continue to constrain sales.
On balance, commercial real estate construction and leasing activity continued to edge down slightly from relatively high levels. Contractors noted that activity was about the same, but the backlog is smaller, and design firms are less busy. Demand remained strong for industrial and warehouse space; however, absorption has become difficult in smaller markets with an insufficient supply of labor.
