Wage pressures rose moderately. A major retailer publicly announced a one-dollar increase to base pay, to $13 an hour, starting in June. Staffing contacts in Michigan’s U.P. and western South Dakota noted that pay rates have risen 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively, over the past 12 months. Two ad hoc polls by the Minneapolis Fed (one in Minnesota, one District-wide) found that wages have risen by more than 3 percent over last year. However, a majority of respondents to three other ad hoc polls (one in Montana and two in Minnesota) pegged recent wage increases below 3 percent; they also expected roughly the same level of wage pressure going forward.
Commercial real estate grew modestly since the last report. In Minneapolis-St. Paul, multifamily permitting slowed down in the first quarter, but new-unit deliveries this year were expected to remain strong and vacancy rates tight. New office construction in the region has fallen, but a significant amount of renovated space was scheduled to re-enter the market this year. Industrial vacancy rates remained low. In Sioux Falls, multifamily development has slowed and vacancy rates have risen to about 10 percent. Retail vacancy was high in the city’s busiest retail corridor, but activity was reported to be stronger in other, outlying areas of the region. Residential real estate in the District was lower compared with the same period a year ago. February home sales were mixed compared with a year ago, rising modestly across Minnesota, but falling in many other markets. However, preliminary March data suggested home sales fell in Billings, Sioux Falls, and Minneapolis-St. Paul. Sources expected a rebound in home sales in the near term.
