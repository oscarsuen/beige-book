With tight labor markets, wage growth has been steady in recent months. One major employment agency in New York City noted that salaries have not risen as much as one would expect given the tightness of the labor market. Two employment agency contacts noted a large and widening gap between salary demands and salary offers, noting that this has led some employers to miss out on good candidates. Manufacturers, in particular, were said to be holding the line on wages, while service firms have become somewhat more flexible.
Retailers generally indicated that selling prices have been essentially flat. One major chain reports somewhat steeper discounting to clear out excess inventories, but another contact notes less seasonal discounting than in years past. Nightly rates for New York City hotel rooms and prices for Broadway theatre admissions have slipped in recent weeks and were down roughly 10 percent from a year earlier.
New vehicle sales remained quite weak through March, according to dealers in upstate New York, falling well below year-ago levels. With this slowdown, new vehicle inventories have grown above desired levels. Sales of used vehicles were said to be steady to down slightly in recent months. Dealers indicated that consumer credit has remained widely available.
Consumer confidence in the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, PA), which had been at or near record levels for most of the past year, fell to a 14-month low in March, based on the Conference Board’s monthly survey.
Looking ahead, contacts in the manufacturing and distribution sectors have become less optimistic about future business conditions. A number of contacts continued to express concern about trade uncertainty, tariffs, and the recent increase in New York State’s minimum wage.
Leisure & hospitality businesses reported little or no growth in recent months. Tourism to New York City has softened noticeably, particularly in the last couple of weeks. Hotel occupancy rates and revenues weakened in the latter part of March, slipping well below comparable 2018 levels. Likewise, Broadway theaters reported that attendance and especially revenues became progressively weaker during March, slipping below year-ago levels. Part of this apparent softening may be attributable to unseasonably cold weather and a later Easter.
Residential rents across the District have risen modestly since the last report and are up from a year earlier. In New York City, rents have resumed a modest upward trend as rental vacancy rates have declined from already low levels and landlord concessions, though still prevalent, have receded gradually.
Commercial real estate markets have been steady to slightly firmer in the latest reporting period. Office availability rates and asking rents have been steady overall. The market for retail space has been mixed, with rents edging down across the New York City area but rising modestly across most of upstate New York. Retail vacancy rates have been mostly flat. Industrial markets, on the other hand, have continued to strengthen: rents have continued to climb at a moderate rate, while availability rates have held steady at fairly low levels.
New multi-family construction starts remained sluggish, but there continues to be a sizable volume of residential space under construction in and around New York City. In New York City, office construction has picked up, and there continues to be a high volume of office development in progress, with a large amount of space scheduled to come on-line over the remainder of 2019.
