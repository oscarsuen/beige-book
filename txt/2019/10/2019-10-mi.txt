Wage pressures were moderate overall. A solid majority of human resources poll respondents in Minnesota and Montana said that wages rose by 3 percent or less over the past 12 months, and wage expectations for the coming 12 months were softer. Wage growth was stronger among construction and staffing contacts in Minnesota, but each group also expected wage pressure to lessen somewhat in the coming year. A staffing contact in Montana said wages for entry-level positions continued to rise, and those who raised wages last year to stay competitive were re-evaluating additional increases. A North Dakota staffing contact noted that while wages were rising overall, some clients were intentionally not raising wages for unskilled labor because it "does not make much difference" in the workers they attract or retain, "unless they raise pay scales significantly."
Tourism saw growth overall in the most recent period. In northern Wisconsin, tourism businesses reported strong activity at the end of the summer, with lodging facilities seeing solid bookings through mid-September. A large campground in the region reported modestly more summer bookings and higher average customer spending. Hotel occupancy rates in Minnesota were slightly higher in August compared with a year earlier, and revenue per room was 3 percent higher. Total passengers at District airports increased compared with a year earlier: August passengers through Minneapolis-St. Paul were up 3 percent, and seven other regional airports saw increases ranging from 4 percent to 20 percent. However, among nine major national parks in District states, only two registered an increase in August visitors compared with a year earlier.
Commercial real estate grew modestly since the last report. Despite steady delivery of new units, multifamily housing vacancy rates in Minneapolis-St. Paul remained among the lowest in the country for major metropolitan regions, leading to rent increases. Industrial space in the region continued to see low vacancy rates and healthy expansion. New retail construction in Minneapolis-St. Paul has declined, although grocery has continued its expansion in the region, and vacancy rates remained fairly stable. Residential real estate was mixed. Closed home sales in August fell compared with a year earlier across Minnesota, as well as in Missoula, Mont., Sioux Falls, S.D., Grand Forks, N.D., and northern Wisconsin. However, closed sales rose in Bozeman and Helena, Mont., Fargo, N.D., and western Wisconsin.
