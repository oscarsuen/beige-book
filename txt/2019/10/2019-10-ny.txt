Prices of New York City condos and co-ops, which had been fairly steady through mid-year, slipped noticeably in the third quarter—most sharply in Manhattan.

Moreover, the inventory of resale inventories has risen noticeably. In contrast, home prices in the suburbs north of New York City have continued to rise slightly, while sales volume and inventory levels have been steady.
