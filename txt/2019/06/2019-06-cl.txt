Wages rose moderately as employers encountered tight job markets. Although wages rose in all industries, they rose faster in white-collar industries than in blue-collar industries. Professional and business services firms reported difficulty finding qualified workers and found that competitors were luring away workers by offering higher salaries. One technology contact reported that he had given raises to employees who had been with the firm less than a year in an effort to retain them. Bankers reported wage increases across job levels, but especially for tellers, in order to compete with recent wage increases from retailers. General merchandise, food and hospitality, and auto retailers all reported raising wages because of competition for workers. Wages in the freight sector rose modestlyâ€”one freight contact characterized it as an "upward drift." Construction firms held wages steady, for the most part. A few manufacturers raised wages for retention, citing tight labor markets, but fewer raised wages than had in the prior two periods.
