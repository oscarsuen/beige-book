Economic activity in the Seventh District remained slow in late January and early February, due mainly to softness in the manufacturing sector.  Retail sales were stronger than most contacts expected, but spending was driven in large part by substantial price discounting.  Overall construction activity remained relatively strong, despite some softening in nonresidential building.  The manufacturing sector continued to contract, and most contacts did not expect to see much improvement until the second half of the year.  Business lending slowed slightly in recent weeks and there were a few new reports of deteriorating loan quality.  Labor markets generally remained tight, but employers were reporting greater success in finding and retaining workers.  Retail price inflation generally was subdued, but there were new reports of increasing prices at the producer level.  High natural gas prices continued to impact nearly all sectors, and were expected to be a disruptive influence on spring planting as the consequent high cost of nitrogen fertilizer forces Corn Belt farmers to rearrange planting priorities.
