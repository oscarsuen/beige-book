Auto dealers generally indicated that sales picked up a bit in January compared to December, but were just steady during February, and below the rate posted in February of last year.  Inventories were above desired levels, and dealers were looking to continued manufacturers' incentives to reduce the oversupply.

Builders indicated that the availability of labor and materials has improved compared with last year but that land has become less available and more expensive.
