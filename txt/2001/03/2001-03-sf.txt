Reports from contacts pointed to more modest growth in the Twelfth District economy in recent weeks and some easing of conditions in tight labor markets.  Respondents reported moderate to weak retail sales so far in 2001 and mixed trends in manufacturing.  The farm sector continued to be characterized by low product prices and high costs.  Real estate and construction activity generally remained strong, although ongoing dot-com cutbacks have increased availability in commercial office markets in California and Washington.  District respondents noted that credit markets have experienced moderate tightening in recent weeks.
Respondents cited a slowdown in labor market turnover and some easing of  pressures on wages as evidence that labor market conditions have loosened to some extent.  However, several contacts indicated that benefits costs continued to climb at double-digit rates.  Respondents noted that, in general, increased wages, benefits, and most material costs could not be passed along to consumers.  One exception appears to be energy costs.  Several contacts in the services and manufacturing sectors noted that higher fuel and energy prices are being passed on; surcharges on goods and services, including hikes in charges for freight deliveries and hotel rooms, have become more common in recent weeks.
