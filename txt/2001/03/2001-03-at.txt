The Sixth District economy continued to post only tepid growth, according to recent contacts.  Merchants' sales were slightly above or equal to year-ago results.  Lower mortgage rates boosted single-family construction and home sales, but commercial markets continued to slow.  The manufacturing sector continued to contract.  Lending activity was subdued, particularly in the auto sector.  Reports from the tourism and hospitality sector were generally positive.  Labor markets eased in parts of the District, and most prices remained stable.
Commercial construction continued to slow in most of the District.  Vacancy rates generally remained at low levels but have increased slightly recently in several office markets, including Atlanta, Jacksonville, and Nashville, as well as in the Nashville industrial market.  Office markets in Miami remained strong.  Developers and lenders are proceeding more cautiously with new projects in most areas and are requiring higher levels of pre-leasing.  Overall, contacts continued to see little risk of a sizable, prolonged downturn in commercial real estate markets in the District.
Competition and weaker demand held down prices for most sectors, with the usual exceptions.  Health insurance premiums continued to rise at double-digit rates; these large medical benefit cost increases have become a problem for many employers, and more firms have restructured benefit programs or increased employee co-pays.  High energy price increases continued to adversely affect regional industries except for the energy extraction sector.  Fuel cost increases forced many small trucking companies into bankruptcy.  High fertilizer and pesticide prices are expected to squeeze many District farmers.  Several contacts noted that companies cut or held prices steady in order to secure market share in the face of slower demand.
