The Tenth District economy remained sluggish in January and early February. Retail sales were soft in much of the district, residential building was flat, and commercial construction edged down. Manufacturing continued to be the weakest sector, as activity declined further. On the positive side, energy activity continued to benefit from high oil and gas prices. In the farm economy, snowfall improved growing conditions for the winter wheat crop but high energy prices pushed up production costs. District labor markets remained tight, although recent layoffs appeared to have eased labor shortages somewhat. Wage pressures remained largely subdued. Retail prices edged down due to heavy discounting, while prices for petroleum-based manufacturing materials continued to rise.
