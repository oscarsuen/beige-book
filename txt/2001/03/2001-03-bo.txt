The pace of economic activity is slowing in the First District but, for the most part, growth continues.  Retailers cite weaker results in the past few months than before the holiday season.  While a majority of contacted manufacturers report growth in sales or orders, they also cite signs of weakness.  Both retailers and manufacturers say rising energy prices are raising costs, but they report very few increases in their own selling prices.  Contacts in business services industries--software, information technology, and personnel supply--report slower demand than when last contacted in November.  Commercial real estate respondents say markets are strong but appear to be weakening.
Retail respondents are holding employment levels steady.  Wages continue to rise at a 3 to 6 percent pace.  Most contacts report that store prices are steady.  While hotel room rates continue to rise, the rate of increase has slowed.  Across the board, retailers say that higher energy costs are raising overhead, but productivity gains are holding down total costs.  Looking forward, the mood of retailers has turned cautious.  While all retail respondents expect weak economic growth during the first half of 2001, most say they are continuing with previously planned expansions of their operations.
Utility and transportation costs are up from a year ago, in some cases considerably.  Contacts also report paying more for petroleum-based inputs, chemicals, and metals.  Selling prices remain mostly flat or rising at a low single-digit rate.  Many respondents indicate that they cannot raise prices for fear of losing business.  Most manufacturers report little net change in U.S. employment, although one-quarter of the sample plan deep cuts.  Some contacts indicate that the number of vacancies has fallen for salaried technical personnel.  Based on current trends, most contacts expect this year's wage and salary increases to be on par with last year's, although some expect a slight moderation.
Capital spending plans are mixed and reflect some caution.  For example, one manufacturer is putting some projects on temporary hold.  Another plans to subcontract out some production in order to avoid making capital expenditures in economic uncertainty.  Still others say they will focus on leveraging the capital they have, rather than incurring new costs.
