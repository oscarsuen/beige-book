A majority of Federal Reserve Districts reported                 sluggish to modest economic growth in February, while others generally                 reported mixed conditions. Growth was noted by Boston, New York,                 Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Economic                 conditions were mixed in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and                 Minneapolis, and St. Louis reported noticeably slower economic                 activity.
Consumer spending rose slightly in most Districts                 in January and February as retailers offered deep discounts on                 winter merchandise. Auto sales were generally steady, but below                 last year's rate. Manufacturing activity continued to decline                 in most of the nation, although in the Boston and Richmond Districts                 manufacturers reported improvement. Commercial real estate activity                 eased in most of the Districts reporting on that sector, but vacancy                 rates remain mostly steady and rents have been level or rising.                 Home building activity rose somewhat in New York, Richmond, Atlanta,                 Chicago, and Minneapolis, but declined in St. Louis, mainly because                 of bad weather. Agricultural conditions in the Richmond and Dallas                 Districts were adversely affected by dry weather. Low grain prices                 and high costs for farm inputs have negatively affected farm finances                 in the major agricultural regions of the country. Oil and gas                 drilling have increased in response to higher prices, but mining                 activity has been cut back in the wake of slackening demand for                 mine output. Bank lending has been sluggish except for an increase                 in home mortgage refinancing. Banks in some regions across the                 country have tightened credit standards.
Although labor markets remain tight, over half of                 the Federal Reserve Districts--Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis,                 Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco--noted some signs                 of easing. Demand for manufacturing workers has been declining,                 and recently, demand for construction workers and information                 technology workers has softened. Demand remains strong for clerical                 workers in a variety of industries and for health care workers.                 Employers reported some easing in wage pressures, but they have                 seen increases in health benefit costs. Higher prices for energy,                 especially natural gas, were noted in nearly all Districts, but                 price pressures for many other products do not appear to have                 increased.
Auto sales generally declined in the first two months                 of this year compared with last year, although several Districts                 reported that sales have improved from December. Auto dealers'                 inventories were described as high throughout the nation, and                 manufacturers were extending incentives to boost sales.
Tourism activity has held up in most of the Districts                 that reported on this sector. Richmond indicated that business                 was strong at ski and shore resorts. Atlanta reported increased                 occupancy rates at hotels in Florida as did San Francisco for                 hotels in California and Hawaii. Minneapolis reported solid winter                 tourism activity. However, Boston reported unexpectedly weak growth                 in tourism in New England.
Several Reserve Banks reported high inventories                 among the manufacturers in their Districts. Cleveland and Chicago                 noted excess inventories of steel. Dallas and San Francisco reported                 high inventories of telecommunications equipment. Kansas City                 indicated that inventories were above plan for most manufacturers                 in the District. Manufacturing firms were reported to be trimming                 capital spending in Boston, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San                 Francisco.
Reports on residential construction were generally                 positive. New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas                 reported increases in home building, although gains were modest.                 Residential construction activity was steady in Philadelphia and                 Kansas City and down in St. Louis. Adverse weather was blamed                 for the slowdown in St. Louis.
Sales of new and existing homes continue to be fairly                 brisk in many regions, bolstered by lower mortgage interest rates.                 Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis reported stepped-up                 home sales. Such sales were steady in the Philadelphia District,                 and down in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. New York                 and Philadelphia reported steady price appreciation for both new                 and existing homes, but Atlanta noted some price concessions by                 builders in its District.
Consumer lending decreased in Philadelphia, Atlanta,                 and St. Louis. Chicago noted an increase in credit card usage                 and outstanding balances. Mortgage lending for home purchases                 rose in New York and Chicago, fell in Philadelphia and Atlanta,                 and was steady in Kansas City. As mortgage rates have fallen,                 refinancing activity was reported to have picked up in New York,                 Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City.
Commercial banks in several Districts have tightened                 credit standards. New York, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas,                 and San Francisco noted that banks in those Districts had tightened                 standards and stepped up monitoring of borrowers, especially for                 business loans and commercial real estate loans. Banks in the                 St. Louis District indicated that nonperforming loans have increased,                 but banks in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts reported that loan                 quality has been steady.
Employers reported some easing of wage pressures                 in Boston, New York, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Employers in                 San Francisco have reduced or eliminated signing bonuses. Despite                 easing wage pressures, employee benefit costs, especially for                 health insurance, continue to rise. New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis,                 and San Francisco indicated that businesses in their Districts                 are facing large increases.
