The District economy shows several signs of slowing. Sales during the recent holiday season have been weak and below expectations, leaving many retailers with overstocked inventories. Early winter weather hurt. New and used vehicle sales are also slow, and inventories are high. Declines in demand have affected many industries; however, these declines have helped to ease labor market tightness somewhat. Many firms' profits are being squeezed by high fuel costs. Although new housing construction continues to slow, home sales have recently picked up in some areas. Loan demand has softened somewhat, while loan growth has been very mild. Several makers of fertilizer have stopped producing and, instead, have been selling their natural gas stocks on the market to boost profits.
Car dealers report that sales during the last two months of 2000 are down more than 5 percent on average from a year earlier. Used car sales, in particular, have experienced the largest decline. An early blast of winter weather, coupled with economic uncertainty and an anticipation of lower interest rates, are believed to have kept buyersaway from showrooms. About two-thirds of the dealers note that current inventories are above desired levels. Most contacts are cautiously optimistic that sales in the first quarter of 2001 will rebound because they plan to offer more incentives—such as a wider use of rebates—to help boost sales and reduce inventories.
Weak demand for automobiles has caused two manufacturers to idle several plants for at least one week. The local steel industry continues to weaken, with several producers going out of business in the past few months because of lower demand and foreign competition. The wholesale trade industry in northeast Arkansas and the furniture manufacturing industry in northeast Mississippi are both experiencing reduced profits because of slower demand. The District's apparel industry continues to shrink, as a Fruit of the Loom plant in Arkansas closes to eliminate excess production capacity.
Employment growth has been boosted by several firms expanding and relocating to the District. Memphis, for example, is increasing its status as a regional distribution hub, as a food distributor constructs a new warehouse and distribution center that will create 600 new jobs. A contact at a credit card company notes that it will employ more than 1,000 new workers at its global technology center in the St. Louis area during 2001. The District's high-tech sector continues to be volatile: Companies moving to the Louisville, Memphis and northwest Arkansas areas will create nearly 1,000 jobs in the coming months; several Internet companies currently in the St. Louis, Memphis and Louisville areas, however, have already cut their workforces, eliminating more than 600 jobs in the past two months. Despite slower demand in other sectors, General Electric is anticipating a strong year, as it plans to roll out more than 40 new products this year at its Kentucky Appliance Park.
Residential construction continues to slow, with permits down from their month- and year-earlier levels in all District metropolitan areas. Builders, however, have expressed optimism about construction activity in 2001 because of expectations of lower mortgage rates. Nonresidential construction has been mixed, with pockets ofactivity in some areas, such as Little Rock, and substantial slowing of the market in others, such as St. Louis. As a result of the slower residential and nonresidential construction, fewer contractors are experiencing backlogs.
Low water levels and ice on the Mississippi River have made travel difficult for barges and tugboats, hampering cargo shipments of commodities such as corn, soybeans and wheat. These conditions have also caused some barges to run aground earlier in the season than usual.
