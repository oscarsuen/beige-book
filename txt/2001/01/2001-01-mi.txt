Economic growth in the Ninth District is weakening. Manufacturing levels and mining production are decreasing. Consumer spending is flat, and housing construction and agriculture continue to grow at a slow rate. Some signs of strength persist: The energy, tourism and commercial real estate sectors are expanding at a solid pace. Labor markets are still tight, although several layoffs were announced. Wages are increasing at a moderate pace. Overall price increases are moderate, but significant increases are noted for energy, residential rents, health care and package delivery.
Homebuilding increased slightly from the last report. Housing units authorized were up 2 percent in the district for the three-month period ending in November compared with a year earlier. Housing permits in theMinneapolis-St. Paul area were expected to finish 2000 at near record levels, and favorable mortgage interest rates are boosting home sales, according to a mortgage consultant. In contrast, almost 50 percent ofrespondents in the Minneapolis Fed's annual business conditions survey conducted in November expect housing starts to decrease in 2001.
An early start to winter recreation activities has boosted tourism. A ski resort in Montana reports bookings for January and February up 4 percent from a year ago. Winter sports participation in South Dakota is up 25 percent in December compared with a year earlier. An official reports that winter tourism in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was ahead of last year for November and December, but softer during the holidays.
Still, several companies are looking for new employees. A new high-tech company in Rapid City, S.D., plans to hire 100 employees in the two years. The construction of a poultry litter-fired power plant in western Minnesota will require 300 workers. Some manufacturers are expanding outside the district due to a lack of available labor, according to a bank director.
Wages continue to increase at a moderate pace. About three of five respondents to the Minneapolis Fed's business conditions survey expect a modest increase in wages for their communities in 2001. A December survey of manufacturers in the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin shows that about 48 percent of respondents have raised wages over the past two months compared with 53 percent a year ago.
Overall price increases are moderate, but significant increases are noted for energy, apartment rental rates, health care and package delivery. The cost to heat homes this winter has doubled in many district locations. Apartment rental rates increased 11 percent in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in December compared with a year earlier. A hospital in La Crosse is increasing rates by an average of 12 percent over a year ago, the largest single increase in over a decade. Two major package delivery companies are raising rates up to 5 percent. A December St. Cloud State University Quarterly Business Report survey showed that 23 percent of respondents in central Minnesota noted increases in product prices, down from 29 percent a year ago.
