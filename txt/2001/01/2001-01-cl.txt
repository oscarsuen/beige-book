Growth in economic activity in the Fourth District remained at the same slow rate described in our last report. The steel industry in particular continues to show a great deal of strain as a result of strong foreign competitionand weaker domestic demand. Retail stores experienced a slower-than-expected holiday season, as consumer spending remained soft. However, labor markets have remained fairly buoyant, although less so than they had been earlier in the year.
Although sales of new vehicles through the first three quarters of 2000 were better than or just slightly below the record pace of 1999 for District dealers, sales slowed in this year's last quarter compared to 1999's. Moreover, it was reported that sales worsened as the quarter progressed. Finally, results for each dealer varied widely depending upon incentives offered by manufacturers. A current concern for area dealers is the bloated state of their inventories. Most reported having a 75-day or greater inventory, yet a 60-day inventory is preferred. Weak sales are anticipated to continue for the next couple of months.
According to several union contacts, wage growth in current contracts has increased, most in the range of 3.5% to 4%--a rate still below the 4.7% that total private hourly earnings rose in the fourth quarter. While benefitsgrowth appears to be concentrated mostly in pensions, health care remains an area of concern. Cost shifting, co-payments, and stop-loss arrangements have increased the costs borne by union members.
Credit standards and delinquency rates have not changed significantly, but banks are watching their customers' ability to make payments more closely. Also, banks are paying more attention to the value of the collateral for loans.
District homebuilders continued to report little change in business conditions. Some are concerned, however, about how much work they will have in 2001. At this time last year, many homebuilders had nearly twice as many projects scheduled for the upcoming 12 months as they do now; of course, last year was exceptionally strong.
Over the last month, fuel costs have stabilized and even gone down slightly for some companies. But even with lower fuel prices, unusually bad winter weather has resulted in rising costs anyway. Most contacts expect the decline in shipping activity to continue into the first quarter of 2001.
