Fifth District economic growth continued to slow in December and early January. Seasonally-adjusted retail sales fell at automobile dealerships, and were weak at other stores, as sagging consumer confidence and unusually cold weather reduced spending. Service providers reported lower revenues and employment.
Manufacturing output continued to slip somewhat in December and new orders dropped sharply, but manufacturers remained optimistic that conditions will improve by midyear. In the real estate and financial sectors, lower mortgage rates boosted December activity but lower consumer confidence damped expectations of business activity in coming months. Turning to District labor markets, strong wage gains continued in retail, but wage growth was moderate elsewhere. Consumer prices continued to rise at a modest pace.
Commercial Realtors reported softer growth in leasing and construction activity in recent weeks. Realtors in the District of Columbia said that the demand for office space had slowed in part because a number of struggling dot-com companies had recently backed out of rental contracts. Commercial Realtors in Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas reported substantially slower growth in all types of commercial construction, with very few speculative projects currently underway. On a stronger note, contacts in Raleigh, N.C., and Columbia, S.C., reported a pickup in leasing activity in the retail sector and they said that the supply of Class A office space remained tight. Commercial rents across the District were generally stable to moderately higher.
