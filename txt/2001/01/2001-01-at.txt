The District economy expanded modestly during December amid               further signs of economic deceleration. As expected, holiday sales               results did not achieve the high levels of growth experienced last               year, and the outlook for the first quarter was soft. Single-family               construction and home sales remained sluggish, and nonresidential               construction declined in most parts of the District. Manufacturing               weakened, and the near-term outlook was for further reductions in               factory activity. Overall loan demand, credit availability, and               loan quality were at relatively healthy levels but with reports               of stricter lending standards and slowing demand in some areas.               Reports from the tourism and hospitality sector were generally positive.               Labor market conditions eased slightly.
Nonresidential construction declined in most parts of the District, with the notable exceptions of Alabama and Georgia. The multifamily sector experienced a slight rebound in permit issuance during the fourth quarter. Markets were expected to remain reasonably balanced going forward.
Competition and lower demand growth continued to hold potential price increases in check for many District businesses. Most contacts said that wage increases had not been passed on to customers in the form of higher prices. Lumber prices remained depressed throughout the region. Some reports noted increases in costs of copper, aluminum, and plastic inputs. Medical costs continued to increase, and insurance premiums have been rising at double-digit rates. Some price increases were reported because of higher fuel costs.
