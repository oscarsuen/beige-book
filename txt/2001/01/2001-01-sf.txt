Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicated continued expansion in most District states, although there are signs of slowing in several key sectors and of easing in tight labor markets. Contacts reported that holiday season retail sales were mixed, falling below expectations in many states. Conditions in the District manufacturing sector softened, and respondents noted some accumulation of inventories. Conditions in the District agricultural sector weakened further in recent weeks, as sales softened and prices remained low. Real estate and construction activity remained strong, especially in California and Hawaii. District contacts reported weaker loan demand and diminished credit availability for new office construction and for high-tech firms with weak profits. High energy prices reportedly have driven up costs for the manufacturing, transportation, and agricultural sectors. However, producers noted that competitive pressures have limited their ability to pass those higher costs on to consumers.
Numerous District contacts cited concerns about energy shortages and costs. Respondents noted adverse impacts from soaring electricity and natural gas prices on the agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing sectors. For example, the costs of harvesting seafood, drying foods, and transporting and manufacturing goods have risen. Several agricultural, manufacturing, and retail sector respondents indicated that competitive pressures continued to limit their ability to raise prices of final goods and services. Respondents expect higher energy costs to affect retail prices and construction costs in the year ahead. Despite electric power and natural gas shortages and steep increases in energy costs, relatively few District contacts have revised their energy procurement strategies.
District contacts indicated that holiday season Internet sales increased compared to 1999. Increased sales were attributed to more website visitors, increased confidence in Internet transactions, and more frequent use of the Internet by traditional retailers. Despite the strong growth, holiday Internet sales fell below expectations.
Manufacturers expressed widespread concern about the negative effects of higher energy costs. Higher energy prices have driven up costs of producing most manufactured goods. One Nevada contact indicated that small business energy costs doubled in December, even with moderate weather. Production disruptions were noted: For example, one aluminum plant in the Pacific Northwest shut down its smelter operations because it was more profitable to resell the electricity under contract than to operate the plant.
