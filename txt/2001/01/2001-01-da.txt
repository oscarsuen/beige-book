Overall Eleventh District economic activity continued to decelerate in December and early January. Manufacturing activity declined, with a considerable drop in demand for some industries. Weaker sales growth was reported in the service sector; demand for business services and retail sales decelerated. Construction and real estate activity also slowed, with a substantial slowing in the demand for residential building. Financial service firms said activity was slightly slower and, while credit quality remains stable, most respondents reported continued tightening of credit standards. The energy industry remains a bright spot, with international activity picking up, but a lack of labor and machinery is constraining drilling activity. Freezing weather hampered agricultural conditions.
Spot prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil has declined nearly $10 (more than 25 percent) per barrel since peaking in late November, but remained strong by standards set over the past two years. Crude inventories, which have been very tight, increased slightly in December and are expected to normalize. Oil product prices are generally following the price of crude downward. Ethylene prices fell throughout the second half of 2000 and are expected to continue falling. Feedstock prices for ethylene and propylene have reached unprofitable levels as producers have watched in horror as natural gas prices doubled from what was thought to be an incredibly high $5 per Mcf up to $10. (The highest prices ever reached-even when adjusted for inflation.) A number of plants that convert natural gas into other products have been shutting down, reducing U.S. methanol capacity by 50 percent and ammonia capacity by one-third. Ethylene capacity has been reduced by 10 to 15 percent.
Glass producers noted higher fuel costs, which some firms are passing forward. Business service firms said that fees have been rising but not as fast as their costs. Transportation service firms have increased prices and fares to cover rising fuel costs. Prices are rising for energy-related labor, products and services.
