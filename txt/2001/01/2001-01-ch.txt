Economic activity in the Seventh District               slowed further in December, in part due to severe winter weather               adversely impacting virtually all economic sectors. Retailers reported               that brutal weather kept store traffic down and, with few exceptions,               holiday sales fell below merchants' expectations. Builders and Realtors               also cited the weather as contributing to a general slowdown in               construction and real estate activity. Recent softening in the auto               industry contributed to a further slowing of the District's overall               manufacturing activity. Lenders reported moderating growth in business               loan volumes while many noted a discernible increase in mortgage               refinancing applications. Labor markets, while remaining very tight,               appeared to ease somewhat as 2000 drew to a close, alleviating some               worker shortages and wage pressures. With the notable exception               of heating costs, price pressures appeared to ease slightly as economic               conditions softened. Many contacts noted a discernible drop in both               consumer and business confidence since our last report. Contacts               were more optimistic after the Federal Reserve's unexpected rate               cut in early January, but remained cautious in their business expectations               for the first half of the year.
