The Tenth District economy slowed in December. Manufacturing activity fell, residential building declined further, and sizable layoffs were announced at several district firms. Auto sales also dropped sharply, and overall retail sales were sluggish during the holiday season, despite heavy discounting. On the positive side, commercial construction activity remained solid, and energy activity continued to rise. In the farm economy, poor pasture conditions have limited expansion of cattle breeding herds. District labor markets remained tight, but wage pressures appeared to ease somewhat, especially in the retail sector. Prices were flat, except for declines in some manufacturing materials.
