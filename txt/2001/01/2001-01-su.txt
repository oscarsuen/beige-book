Reports from Federal Reserve Districts indicate                 that economic growth slowed in December, easing labor shortages                 somewhat and limiting price pressures for finished goods and services.                 Most districts reported a further deceleration in growth from                 the previous survey. Philadelphia reported an actual decline in                 activity, while Cleveland said that economic growth remained at                 the same slow rate as in the previous report. New York and San                 Francisco indicated that growth remained solid but showed some                 signs of softening.
Despite heavy discounting, nearly all districts reported lackluster                 retail sales growth during the holiday season. Automobile sales                 slowed substantially and most districts reported a sizable buildup                 of dealer stocks. All districts reported weaker manufacturing                 activity in December. Residential construction cooled in most                 districts but remained strong in New York and San Francisco. Commercial                 real estate activity also showed some signs of slowing. The tourism                 industry reported a strong start to the winter season, but other                 service activity weakened, particularly for trucking and other                 transport. Activity in the energy sector expanded as fast as drillers                 could find workers and rigs. Banks did not report any deterioration                 in credit quality but kept a watchful eye over their loans.
Labor markets eased somewhat but remained tight. Layoffs in                 a wide variety of industries were announced in most districts.                 However, business contacts expected laid-off workers to be quickly                 reabsorbed due to strong pent-up demand for labor at other firms.                 In most districts, wage pressures were similar to or slightly                 less intense than those in the previous survey. Prices for most                 manufactured goods were flat to down despite higher costs for                 energy and other inputs. Consumer product prices were constrained                 by heavy holiday discounting.
Automobile sales in all districts reporting on such activity                 were characterized as either weak or slowing. Sales of domestic                 cars and light trucks were reported to be especially weak in the                 Philadelphia and Chicago districts. St. Louis noted that used                 car dealerships experienced the largest decline in sales. Dealers                 in the Kansas City district had difficulties moving all makes                 and models of motor vehicles. Inventories of unsold cars throughout                 the country were high, and in most districts expectations for                 auto sales in coming months remained subdued.
High input costs, the strong dollar, and weaker domestic demand                 were cited the most often as reasons for the slowdown in factory                 activity. Boston, Richmond, and St. Louis reported that higher                 input costs were squeezing profits for some firms. Half the districts                 also mentioned widespread concern among manufacturers about higher                 energy costs. Some fertilizer, chemical, and smelting plants in                 the St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco districts                 have even shut down in order to resell their electricity or natural                 gas supplies on the open market. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond,                 Atlanta, and Kansas City reported that heavy import competition,                 due largely to the strength of the dollar, was hampering manufacturing                 sales. Atlanta also reported that uncertainty about the U.S. stock                 market was adversely affecting firms' capital expenditure plans.
There were also signs of slowing in commercial real estate activity                 in some districts. Commercial construction slowed in the Dallas,                 Richmond, and Atlanta districts, and was described as mixed in                 the St. Louis and Cleveland districts. Commercial building remained                 solid in the Kansas City district. New York and Richmond reported                 that contraction by dot-com enterprises has helped free up some                 office space, although the office market in the New York district                 remains very tight. Shortages of office space were also reported                 in parts of the Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts.
Activity in other service industries was generally down. Demand                 for trucking services fell considerably in the New York and Cleveland                 districts, and was down slightly in the Dallas district. Meanwhile,                 trucking firms' fuel, insurance, and labor costs continued to                 rise, resulting in an increase in bankruptcies and truck repossessions                 in the New York district. St. Louis reported a slowdown in barge                 traffic on the Mississippi River due to low water levels. Richmond                 and Dallas reported that revenues fell at most business service                 firms. In contrast, revenues were up in the Boston district's                 insurance industry.
There were no new reports of decreases in credit quality, but                 banks generally continued to tighten credit standards and said                 they were keeping a watchful eye on the financial condition of                 their borrowers. Banks in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta,                 Chicago, and Dallas districts reported they were continuing to                 tighten their credit standards. Banks in many districts also said                 they were monitoring credit quality carefully to detect any deterioration.                 Bankers in the Chicago district reported they were keeping an                 especially close eye on loans to retail and manufacturing sectors,                 while bankers in the Richmond district said they were paying special                 attention to loans to cyclical industries.
In the farm economy, the onset of winter weather across the                 country has had mixed effects. Minneapolis reported that moisture                 from heavy snowfalls has benefited the winter wheat crop and is                 expected to reduce the likelihood of drought conditions in the                 coming growing season. However, severe winter weather also contributed                 to a worsening in pasture conditions for livestock and an increased                 use of alternative forages in the Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas                 City, and Dallas districts. The alternative supplies seem to be                 generally available except for some reports of hay shortages in                 the Dallas district.
Wage pressures in most districts either held steady or decreased                 slightly in response to the easing in labor markets. Chicago,                 Dallas, Kansas City, and San Francisco all reported some moderation                 in overall wage pressures. New York described wage pressures as                 strong but steady, while Minneapolis reported that wages continued                 to increase at a moderate pace. Despite the overall slowdown in                 economic growth, a number of districts reported strong wage pressures                 for certain types of workers, including information technology                 workers in the Boston district, retail workers in the Richmond                 district, construction workers in the San Francisco district,                 and union workers in the Cleveland district.
Price pressures for consumer goods were subdued, while prices                 for most manufactured goods were flat to down despite higher input                 costs. Extensive discounting by retailers during the holiday shopping                 season helped constrain consumer prices in most districts. Retail                 prices increased at a slower rate in the Richmond district, held                 steady in the Boston district, and declined somewhat in the Kansas                 City and Dallas districts.
Manufacturers in many districts reported that their input costs                 rose in December, especially for energy, but that they were unable                 to pass these cost increases on to customers due to intense foreign                 and domestic competition and slowing demand. The most notable                 reports of downward pressure on selling prices were for steel                 firms in the Cleveland and Chicago districts and for a wide variety                 of manufacturing firms in the Dallas district, including producers                 of metals, cement and concrete, paper, and lumber. In the service-producing                 sector, telecommunications firms in the Dallas district reported                 their prices were falling rapidly, but insurance firms in the                 Boston district said that reduced price competition had enabled                 them to raise premiums to more profitable levels.
