On balance, economic activity in the Seventh             District slowed further in September and early October. Reports indicated             that the tragic events of September 11 had an immediate negative impact,             but many related business disruptions had been alleviated by the weekend.             Consumer spending continued to soften, with sales of nondurable goods             doing better than sales of most durable goods and services. Residential             construction and real estate markets slowed some, but low mortgage             rates kept buyers in the market. Commercial real estate markets weakened             noticeably, with businesses becoming more uncertain about investment             plans. Manufacturing activity continued to slow, and increased business             caution further dampened capital expenditures. Lending activity was             mixed, with demand for business loans falling and mortgage refinancing             surging. Labor demand softened and there were few reports of intensifying             upward wage pressures. There were virtually no reports of upward price             pressures and several reports of falling transaction prices. Most             contacts were satisfied with their current inventory levels. The fall             crop harvest was generally progressing well, with good yields reported             in the southern and eastern parts of the District, though there were             indications of "spotty" and "disappointing" yields in the north and             west.
Overall lending activity was mixed in recent weeks, as uncertainty               about the near-term economic outlook increased. Bankers suggested               that business lending slowed as firms appeared to be putting major               decisions on hold. In addition, reports indicated that some businesses               were weighing future capital spending against increased investment               in security. Loan officers at some banks were reportedly "spending               more time combing through existing accounts than mining for new               business." Commercial loan quality deteriorated further in recent               weeks, but there were no reported changes in standards and terms               for business loans. On the household side, mortgage refinancing               activity surged in recent weeks as homeowners took advantage of               lower interest rates. One banker noted that refinancing activity               was near record levels and would most likely exceed them in coming               weeks. Demand for new mortgages was reportedly mixed, but relatively               strong. One lender stated that "if you have the need, there is no               better time" to take out a mortgage. Credit quality continued to               deteriorate slightly, with delinquencies increasing on many types               of loans, including mortgages and home-equity loans.
Labor markets softened further after September 11. Year-over-year               increases in initial unemployment insurance claims surged in the               weeks following the attacks. Tourism and travel firms in some larger               metro areas were quick to trim payrolls as business fell off significantly               after September 11. One aircraft engineering firm in the District               has sharply cut back its hiring needs and has begun laying off workers.               Some reports suggested that retailers' fall hiring will be slower               than in recent years as expectations for the holiday shopping season               weakened. At least one national retail chain was already reported               to be shedding workers. Some high-tech services firms continued               to lay off workers and at least one also cut top executives' pay.               There were reports of automakers shedding or considering layoffs               of some white-collar workers in a new attempt to cut costs. A national               survey showed that fourth-quarter hiring plans of Midwest employers               were the lowest since 1994. There were no reports of intensifying               upward pressure on wages.
