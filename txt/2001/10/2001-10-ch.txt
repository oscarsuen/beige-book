On balance, economic activity in the Seventh             District slowed further in September and early October. Reports indicated             that the tragic events of September 11 had an immediate negative impact,             but many related business disruptions had been alleviated by the weekend.             Consumer spending continued to soften, with sales of nondurable goods             doing better than sales of most durable goods and services. Residential             construction and real estate markets slowed some, but low mortgage             rates kept buyers in the market. Commercial real estate markets weakened             noticeably, with businesses becoming more uncertain about investment             plans. Manufacturing activity continued to slow, and increased business             caution further dampened capital expenditures. Lending activity was             mixed, with demand for business loans falling and mortgage refinancing             surging. Labor demand softened and there were few reports of intensifying             upward wage pressures. There were virtually no reports of upward price             pressures and several reports of falling transaction prices. Most             contacts were satisfied with their current inventory levels. The fall             crop harvest was generally progressing well, with good yields reported             in the southern and eastern parts of the District, though there were             indications of "spotty" and "disappointing" yields in the north and             west.
