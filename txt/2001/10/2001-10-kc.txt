The Tenth District economy weakened in September             and early October. Retail sales dropped immediately following the             terrorist attacks and recovered only partially in the next several             weeks. In addition, the slump in manufacturing worsened, residential             construction activity slowed, and commercial real estate activity             declined. Energy activity also fell somewhat after increasing most             of the year. In the farm economy, fall crop yields were mixed and             weaker cattle prices trimmed profits for cattle feeders. District             labor markets eased, as previously scheduled job cuts took effect             and more layoffs were announced. Wage pressures remained minimal outside             of a few skilled occupations. Retail prices and prices for construction             and manufacturing materials were largely stable, while manufacturing             output prices edged down.
Retail sales declined from the previous survey and were below year-ago               levels in most of the district. Many stores shut down on the day               of the terrorist attacks and most experienced slower than normal               sales the rest of that week. Sales had recovered somewhat by the               following weekend but remained below normal in most places through               early October. High-end retailers generally suffered the biggest               declines in sales, while large discount stores and grocery stores               fared better. Retailers expect activity to remain somewhat subdued               through the holiday shopping season. Motor vehicle sales in September               were strong in some areas due to attractive financing packages,               but remained soft in others due to consumers' unease about the economy.               Dealers expect sales to weaken once the consumer incentives come               to an end.
District factory activity weakened again after showing some signs               of improvement in August. A greater percentage of firms reported               year-over-year declines in production, shipments, and most other               indicators of factory activity. In addition, more manufacturers               reported declines in employment than in previous surveys. Layoffs               were announced in a variety of industries, but especially among               aircraft manufacturers and parts suppliers. Several firms mentioned               that the biggest immediate impact of the terrorist acts was a reduction               in executive air travel, which they feared could disrupt sales.               Capital expenditures at district plants continued to fall along               with expectations of future activity. Most plants were trimming               inventories in September and planned to continue doing so. No significant               material shortages were reported, and supplier delivery times were               little changed despite some disruptions immediately following the               terrorist attacks.
Bankers report that loans decreased and deposits increased since               the last survey, reducing loan-deposit ratios. Demand fell for commercial               and industrial loans, consumer loans, and commercial real estate               loans. A number of bankers attributed the weaker demand for these               categories to increased caution on the part of borrowers, some of               whom are making a greater effort to pay down their loans. On the               deposit side, increases in demand deposits outweighed declines in               large CDs. All respondent banks reduced their prime lending rates               since the last survey, and almost all banks decreased their consumer               lending rates. A few banks tightened their lending standards, citing               the slowdown in the economy and the increase in uncertainty.
Energy activity in the district declined in September and early               October. The region's count of active oil and gas drilling rigs               continued to fall from a 14-year high established in July, reaching               a six-month low in the first week of October. Some producers attributed               the decline in drilling to the steep fall in natural gas prices               since last winter, which has discouraged the drilling of marginal               wells. District sources expected natural gas prices to remain fairly               low through 2002, but believe long-run prospects for the energy               industry are still favorable.
Fall crop yields were mixed across the district, and district cattle               feeders suffered some decline in profits. With the fall harvest               almost complete, corn and soybean yields in the southern part of               the district were below normal due to adverse weather over the summer.               Elsewhere, yields were average or better. Rainfall came in time               for planting of the district's winter wheat crop, which is generally               ahead of schedule. Large supplies of market-ready cattle put downward               pressure on finished cattle prices, trimming profits for district               cattle feeders. Bankers reported that small business activity in               rural areas was sluggish, continuing the slowdown that began prior               to the terrorist bombings.
District labor markets eased in September and early October, as               sizable job cuts were announced and previously announced layoffs               took effect in many parts of the district. Employers were reported               to be taking more time in screening and hiring new workers, with               many having a waiting list of applicants for the first time in several               years. Several retailers said they would not be hiring as many temporary               holiday workers as in previous years. Worker shortages persisted,               however, for nurses and skilled construction trades. Wage pressures               remained minimal outside of these fields. Several contacts reported               that there has been a definite shift in unions' focus from wages               to working conditions over the last six months. Retail prices were               flat for most items, although several stores lowered prices to clear               excess inventory. Most store managers expect flat prices through               the remainder of the year. In the manufacturing sector, input prices               were flat and output prices fell slightly. Both input and output               prices are expected to edge up in coming months. Builders reported               that prices for most construction materials were stable.
