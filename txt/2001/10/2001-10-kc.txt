The Tenth District economy weakened in September             and early October. Retail sales dropped immediately following the             terrorist attacks and recovered only partially in the next several             weeks. In addition, the slump in manufacturing worsened, residential             construction activity slowed, and commercial real estate activity             declined. Energy activity also fell somewhat after increasing most             of the year. In the farm economy, fall crop yields were mixed and             weaker cattle prices trimmed profits for cattle feeders. District             labor markets eased, as previously scheduled job cuts took effect             and more layoffs were announced. Wage pressures remained minimal outside             of a few skilled occupations. Retail prices and prices for construction             and manufacturing materials were largely stable, while manufacturing             output prices edged down.
