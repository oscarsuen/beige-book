Contacts reported that economic activity slowed during the survey period of September through early October, as the negative repercussions of the September 11 terrorist attacks added to underlying weakness in many sectors.  Upward pressure on wages and prices was limited overall, with price declines or discounts noted for gasoline, travel-related services, and some categories of retail goods.  Retail and travel spending dropped precipitously during the week of September 11, then recovered noticeably but generally remained below respondents' pre-attack expectations.  Production and employment in most manufacturing sectors fell, and firms held back on investment.  Ample supply and low prices were reported for most agricultural products.  Demand for real estate and construction activity fell in most areas, with some projects facing financing and insurance obstacles.  Loan demand at banks weakened somewhat, especially for business loans.
Demand for services by consumers and businesses was quite weak, as spending on travel and tourism plummeted during the weeks following the attacks.  In Hawaii, tourist visits and spending were about 25 to 30 percent below normal.  Airlines in general reduced flights by about 15 to 20 percent at District airports.  Hotel occupancy rates, which already were running below year-earlier levels prior to September 11, fell by half or more during the week immediately following the attacks; by month-end, they had improved but remained quite low, with reported rates ranging from 10 to 50 percent below normal.  Advertisers and media outlets saw reduced demand for advertising space and commercial time during the week of the attacks, which exacerbated pre-existing weakness in that sector.  Firms in all of these sectors laid off large numbers of employees.
