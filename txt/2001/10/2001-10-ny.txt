Home sales in and around New York City have slowed               drastically since the last report, and both apartment prices and               rents have fallen by an estimated 10 percent. In general, contacts               note that the high end of the market has been the most affected.               Contrary to initial post-attack expectations, Manhattan's office               market has not tightened--availability rates at the end of September               were slightly higher than a month earlier. Hotels, taxi drivers,               and Broadway theaters experienced a steep falloff in business in               mid-September, but activity has reportedly recovered somewhat in               the weeks since. Finally, bankers again report weaker loan demand,               tighter credit standards, and moderately higher delinquency rates               in the latest survey, taken in early October.
Discount chains, which have a very limited presence               in New York City, report that sales in the region were only modestly               below plan, boosted by home entertainment merchandise (DVDs, etc.)               and security-related merchandise (alarms, etc). One contact notes               some shift in business from weekends to weekdays and says that consumers               have grown increasingly budget-conscious in recent weeks.
Major retail chains report that some stores closed               for most of the day on September 11 but that all re-opened on the               following day. Scattered delivery and shipping delays were reported--mostly               at border crossings--but no major problems were reported. A large               number of retail outlets in the World Trade Center complex were               destroyed, and virtually all major stores in Lower Manhattan were               closed for at least a week--a major department store and a leading               electronics store remain closed indefinitely.
Housing markets in and around New York City have               clearly weakened further since the last report. A leading Manhattan               rental real estate firm reports that the market has slowed significantly               in recent months but notes that it is difficult to assess the impact               of the terrorist attack versus cyclical forces. After accounting               for increased concessions--such as a free month--Manhattan rents               (north of Canal Street) appear to be averaging about 10 percent               lower than a year ago. In Lower Manhattan, demand has fallen off               sharply, and it is difficult to assess current market rents.
Similarly, contacts in the apartment appraisal               and brokerage industries note that co-op and condo transactions               ground to a halt during the week of the attack and have edged up               only moderately in recent weeks, while prices have fallen by roughly               10 percent. Even prices stipulated in a number of signed contracts               have been renegotiated. As in the rental market, Lower Manhattan               is said to be particularly sluggish, but market conditions appear               to be holding up relatively well uptown, with a few reports of multiple               offers on apartments.
Homebuilders in northern New Jersey report some               softening at the high end of the market. Some buyers are said to               have shelved deals on construction not yet begun (pre-contract).               However, one contact still notes that there remains a shortage of               housing, and people that need to move are still buying, though typically               with fewer amenities. Separately, a realtor in northern New Jersey               reports that there were virtually no sales transacted in the three               weeks following the attack, and that it is difficult to gauge price               trends.
Tourism-related industries experienced a steep               drop-off in activity in September, though there has been some improvement               in early October. Manhattan hotels report that occupancy rates,               which had already been slumping for most of this year, fell 25 percent               below normal in September, and many hotels have slashed room rates.               New York City taxi drivers have reportedly experienced a steep drop-off               in business; income was reported to have fallen by as much as 50               percent in the weeks following the terrorist attack. Broadway theaters               report some rebound in attendance in October, following a dramatic               falloff in mid to late September.
On a more positive note, there are some signs               of stabilization in the region's manufacturing sector. New York               State manufacturers report some pickup in general business conditions               and new orders in September and early October, but express increased               pessimism about the six-month outlook--largely reflecting concern               about the residual effects of the terrorist attack. Manufacturers               continue to report downward price pressures, though to a lesser               extent than in the last report.
