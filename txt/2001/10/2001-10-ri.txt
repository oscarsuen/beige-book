Fifth District economic activity contracted             slightly in September and early October, as consumers pulled back             in the wake of terrorist attacks on September 11. Services and retail             businesses felt the strongest impact. District hotels, airlines, and             travel agencies reported sharply lower revenues. Retailers said that             big-ticket sales tumbled in September, though they rebounded somewhat             in October, as consumers began returning to stores and automobile             dealerships. Manufacturing shipments and new orders were generally             steady in September. Growth in the housing market slowed modestly             in the weeks since our last report, while leasing of commercial properties             continued to trend downward. Price increases remained generally modest             at District businesses. In agriculture, cool, dry weather was favorable             for corn and soybean harvesting, and both were ahead of schedule.
Commercial Realtors across the District reported               that leasing activity was almost "non-existent" during the week               after the attacks. Since then, leasing activity has gradually regained               momentum, but remains below early September levels. The District's               industrial sector remained sluggish and industrial leasing activity               continued to soften--a Northern Virginia Realtor noted that many               firms utilizing industrial space were "belt-tightening" and trying               to "right-size." The office and retail sectors, meanwhile, have               shown resilience in recent weeks. A contact in Columbia, SC, reported               that despite a "depressed" attitude within the business community,               business firms continued to move forward with their office leasing               plans. The demand for Class A office space was generally flat across               the District. In Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia, however,               office space was being acquired for displaced Pentagon employees               and for other federal government workers.
