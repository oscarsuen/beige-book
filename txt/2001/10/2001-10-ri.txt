Fifth District economic activity contracted             slightly in September and early October, as consumers pulled back             in the wake of terrorist attacks on September 11. Services and retail             businesses felt the strongest impact. District hotels, airlines, and             travel agencies reported sharply lower revenues. Retailers said that             big-ticket sales tumbled in September, though they rebounded somewhat             in October, as consumers began returning to stores and automobile             dealerships. Manufacturing shipments and new orders were generally             steady in September. Growth in the housing market slowed modestly             in the weeks since our last report, while leasing of commercial properties             continued to trend downward. Price increases remained generally modest             at District businesses. In agriculture, cool, dry weather was favorable             for corn and soybean harvesting, and both were ahead of schedule.
District retailers reported sharply lower sales in September, particularly               in the week following the September 11 terrorist attacks, but a               number of contacts noted that their sales rebounded somewhat in               early October. Both shopper traffic and big-ticket sales declined               in September. Automobile dealers said customer traffic dropped by               as much as 50 percent immediately after the attacks. However, customers               have returned in the last few weeks, and sales are now running a               little above early September levels, boosted by price and financing               incentives. Big-box retailers told us that their business was back               to normal by the end of September, and some indicated that sales               of basic durable goods had picked up in recent weeks. District grocery               stores noted stronger sales of canned goods and bottled water. In               contrast to rebounding retail activity in many areas, several retailers               in the Charlotte, N.C., area said they were continuing to see a               reduction in customer traffic as banking and airline layoffs continued               in the area. Employment in the retail sector fell moderately in               September, while prices were little changed.
Residential realtors and homebuilders reported generally slower               growth in home sales in September and early October. The uncertainty               created by events of September 11 reduced buyer enthusiasm in some               markets. Realtors in Bel Air, Md., and Beckley, WV, for example,               said that "everything stopped" on September 11, while a realtor               in Greenville, SC, said that his agency had 19 home sales "fall               through" after the attacks. But home sales in many areas continued               to hold or even rise, in part because of lower mortgage rates. A               homebuilder in Landover, Md., said that her agency had been very               busy, while a Realtor in Asheville, NC, told us that sales contracts               had been steady, and that lower mortgage rates had "kept them alive."               Respondents from several areas stated that sales of expensive homes               had virtually halted. They said buyers appeared to have downsized               their expectations, and that lower and mid priced homes continued               to sell well. Most builders reported little change in subcontractor               costs or wage rates.
Commercial Realtors across the District reported               that leasing activity was almost "non-existent" during the week               after the attacks. Since then, leasing activity has gradually regained               momentum, but remains below early September levels. The District's               industrial sector remained sluggish and industrial leasing activity               continued to soften--a Northern Virginia Realtor noted that many               firms utilizing industrial space were "belt-tightening" and trying               to "right-size." The office and retail sectors, meanwhile, have               shown resilience in recent weeks. A contact in Columbia, SC, reported               that despite a "depressed" attitude within the business community,               business firms continued to move forward with their office leasing               plans. The demand for Class A office space was generally flat across               the District. In Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia, however,               office space was being acquired for displaced Pentagon employees               and for other federal government workers.
Tourism in the District declined sharply in the wake of the terrorist               attacks of September 11, but by early October signs of a rebound               had emerged in most areas. Contacts throughout the District reported               widespread cancellations of conventions in September, in part because               of airport shutdowns and flight cancellations. A contact at a hotel               in Myrtle Beach, SC, told us that his business had lost about $40-45               million since the attacks, primarily because of the cancellation               of 30 large conventions. He noted, however, that two-thirds of the               parties that canceled subsequently rebooked and that business was               almost "back to normal." Respondents in Washington, DC, said that               area's tourism and hospitality businesses lost about $10 million               a day in revenues in September and that they expected below par               revenues in coming months.
Dry weather and cooler-than-normal temperatures provided ideal conditions               for crop harvesting in recent weeks. Corn harvesting was ahead of               schedule in Maryland, North Carolina, and West Virginia, and was               drawing to a close in South Carolina and Virginia, where better-than-expected               yields were reported. The soybean harvest was ahead of schedule               in Maryland but behind schedule in West Virginia. District agricultural               analysts reported that continued dry conditions were stressing pastures               in Virginia, resulting in an earlier-than-normal feeding of hay               to livestock in some counties.
