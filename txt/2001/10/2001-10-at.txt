Economic activity in the Sixth District was significantly affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11.  The immediate impact was quite negative, including disrupted sales, air travel and production.  Spending appeared to be recovering by late September, but a sluggish pace of activity is expected to dominate the region's economy over the next few months.  Merchants reported heavy discounting and anticipated weak holiday sales based on the current low level of "early bird" seasonal shopping.  Incentives, such as zero percent financing, bolstered weak vehicle sales, but sales remained well below year-ago levels overall.  The single-family housing market continued to moderate through early October.  Sales have been supported by a modest reduction of mortgage interest rates, and bankers reported strong refinancing activity.  However, commercial real estate markets remained weak.  More projects have been put on hold or have been cancelled, and vacancy rates continued to rise.  Activity in the tourism and hospitality sector fell across the District after September 11.  Traffic has remained low through early October, particularly where airline travel was involved.  The factory sector continued to be very weak and some contacts noted falling productivity because of the diversion of resources toward increased security.  As before, few signs of increasing inflation were indicated; however, there were reports of much higher liability insurance premiums since the attacks.
Contacts reported that the zero percent financing rates and other sales incentives put in place in September have helped prevent a larger collapse in new vehicle sales.  Overall, regional vehicle sales were down from last year, despite a late month rally in response to special deals.  Some dealers noted that truck sales have been weaker than car sales.  Used car dealers noted an excess supply of used vehicles as rental companies were rapidly de-fleeting in response of slower business and pleasure travel.
Commercial real estate markets continued to be characterized by large amounts of sublease space and rising vacancy rates.  As a result of recent events, additional projects have been postponed or cancelled.  Industry contacts indicated that a significant pick up in regional commercial construction is not expected until next year.
Consumer price inflation pressures remained subdued.  Indeed, many retailers have heavily discounted the prices of consumer items in an effort to stimulate activity.  Prices of hotel rooms and airline tickets have also been cut.  Gulf Coast oil and natural gas prices have fallen in response to reduced demand.  Significant increases were noted in liability insurance rates since the September 11 attacks.
