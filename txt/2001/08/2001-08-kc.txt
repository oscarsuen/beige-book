The Tenth District economy weakened further in July.  Manufacturing activity declined, construction and real estate activity slowed, and retail sales were flat.  On a positive note, vehicle sales picked up following several months of decline, and the energy sector continued to perform well.  In the farm economy, wheat yields in many areas were better than previously expected.  District labor markets remained similar to the previous survey, with employers having a much easier time hiring most kinds of workers than earlier in the year.  Wage pressures were minimal, and most prices remained steady.
