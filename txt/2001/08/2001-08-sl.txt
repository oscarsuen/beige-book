Growth in the District economy remains slow, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which is experiencing almost no growth.  Retail sales are flat when compared with a year earlier, although sales have picked up recently.  Manufacturers report a further slowing of activity, with accounts of layoffs and downsizing now outnumbering those of employment increases.  Residential real estate markets have remained strong, with sales and prices on the rise.  Commercial real estate markets have been mixed.  Loans on the books of District banks are down somewhat, although deposits have been rising.  Loan delinquencies are up slightly, but remain at manageable levels.  Crops are generally in good-to-excellent condition around the District.  Recent rains have helped restore topsoil moisture levels.
Residential construction is steady in most of the District.  With the market for skilled construction workers still tight in parts of the District, some contacts have recently noted a decline in the number of sub-contractor bids per project.  In most District metropolitan areas, June monthly building permit levels are down from their relatively strong May numbers.  On a year-to-date basis, more than half of the District's metro areas have June permit levels that are up from a year earlier.
Several bankers report that loan delinquencies have been increasing, but remain at manageable levels.  Bankers also have recently tightened credit standards somewhat, particularly for business loans.  Many banks are looking into new programs and technologies to increase non-interest income and reduce non-interest expenses.
The corn, cotton, soybean, and rice crops are generally in good-to-excellent condition in most of the District.  In Missouri, however, the soybean and cotton crops are in only fair condition.  Contacts in Kentucky and Tennessee report that the tobacco crop is in mostly good-to-excellent condition, despite minor disease problems.
Although most District states experienced hot and dry weather in early July, widely scattered showers later that month helped restore topsoil moisture to adequate levels, which enhanced development of the corn, cotton, soybean, and rice crops.  That said, small pockets of dry soil persist in some areas of the southern part of the District.
