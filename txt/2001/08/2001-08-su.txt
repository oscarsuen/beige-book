Reports from most Federal Reserve Districts point to slow             growth or lateral movement in economic activity in June and July.             Retail sales generally were sluggish and frequently below expectations,             despite substantial discounting on a wide range of consumer goods.             Manufacturing activity in nearly all sectors and regions declined             further in recent months as producers adjusted to weak domestic and             foreign demand and worked through accumulated inventories. Sustained             weakness in the manufacturing sector spilled over to other businesses,             with many Districts indicating declines in demand for office space             and trucking and shipping services. In contrast, residential real             estate markets remained stable and even expanded in some areas, with             the relative strength of the sector attributed in part to lower mortgage             interest rates. Agricultural producers continued to struggle against             low prices, weak exports, higher energy costs, and the weather, although             some regions reported improvement in growing conditions since the             last survey period. Financial institutions across the country reported             reduced demand for a wide variety of loans, tighter credit standards,             and stable-to-deteriorating quality of existing loans and leases;             residential mortgages were the notable exception to these trends.
Continued slow economic growth loosened labor markets             and eased wage pressures in most Districts in June and July, but rising             benefit costs continued to add to compensation costs. Prices for energy,             fuel, and many material inputs fell in most regions. Falling input             costs and stiff domestic and foreign competition kept prices of most             consumer goods in check.
Districts reporting on inventories at retail outlets             indicated that most businesses were able to keep stocks in balance.             Still, there were scattered reports of retailers canceling orders             or asking manufacturers to warehouse deliveries until existing inventories             are cleared. Contacts noted that orders for back-to-school and Christmas             merchandise were running lower than last year in anticipation of slower             sales.
Layoffs and slower economic growth reportedly damped tourism             in many parts of the country. Many Districts noted that airline bookings,             hotel occupancies, and hotel room rates fell in recent months. However,             hotels principally struggled with a decline in business travel as             companies worked to cut costs in light of slower earnings growth.
Manufacturing            Manufacturing activity declined further in recent weeks, as producers             responded to ongoing weakness in demand and worked to balance inventories.             Reports of reduced work hours, lost overtime, forced furloughs, planned             shutdowns, and layoffs were pervasive. Nearly every District reported             that new orders and shipments for durable and non-durable manufactured             products remained sluggish during the recent survey period, with declines             recorded for producers in some sectors. Weakness was especially evident             among producers of apparel and textiles, computers, semiconductors,             steel, and telecommunications gear. In addition to conditions in the             domestic economy, Districts attributed the current malaise in manufacturing             to softening international demand for U.S. goodsâ€”particularly in             Europe and Asia. On the up side, Districts reported that producers             were making progress in running down their excess inventories.
Districts indicated that residential real estate markets generally             remained stable in recent months, though signs of weakness were apparent             in some regions. Atlanta, Cleveland, Minneapolis, New York, Richmond,             and St. Louis reported continued brisk demand for low and moderately             priced homes; one District reported that homes "priced right" continued             to sell quickly, often attracting multiple bidders. In Boston, Chicago,             and San Francisco, demand remained stable but weakness in the high-end             market was noted. Dallas and Kansas City reported flat to slower growth             in home sales, with some concerns about rising inventories. In general,             Districts attributed the continued strength of residential real estate             in part to lower mortgage interest rates.
Overall, Districts characterized financial markets as cautious,             with both borrowers and lenders pulling back in response to economic             uncertainty. There were some reports of deteriorating credit quality,             particularly for credits to manufacturing and agricultural businesses.             A number of Districts reported that lenders had tightened standards             in recent weeks, particularly for business loans.
Looser labor markets in most Districts helped to contain wage             pressures in recent months. However, benefit costs rose, particularly             for health and other forms of insurance coverage. Rising insurance             premiums and the slowing economy reportedly prompted some employers             to reevaluate benefit packages. Kansas City reported that firms were             working on ways to reduce employee benefits such as free parking and             health club memberships.
Fuel and energy prices fell in June and July in most             Districts, lessening the burden on businesses and easing pressure             on consumer budgets. Lower gasoline prices allowed shippers and truckers             to reduce or remove fuel surcharges imposed earlier this year. Lower             energy costs also contributed to price declines for a number of manufactured             goods. However, upward price pressure was reported for pharmaceuticals,             various services, and single-family housing in some regions. In addition,             retail electricity rates were up sharply in California in June, as             previously authorized rate hikes took effect. In general, however,             declining input costs and stiff domestic and foreign competition continued             to restrain consumer prices.
