Twelfth District contacts reported continued slowing in economic growth and reduced pressures on non-energy related prices and wages in most sectors in the June to late-July period.  The cost of energy at the retail level increased on balance, as higher electricity rates were only partially offset by lower rates on natural gas.  Respondents indicated that conservation was the most common action taken to offset higher electricity prices; though there were isolated reports of curtailments in production.  District retailers experienced weak sales and many offered price discounts.  Manufacturers reported further deterioration in sales and continued contraction in employment.  With few exceptions, respondents indicated that investment in high-tech equipment and software remained depressed.  Respondents also noted that conditions softened in commercial real estate markets, while single-family housing markets remained more stable.  District agricultural producers continued to struggle against low prices, weak exports, higher energy costs, and the weather.  District financial institutions reported further tightening of lending standards and weaker demand for credit.
Twelfth District businesses continued to adjust to the high cost of electricity during the June to late-July period.  Respondents frequently cited aggressive conservation efforts to reduce usage and costs.  Some respondents also have added backup power systems and a few have changed production schedules.  Some power suppliers have been buying power back from farmers and large industrial users, which in turn have reduced their operations.  Some hotels and construction firms reported passing along higher energy costs to consumers, while other contacts, especially those in agriculture, reported that they were absorbing the higher costs.
Service sector jobs in the District remain at close to December 2000 levels.  Contacts reported cutbacks in jobs in the high-tech services and advertising sectors.  Respondents from Hawaii noted that the travel and tourism services sectors have slowed, and the most recent published data show May hotel occupancy rates were below year-earlier rates.
With few exceptions, District contacts reported that the level of investment spending on computers, information-processing technology, and software remained below spending on such items a year earlier.  Respondents attributed the reduction to high levels of high-tech investment in 2000 and a general cutback in investment in response to uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and efforts to reduce costs.  While contacts indicated that the pace of investment spending had not deteriorated in the June through late-July period compared to the previous survey period, neither did they report signs of an upturn.
In the residential sector, respondents indicated that single-family housing markets remain stable in most of the District.  Single-family markets reportedly were boosted in part by relatively low mortgage rates.  There are signs, however, of a slowdown in home sales in the high-end market in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Declines in rental rates in some markets also could affect multi-family construction activity.
