Contacts throughout the Sixth District suggest that economic activity was sluggish in June and July.  Retail sales results were weak and volume remained supported by heavy discounting.  The District's single-family housing market continued to perform well, whereas there was significantly less commercial construction than a year earlier.  Manufacturing output continued to fall, resulting in further job losses.  Loan activity was mixed; residential lending was strong, while commercial lending was slow.  Business travel softened throughout the District, while leisure travel remained strong in south Florida.
Auto sales remained generally soft in June, although an increase in sales activity in early July was noted.  Industry contacts indicated that regional sales for some manufacturers were weaker, and inventory levels higher, than in the nation as a whole.  However, sales of luxury cars and some SUV models did improve in response to generous incentives offered by vehicle manufacturers.  Sales of lower priced and fuel-efficient models have also improved.
At the same time, the commercial real estate market continued to weaken.  Sublease space has increased in both office and industrial markets across the District, resulting in higher vacancy rates and increased use of rental incentives.  Office, industrial, and retail construction has slowed significantly and is expected to remain subdued through year-end.  Few new commercial construction projects have been announced.
Contacts cited few instances of price escalation in June and July.  Reports indicated significant energy price reductions and continued price discounting at retail stores.  However, lumber prices in July remained higher than a year earlier, and drywall prices increased sharply during July.  House prices and healthcare costs have also continued to increase.
