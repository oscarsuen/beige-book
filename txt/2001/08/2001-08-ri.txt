The Fifth District economy advanced at a slow pace in June and July, with moderate growth at services firms accounting for most of the increase.  Demand for services grew at a steady pace, although firms said they were watching expenses closely.  Retailers reported sharp drops in sales in recent weeks and they reduced employment in July.  Manufacturing shipments and new orders continued to skid.  Most manufacturers, however, remained optimistic that shipments would pick up by the end of the year.  Residential Realtors reported little change in home sales, while commercial Realtors said that leasing and construction activity continued to weaken.  Prices of manufactured products were flat, and prices of services were modestly higher.  In agriculture, hot and dry weather stressed crops and pastures in many areas of the District, although rain swept across much of the region in late July.
Commercial Realtors across the District reported that leasing and construction activity generally continued to weaken in recent weeks.  Office and industrial leasing was softer, reflecting sagging business conditions in the high-tech and manufacturing sectors.  Contacts in Northern Virginia and Raleigh, N.C., generally reported a "tenant's market" in office space due to the high-tech shakeout in those areas.  Although contract rental rates were relatively stable across commercial sectors, effective rental rates eased in the office and industrial sectors and landlords offered various concessions, such as a month's free rent, to entice tenants.  New construction remained sluggish, but contacts in Charlotte, N.C., and Richmond, Va. were "guardedly optimistic" that construction activity would soon pick up.  In addition, a contact in Baltimore said that commercial contractors' "order books" were full for the next twelve to fifteen months.
