Third District businesses on the whole reported little or             no improvement in July compared with June. In some sectors activity             was below year-ago levels. Manufacturers reported declines in shipments             and orders during the month. Retail sales were mixed. General merchandise             sales were flat compared with June and down from July of last year,             but sales of automobiles increased from June to July. Bank loan volumes             edged down during the month, but mortgage refinancing remained strong.             Tourism activity throughout the District has been slower this summer             than last, and business travel has declined sharply from a year ago.
Businesses in the District generally expect some slight             improvement in the fall. Manufacturers forecast an increase in orders             within the next six months, although they are planning only small             increases in employment and working hours. Retailers look for a pickup             in sales in the fall, but most do not anticipate significant gains.             Bankers expect lending in all major credit categories to be virtually             flat for at least several more months.
Manufacturers expect business conditions to improve             during the next six months. Firms in nearly all of the major manufacturing             sectors in the region expect demand for their products to increase,             although makers of wood products, industrial machinery, and instruments             anticipate further declines in orders. Area manufacturers forecast             a rise in order backlogs in the next six months, but they plan only             slight increases in employment and working hours, on balance.
Store executives see few signs that sales might strengthen significantly.             Most of those contacted for this report anticipate a slow recovery             in sales during the fall selling season. Stocking of fall merchandise             has been restrained, and some retailers expressed concern that planned             inventories might not be adequate if consumer demand increases strongly.
Auto dealers generally indicated that sales picked             up a bit in July compared with June. Sales of imported automobiles             have been relatively stronger than sales of domestic automobiles.             Manufacturers' incentives continue to support a relatively high sales             rate in most parts of the region, but some dealers in areas where             unemployment has increased reported recent declines in sales.
Bankers in the Third District expect overall loan volumes             to be nearly flat for at least the next few months. Commercial bank             lending officers expressed heightened caution with respect to the             creditworthiness of potential business borrowers. Nevertheless, some             banks are actively seeking new opportunities to extend credit to well-capitalized             businesses in all industries, including commercial real estate.
