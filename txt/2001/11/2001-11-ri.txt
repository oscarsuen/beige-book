Fifth District economic activity edged lower             in October and the first few weeks of November as services and manufacturing             firms reported softer demand. Widespread declines in revenues at travel             related businesses such as airlines and car rental companies contributed             to moderate drops in overall service sector revenues and employment.             Manufacturing activity also fell as shipments, new orders, and employment             tumbled in October. Automobile sales jumped sharply, while non-automobile             sales stabilized, and retailers turned more optimistic about sales             prospects for the upcoming holiday season. Residential and commercial             real estate activity slowed, although lower mortgage rates buffered             the declines. Lending activity was mixedâ€”an increase in refinancings             contributed to a pickup in residential mortgage lending, but commercial             lending slipped as demand for business loans softened. In agriculture,             pastures were in poor condition in many areas as dry weather continued             to deplete soil moisture.
Commercial realtors across the District reported generally weaker leasing activity. A realtor in Bethesda, Md., described the commercial market as "slow, but steady." A Richmond, Va., realtor noted that leasing activity in the office sector could be attributed mainly to small firms "taking bites here and there" rather than large firms leasing substantial blocks of space. The availability of Class A office space increased slightly, except in Washington, D.C., where the federal government continued to seek office space for employees recently hired to bolster security and assist in the war effort. Rental rates fell slightly across all sectors, with landlords' rent and facility upgrade concessions increasingly becoming the norm. New construction of build-to-suit projects, targeted mainly for small- to mid-sized professional groups such as law practices, increased across the District.
