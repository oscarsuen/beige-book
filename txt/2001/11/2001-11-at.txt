District contacts indicated that economic conditions             in the Southeast continued to be weak despite record auto sales in             October and the continued resilience of housing markets. Retailers             reported that sales growth through mid-November had moderated after             a strong rebound in October. The single-family housing market remained             solid overall, whereas commercial real estate markets weakened further.             Manufacturing production declined and plant closings and layoff announcements             continued. Tourist activity rebounded from post-attack lows but fell             short of year-ago levels. Few signs of inflation were apparent apart             from increased healthcare and insurance costs.
Auto sales increased to record levels in the District in response to the zero percent financing and extended warranty incentives offered by several manufacturers.  Industry contacts reported dramatic gains in October sales compared with a year ago, far exceeding their sales objectives and sharply reducing inventory levels.  The pace of sales slowed in early November as the financing incentives narrowed in scope.  Record numbers of trade-ins and rental car fleet reductions have caused used car inventories to swell across the District leading to sharp declines in used car prices.
