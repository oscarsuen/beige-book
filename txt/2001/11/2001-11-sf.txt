Economic activity remained weak during the survey             period of October and early November, although signs of further deterioration             in economic conditions compared with September were limited. Prices             fell for some items, largely due to discounting by retailers and service             providers, with little or no upward movement overall. Wage increases             were limited. Retail sales and travel spending picked up noticeably             compared with September but, with the exception of strong auto sales,             remained weak. Manufacturing output and employment declined further.             Agricultural products were in ample supply, and some producers struggled             with low sales prices. Demand for commercial real estate declined             in most areas, and residential real estate markets cooled, although             home prices generally remained firm. Loan demand fell on net, due             to weaker demand from businesses.
Service providers outside the travel industry also faced weak conditions.  Business was slow for advertising, marketing, public relations, management consulting, and computer services firms throughout the District, and these firms implemented significant job cuts.  Providers of telecommunications services, including high-speed Internet services, also faced weak demand.
