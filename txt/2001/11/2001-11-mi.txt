Economic activity in the Ninth District decreased in late October and early November. Commercial real estate, agriculture, energy and mining are down. Manufacturing, tourism and consumer spending are down slightly, although auto sales are strong. Labor markets weakened as a result of additional layoff announcements. Overall wages and prices are stable, with the exception of increases in health care and property insurance rates and decreases in cattle hide prices.
Homebuilding is slightly higher than a year ago in several parts of the district. The value of permits in October was higher than a year ago in Billings and Sioux Falls, while the number of permits was slightly higher in Minneapolis-St. Paul. However, October sales of existing homes in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area were down 3 percent compared with last year.
Auto dealers reported that new car sales reached high levels. October new car sales in the Dakotas increased from September due to manufacturer incentives, according to auto dealer association representatives. One representative described October as a "barn-burner," but is concerned about future sales. A Minnesota dealership noted that buying activity in November is at a more traditional rate following October's frenzied pace.
Tourism activity is down for fly destinations and generally level for drive destinations. A bank director reported that recent air traffic at a central Montana airport is at a 20-year low. Hotel occupancy in St. Paul was off about 10 percent in October compared with a year ago, according to a convention and visitors bureau representative. Fall tourism was down slightly in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, but inquiries for winter tourism activity are solid, according to an official. Tourism activity in the Black Hills area of South Dakota was up about 5 percent in October compared with last year.
In contrast, a health insurance company plans to expand operations in northern Minnesota, adding about 200 jobs. A home mortgage company will add 100 jobs in Minneapolis due in part to increased refinancing activity.
Increases in wages and salaries are moderate. Only 10 percent of respondents to a survey of manufacturers in Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Dakotas reported higher wages in October, down from 35 percent a year ago. According to preliminary results of the Minneapolis Fed's business conditions survey, almost 95 percent of respondents (up from 67 percent a year ago) expect wages to increase no more than 3 percent in 2002.
Price changes are modest, except for notable decreases in cattle hides           and increases in health care and property insurance rates. Prices for           cattle hides and skins dropped almost 8 percent in October compared           with a month earlier. Health care costs for employers in the Minneapolis-St.           Paul area are expected to finish the year up 7.1 percent compared with           the previous year, according to a consulting firm. Several bank directors           reported recent significant increases in property insurance rates. According           to the October survey of manufacturers in Minnesota, Wisconsin and the           Dakotas, 19 percent of respondents reported recent increases in product           prices, down from 28 percent a year ago.
