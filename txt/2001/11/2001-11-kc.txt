The Tenth District economy remained generally sluggish in late October and early November, though not all signs were negative.  Manufacturing activity continued to languish, commercial real estate activity weakened, and energy activity slowed further.  However, auto sales surged in most of the district due to consumer incentives, and retail sales and housing activity rebounded somewhat from the dropoff following the terrorist attacks.  In the farm economy, a dry autumn limited forage supplies and raised concerns about soil moisture going into winter.  District labor markets continued to ease, as further job cuts took effect.  Wage pressures also remained subdued.  Price discounting at many stores held retail prices in check, and prices for finished factory goods edged lower due to weak demand.  Prices for most construction and manufacturing materials were stable.
