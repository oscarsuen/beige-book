Economic activity in the Seventh District remained             soft through October and mid-November. Consumer spending was modest             ahead of the holiday shopping season, and some retailers were already             discounting merchandise to attract shoppers. Construction activity             slowed in recent months, with weakening reported in both residential             and nonresidential segments. Conditions in manufacturing industries             continued to soften, despite relatively strong light vehicle sales.             Home refinancing activity remained very strong, but demand for business             loans was said to be waning. Joblessness continued to rise with the             slowing economy, and near-term hiring plans were lowered. The fall             harvest lagged behind the pace of recent years, but as of mid-November             was nearing completion under ideal weather conditions.
