Most districts report that economic activity was little changed or decelerating in April and May. Retail sales and tourism have been slow to flat across the nation. Most districts report that manufacturing activity has declined or remained weak. Commercial real estate markets have softened. New construction, while still at high levels in a number of districts, appears to have leveled off. The agricultural sector has been hurt by adverse growing conditions and higher input costs. Mining activity is stagnant. The one bright spot is the continued growth in energy exploration. Labor markets continue to ease in all districts, although a shortage of workers is reported for some occupations. Wage and price increases are moderate, but significant increases are noted in energy and health care. Lending activity varies based on location and type of loan, although credit quality has slipped in many districts.
Auto sales in Philadelphia are lower than last year. Auto sales fell in Kansas City, particularly for trucks and SUVs, but dealers are cautiously optimistic about summer prospects. Minneapolis reports auto sales on par with a year ago in North Dakota, but new car and truck registrations are down from last year in South Dakota. Sales for more fuel-efficient vehicles are "picking up" in Chicago. In Dallas, auto sales are increasing slowly, but year-to-date figures are still below those of 2000. Houston auto dealers report very strong auto sales in April.
Tourism is lackluster. New York reports that Manhattan's hotel occupancy rates in March and April were 10 percentage points lower than a year ago, and average room rates saw the biggest decline in eight years. Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas report slow commercial air travel. High fuel prices and consumer uncertainty appear to be restraining travel to Hawaii, Las Vegas and other high-end destinations in the San Francisco district. In contrast, Richmond reports strong Memorial Day bookings and spending.
Residential construction is mixed, while home buying is generally active. Homebuilding is strong in the St. Louis district and expanding modestly in Kansas City; however, homebuilding is soft in the Chicago and Minneapolis districts. Residential real estate markets are fairly buoyant in the New York district, while recent sales increases are reported in Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta and Minneapolis. In the Kansas City district home sales are flat, while sales have slowed in the Philadelphia, Chicago and Dallas districts. The inventory of homes on the market is low in Philadelphia, but is higher in at least parts of the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts.
Non-energy prices are generally reported stable. Dallas says that stiff competition, excess capacity and high inventories are keeping prices in check in telecommunications and other industries. High inventories are reportedly keeping prices down in the retail sector and in some cases pushing them lower. Retailers -- particularly of high-end goods -- in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta and San Francisco report deeply discounted prices to move overstocked inventories and boost sales. Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco report that manufacturer rebates and other incentives have helped lower car and truck prices. Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta and Dallas all report higher lumber prices.
Districts report higher energy prices across the board, with mixed consequences. Shipping costs are up in Cleveland; Dallas reports that rail transport surcharges are increasing; San Francisco says that surcharges are increasing but "price pass-throughs remained partial."
