Overall business conditions in the Third District continued to be           soft in May. Manufacturers reported further declines in orders and working           hours. General merchandise sales were flat compared with April and with           May of last year. Auto sales in May were below the same month last year.           Bank loan volumes rose moderately during the month. Residential real           estate sales slipped, and commercial leasing activity continued to decline.
Businesses contacted for this report generally expect growth to resume           sometime during the second half of the year, albeit at a slow pace.           Manufacturers expect an increase in orders within the next six months,           but they do not plan to extend working hours. Retailers anticipate a           slow summer followed by a slight pickup in sales in the fall. Bankers           anticipate slight gains in business and consumer lending, but they expect           the demand for real estate loans to ease.
Manufacturers indicated that, except for fuels and electricity, prices           were steady in May. Firms contacted during the month indicated that           slow demand and foreign competition were keeping most input and output           prices in check. But rising fuel prices were cited by many firms as           a deterrent to expanded sales, especially of motor vehicles and construction           equipment.
Manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the next           six months. Firms in nearly all of the major manufacturing sectors in           the region forecast higher demand for their products in the second half           of the year. The exceptions are apparel producers, who anticipate a           drop in orders, and producers of chemicals, transportation equipment,           and industrial materials, who expect steady order rates. Despite the           forecasted increase in business, area manufacturers project no rise           in order backlogs, and they do not plan to extend working hours during           the next six months.
Store executives generally anticipate a slow summer. Most of those           contacted for this report expect a slight pickup in the fall, and they           have planned their purchasing accordingly. However, several store executives           said they are prepared to cut or cancel orders if sales do not turn           up.
Auto dealers indicated that sales ran at a nearly steady pace during           May but below the rate posted in May of last year. Manufacturers' incentives           remain extensive, and dealers said that rebates and low-cost financing           were necessary to keep sales from slipping further.
Bankers in the Third District expect overall loan volumes to increase           slightly during the second half of the year. They anticipate slow growth           in business lending and modest gains in consumer loans, but a decline           in residential mortgage activity. Some bankers expressed concern that           credit quality could slip during the rest of the year if overall economic           conditions do not improve, but they do not anticipate a significant           deterioration in either business or consumer loan portfolios.
Residential real estate agents generally indicated that sales of existing           homes have slowed recently. Homebuilders reported that sales declined           during May. For both existing and new homes, the slowdown has been sharper           in the higher price ranges. House prices have been close to steady for           both new and existing homes. Real estate agents and builders indicated           that the inventory of homes for sale has been running close to or a           little below demand. Due to the relatively tight inventory, homes have           been selling quickly and at asking prices.
