The District economy, particularly the manufacturing sector, continues to show signs of sluggish growth.  Growth at manufacturers continues to slow, and profit margins continue to narrow.  Service providers are also feeling a pinch, but to a lesser degree.  High fuel prices have forced some trucking companies to either cut back their fleets or shutdown.  Housing markets are experiencing a seasonal boost, with sales and prices increasing around the District.  Construction activity has also picked up.  Banks have recently tightened credit standards on many of their loan products; at the same time, demand for some of these loans has weakened moderately.  The spring planting is essentially complete.  Crops are in good-to-excellent condition overall, although there has been some army worm damage reported.
The service sector has also been affected by the recent economic slowdown, but to a lesser extent than manufacturing.  One area of concern, for example, is distribution and logistic services.  A Memphis contact notes that there has been a slowing in the number of packages and amount of freight being shipped.  Consequently, one of the District's (and nation's) largest package handling companies, FedEx, has announced a hiring freeze and a suspension of employee profit sharing.  The trucking industry continues to experience profit losses because of the high price of fuel.  These losses have forced many small trucking companies to file for Chapter 11 protection, while larger firms cope by parking portions of their fleets and laying off workers.  Contacts have noted that recent earnings reports seem to foretell a possible ongoing decline in profits for the rest of 2001.
Residential construction is strong in most parts of the District.  April monthly building permits in more than half of the District's metropolitan areas were up, in some cases by 15 percent or more.  Year-to-date building permits through April in all but five District metro areas remained below their relatively strong levels of a year earlier.  Contacts report that commercial construction is steady in the District.  New or expanding jails, libraries, schools and universities are just a few of the projects that are underway in Indiana and Kentucky, for example.
At the same time credit standards have been tightened, demand for C&I and consumer loans has become moderately weaker, according to about half of the survey's respondents.  Demand for commercial real estate loans and mortgages has remained essentially unchanged.
Contacts report army worm damage across the District -- particularly southern Illinois, Indiana and Missouri -- in hayfields, tall grass fields, pastures and some corn, soybean and winter wheat fields.  The full extent of the damage to the wheat crop will not be known until the harvest is complete.  The pace of the wheat harvest in Mississippi is modestly slower this year than last, with one contact suggesting that yields might be below average because of a wetter-than-normal winter.
