Reports from Twelfth District contacts point to a deceleration in economic growth in May, with slowing evident in most sectors.  Respondents reported less cost pressure on non-energy inputs, but noted that rising energy prices continued to damp profitability.  Higher unemployment rates eased wage and salary growth in many areas of the District, but rising benefit costs remained a concern.  Retailers and service providers in the District noted slower sales growth, particularly for big-ticket items such as cars and electronics and luxury services such as high-speed Internet access and wireless web phones.  Higher energy prices and softening demand for high-tech goods continued to depress the District's manufacturing sector, with many firms reducing output and cutting jobs.  Agricultural producers remained strapped by low commodity prices and higher input costs.  Respondents noted increased weakness in residential and commercial real estate markets throughout the District in recent weeks, owing largely to the downturn in the technology sector and uncertainty about the economy.  Credit conditions weakened slightly in May, as loan demand fell, delinquencies rose, and lenders tightened credit standards.
Energy costs for businesses and consumers increased further in May, and additional rate hikes are expected in June.  Respondents noted that higher energy costs increasingly are being passed on to consumers, typically in the form of energy surcharges.  However, the price pass-throughs remained partial and higher energy costs continued to cut into profits.  A dominant theme among respondents was their use of conservation measures to reduce energy costs.  The most common conservation measures included lowering lighting and air conditioning during work hours and shutting off lights, computers, and monitors during off hours.  Respondents noted that some businesses -- for example, restaurants, laundries, lumber and wood product makers, and food processors -- have cut back hours of operation to reduce energy costs.
Looser labor markets eased wage and salary pressures in many District states, although wage demands by entry-level workers remained high.  In contrast, wages for mid-level employees and all but the best high-skilled workers stabilized, with many contacts reporting average wage increases of between zero and one percent this year.  Rising benefit costs remained a concern for many District employers.
Commercial real estate markets also saw increased vacancy rates and falling lease rates.  The collapse of the dot-com sector as well as ongoing downsizing among high-tech manufacturers and software companies has put a large amount of sublease space on the market, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle.  General slowing in the economy has increased vacancies in Portland and Salt Lake City.  Construction is responding to the change in market conditions.  Respondents noted that a number of large long-term projects have been put on hold until the market stabilizes.
