Eleventh District economic activity continued to decelerate in April and May. Manufacturing activity showed signs of stabilizing after deteriorating for most of 2001. Most retailers said the level of sales was flat or up slightly over the past six weeks. However, growth in the demand for business services continued to decelerate while construction and real estate markets continued to cool. Lending activity continued to slow while non-performing loans and delinquencies increased. Energy activity continues to accelerate. Agricultural conditions have been generally favorable.
In general, contacts in most industries are expecting activity to remain sluggish throughout the year. A few contacts believe activity may pick up some in the second half, others are focused on the fourth quarter and some are looking for a pick up in 2002. Several contacts mentioned a high degree of uncertainty, with the pace of economic activity being driven by consumer confidence (or lack thereof).
High fuel costs remain a concern for many firms. Crude oil prices held steady in May, despite a buildup in inventories, which are about 8 percent higher than a year ago. U.S. average retail gasoline prices have risen to over $1.70 in recent weeks. Gasoline inventories remain near the very low levels of last year, and inventories of reformulated gasoline are 9 percent lower than a year ago. With 36 types of fuel to stock in different regions, spot shortages in some regions of the country are expected. High natural gas prices are pressuring feedstock costs for products such as styrene, polyester, and benzene. Fuel surcharges have increased in the railroad industry. Natural gas prices have drifted downward steadily, as mild spring weather allowed for record levels of injections into storage fields, but inventories are 11 percent under the six-year average for this time of year.
Prices are rising for energy-related products and services, such as onshore and offshore rigs, supply boats, fabricated metals used in the energy industry, and all types of energy equipment. Selling prices have also been rising for lumber, and inventories are gradually dropping down to desired levels. Paper prices, which had been falling, now appear to be stabilizing.
Several manufacturers reported that sales remained unchanged or continued to deteriorate. Glass producers supplying the automotive industry report no change in demand. Demand for food products also remained unchanged over the past few weeks, but demand for apparel products was below that of a year ago. Demand for primary metals continued to soften over the past few weeks, and factories are not running at capacity. Contacts attribute slow sales to weakness in automotive, trucking, agriculture and commercial construction. Fabricated metals producers also report slower activity, except for products related to the energy industry.
Demand for telecommunications products appears to be stabilizing at extremely low levels, with the rate of decline slowing. Sales are about 25 percent below a year ago, and telecommunications firms continue to "ramp down" production. Sales of other high-tech products weakened over the past few weeks, across both consumer and business products. Most of the weakness continues to come from the U.S. market, but several respondents reported weakening sales in Europe. Excess capacity has increased and was reported to be very significant in semiconductors and telecommunications. Some respondents said that inventories were well managed, but others reported a buildup of parts and finished goods. There appears to be a general consensus among contacts that the industry is at or very close to the bottom with a turnaround likely to begin in the fourth quarter.
Petrochemical capacity continued to come back on line as natural gas prices drifted downward. Demand for petrochemicals is weak, however. U.S. feedstock prices make production noncompetitive in world markets because domestic producers use natural gas as a feedstock while most international producers use oil. High gasoline prices are generating excellent profits for refiners. Refineries are operating at very high levels of capacity utilization to take advantage of the very strong margins.
Transportation firms report continued sluggish demand. Airlines say demand from both leisure and business travelers has softened. Railroad activity has slowed due to flooding in the upper Midwest and fewer auto shipments, but shipments of coal and petroleum are up, and shipping of international containers is up slightly. Higher fuel prices have led truckers to lose short haul business to railroads because railroads use fuel four times more efficiently.
