Reports from around the District suggested that the overall pace of economic activity remained sluggish in May.  The manufacturing sector continued to contract, and this has contributed to further loosening in District labor markets and an easing in wage pressures.  Retailers reported modest sales growth and the continued use of aggressive pricing strategies.  New automobile sales have been soft, particularly in the light truck segment.  Buoyed by strength in Florida markets, the District's single-family residential market remained robust.  In contrast, commercial real estate markets were mostly weaker.  Demand for consumer loans eased slightly, but mortgage activity continued to be strong.  Reports on the tourism and hospitality industry were cautiously optimistic.
Automobile sales during April and May have generally disappointed District dealers, but with some variation across product lines.  Price discounting and sales promotions remained in force.  Reports indicated that inventories of some light trucks were higher than normal.
At the same time, commercial real estate markets continued to experience weaker demand.  In some locations a surplus of sublease space has emerged, and some new buildings have been completed without tenants in place.  This has resulted in increased vacancy rates and notable price reductions.  Developers and lenders have reportedly become increasingly cautious about new office and industrial development, and several new retail projects have been delayed or put on hold.  Similarly, District multifamily development has slowed significantly as vacancy rates have increased in several locations.
No significant general price escalation was reported.  However, the price of lumber increased in May as suppliers to the construction industry worked to build up depleted inventories and as some foreign competition eased.  Natural gas prices remained elevated, and contacts again reported increased health care costs.
