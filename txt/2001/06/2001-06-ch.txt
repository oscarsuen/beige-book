Economic activity in the Seventh District slowed further in May, but contacts in some key factory segments were optimistic that the worst was over.  Following a modest pickup in April, consumer spending softened in May, partly as a result of unseasonably cool weather.  Construction and real estate activity was also modestly weaker, but remained generally strong.  The region's manufacturers continued to work off excess inventories, with most contacts confident that conditions had bottomed.  The District's labor markets slackened further in April and May, and recent college graduates were finding the job market far less accommodating than last year.  Farmland values continued to increase in the first quarter of the year.  Spring planting neared completion although wet soil conditions have hampered progress in portions of Iowa and Wisconsin.  In general, signs of any pickup in price inflation were absent from contact reports.
