The Ninth District economy is in the doldrums. Manufacturing, construction, mining and agriculture activities are down from a year ago. Consumer spending and tourism are flat. However, strong prices are helping the energy sector. Labor markets are easing and wage increases are moderating. Price increases are generally modest, although significant increases are reported in energy, health insurance, apartment rental rates and cattle hides.
Homebuilding is down from a year ago, while home sales are up. Housing units authorized dropped 15 percent in the district for the three-month period ending in April compared with a year earlier. City officials in Eau Claire, Wis., expect a lower number of single-family homes built in 2001 compared with last year. However, the value of home sales closed in April in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area increased 20 percent over a year ago, while the number of listings on the market was up 15 percent.
Summer tourism activity in many parts of the district is expected to finish level with a year ago. Montana tourism is predicted to increase between 2 percent and 3 percent this summer compared with last year, according to officials. Advance reservations and inquiries are about the same as last year in the Black Hills area of South Dakota. Summer bookings at resorts in northwest Wisconsin are level with a year ago, according to a resort association representative.
An advisory council member from northwest Wisconsin reported that the area's labor shortage has eased from eight months ago. A representative from a temporary-staffing and placement firm that specializes in technical and computer positions in the Minneapolis area is receiving many more resumes from people who have been laid off.
In contrast, some industries continue to face tight labor markets, and a number of companies are hiring workers. In Minneapolis/St. Paul, 34 percent of companies surveyed by a major staffing company plan to hire more workers during the third quarter of 2001, while 9 percent expect to reduce staffing levels. This compares with 36 percent and 12 percent, respectively, a year ago.
Wage increases are modest, with manufacturing wages up 2.6 percent for the three-month period ending in April compared with a year earlier. A bank director reported that executive pay at a Minneapolis/St. Paul high-tech firm is down 10 percent from a year ago, while entry level jobs at most high-tech companies are seeing only 3 percent to 6 percent pay increases.
Overall price increases are modest, except for notable hikes in energy, health insurance, apartment rental rates and cattle hides. Higher gasoline prices are reported throughout the district, increasing costs for shipping and transportation. Health insurance costs are up 20 percent, according to bank directors. Average apartment rental rates in St. Paul are up about 15 percent in April from a year ago. Meanwhile, cattle hide costs for shoemaking are up 40 percent compared with last year.
