The Tenth District economy remained somewhat weak in May.  Retail sales were flat, manufacturing activity continued to slow, and commercial construction showed little change from previous surveys.  On the positive side, residential construction continued to edge higher and energy activity continued to expand.  In the farm economy, the district's winter wheat crop was in poor condition.  District labor markets appeared to ease further, especially for retail workers, and reports of wage pressures were rare.  Retail prices and prices for construction materials held steady, while prices for some manufacturing materials edged lower.
