Conversations with business contacts in the First District had a decidedly more pessimistic tone at the end of May than in previous months.  Retailers, manufacturers, temporary employment firms, and software makers report sales or revenues mostly flat or down from year-earlier levels.  Contacts in commercial real estate also report softer markets.
Employment levels are generally said to be holding steady, but some contacts report laying off employees.  Wage growth is moderating.  With one exception, retail contacts indicate that they are not raising prices; the weakest retail sectors are extensively discounting prices to move inventory.  The exception is lumber prices, which are reportedly rising.  Some sectors that are heavily discounting prices report eroding profit margins.  Otherwise, profit margins are said to be holding steady, with productivity improvements continuing to contain overall costs despite rising energy prices.
Most contacted retailers say they are continuing with previously planned expansions of their operations.  Looking forward, their mood has turned pessimistic.  Retail respondents no longer believe the economy will pick up during the second half of 2001; most expect flat to negative economic growth through the remainder of the year.  They are hopeful that a recovery will begin during 2002.
Respondents indicate that they are paying more for petroleum-based products, seafood, energy, and transportation, but most materials costs are flat to down.  Some companies have made modest upward adjustments in selected selling prices.  However, most say current market conditions make it impossible to raise prices.  Customers in the retail and automotive industries, in particular, are pushing for price reductions, resulting in abnormally low margins.
About two-thirds of manufacturing respondents have major cost-cutting programs underway.  Their plans include layoffs, temporary plant shutdowns, shorter work weeks, pay freezes, and sharp reductions in capital spending and inventories.  Most firms that are not aggressively cutting overall costs are nevertheless reducing their labor usage through attrition or automation.
In describing the economic environment they face in coming months, manufacturers often used words such as "tough" and "difficult."  The consensus is that conditions are unlikely to improve before late in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter.
All of the contacts say the market for all levels of tech workers has softened dramatically.  One reports being inundated with resumes from out-of-work computer engineers.  As a result, wage pressure and turnover are said to be down as well.  Most of the respondents are holding employment levels steady as they wait out this period of slowing demand.  One responding firm has cut its work force by about 5 percent.  In addition to freezing employment, about half the respondents are "clamping down on capital spending" until demand picks up.
The labor market has loosened in recent months and many contacts have more candidates than jobs available -- something unimaginable a year ago.  Most respondents report no increase or a slight decline in wages from a year ago.  Some say pressures from clients to lower prices are squeezing profit margins.  Most contacts are increasing their sales force in order to sell harder.
