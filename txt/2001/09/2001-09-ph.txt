Business activity in the region remained subdued in August. Manufacturers           reported declines in shipments and orders in August compared with July.           Retail sales rose slightly for the back-to-school shopping period, but           the underlying trend in consumer spending in the region showed no signs           of picking up. Motor vehicle sales slipped in August. Bank loan volumes           rose slightly in August, with gains in most major credit categories.           Commercial real estate markets eased somewhat. Residential real estate           markets were generally firm. Home sales have been steady, although off           from last year's pace, and price appreciation for existing homes continues           but appears to be moderating.
Looking ahead, businesses in the District have mixed views.  Manufacturers forecast increases in orders and shipments during the next six months.  Retailers, however, anticipate slower sales in the last quarter of this year.  Bank credit officers expect continued slow growth in lending.  Real estate contacts expect some further softening in commercial markets.  Residential real estate agents believe home sales will falter if the regional economy slows further.
Despite current weakness in the manufacturing sector, local companies expect conditions to improve during the next six months.  More than half of the firms polled in August forecast increases in orders and shipments.  They expect to extend working hours, although they do not plan to increase employment.  Area firms have been trimming inventories, and they plan to make further reductions in the next six months.  Capital spending plans at area firms remain limited, overall, although some firms within the chemicals, plastics, and instrumentation sectors have scheduled higher outlays for new plant and equipment during the next six months.
Local store executives said they were reviewing their sales plans for the balance of the year for possible downward revision.  Several merchants said they anticipate no increase in sales for the last quarter of this year compared with the same period last year.  Although most retailers indicated that their current inventory levels were not troublesome, many are considering reducing orders for merchandise to be delivered during the remaining months of the year.
Overall sales of cars and light trucks have slowed in recent weeks, although some import dealers have posted gains.  On balance, dealer inventories have increased, but most of the dealers surveyed said the increase was slight.  Manufacturers' incentives continue to support a relatively high sales rate, but dealers are becoming increasingly concerned that consumer confidence is weakening, portending a fall in demand.
Looking ahead, commercial bankers in the Third District generally expect continued slow growth in lending.  They anticipate some easing in the growth rate of real estate loans, but steady gains in personal and business loans.  Lending officers expect business activity and credit needs to increase slowly in most of the region's industries, except among computer manufacturing and information technology service companies.
Residential real estate agents generally indicated that sales of existing           homes have been running at a steady rate recently, albeit below the           rate set last year at this time. Price appreciation continues for existing           homes but appears to have moderated somewhat over the summer. Homebuilders           reported that sales were steady during July and August at around the           same rate as during the same months last year. Prices have been rising           significantly for new homes. Real estate agents and builders indicated           that relatively low mortgage interest rates and generally healthy financial           positions among consumers are supporting demand for homes, although           uncertainty about general economic conditions is keeping some prospective           buyers out of the market. Residential real estate contacts say sales           could slow sharply if the region's economy weakens further.
