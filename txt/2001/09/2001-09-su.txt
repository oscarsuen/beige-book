Extractive natural resource industries were reported to be operating at high levels in most cases.  The active oil and gas rig count in August was reported level to slightly lower than July in the Dallas, Kansas City, and Minneapolis Districts. Kansas City noted that drilling activity remained constrained by a shortage of rig workers.  Minneapolis observed that mining activity varied across the District.  Most iron mines were back in full production, following a slowdown earlier in the summer, while several nonferrous metal facilities in Montana remained closed.
