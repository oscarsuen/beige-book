The Tenth District economy showed fewer signs of slowing in August than earlier in the summer.  Retail sales were flat, the slump in manufacturing appeared to lessen, and residential construction activity edged up.  Moreover, energy activity remained strong.  An exception to the firming trend was commercial real estate, which deteriorated further.  In the farm economy, corn and soybean crops were in good condition in some parts of the district but were hurt by dry weather in other areas.  District labor markets were about the same as in the previous survey but less tight than earlier in the year, with most types of workers relatively easy to find.  Wage pressures remained generally subdued.  Retail prices were stable, but price pressures for manufactured goods increased somewhat.
