Sluggish growth characterized economic activity in the Sixth District in late summer, according to business contacts.  Merchants' sales improved modestly from earlier in the summer, but inventories were high.  Auto sales remained lackluster in spite of incentives.  Single-family construction and sales were near year-ago levels, but commercial real estate markets were sluggish.  Reports from the factory sector were mostly negative, with new layoffs and weaker new orders.  Business and leisure travel weakened.  Contacts reported few instances of rising price pressures.
Manufacturer incentives and lower interest rates have not yet appreciably stimulated District car sales.  Through July, growth in new vehicle registrations was well below the national pace in all District states except Florida.  Dealers selling domestic models reported that August car sales were off from year-ago levels.
Most commercial real estate markets continued to weaken in August.  Sublease space in office and industrial markets was still entering the market at a brisk pace, with widespread use of incentives.  Office, industrial and retail construction and expansions have slowed significantly from last year's strong pace and are expected to remain subdued through year-end.
