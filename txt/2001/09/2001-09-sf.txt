Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicated additional slowing in economic growth during the survey period of August and early September, with limited upward pressure on wages and prices.  Wholesale energy prices have fallen, but retail electricity rates remained high.  Consumer spending softened a bit in most areas.  Continued weak demand was reported by manufacturing contacts, although previously high inventories have been worked down in some sectors, and contacts reported that orders for high-tech equipment may be improving a bit.  Due to uncertainty about future sales, however, manufacturers and other businesses generally focused on maintenance of existing productive capacity, rather than expanding capacity.  In real estate markets, demand for commercial and industrial space remained weak, while demand for residential property was solid in most areas.  District agricultural output was high and prices low.  Lending activity by financial institutions slowed in some areas, as borrowers reduced their demand for credit and banks tightened lending standards on business loans.
Reports regarding demand for consumer and business services were somewhat downbeat.  Employees at law firms in the Pacific Northwest faced ongoing layoffs, especially by firms that focus on corporate finance, and activity in the restaurant trade slowed in California.  However, respondents from Hawaii noted that hotel receipts and other tourist-related commerce held steady or picked up somewhat.
Demand for residential property remained solid in the District, although some areas showed signs of moderation.  Reports indicated that in most areas home purchases continued at a solid pace, due in part to lower mortgage rates.  In Hawaii, apartment rents increased noticeably, due to rising demand combined with limited new construction.  However, contacts noted a slowdown in sales of upper-end homes in California, and in Utah homes were staying on the market longer and sellers showed increased willingness to negotiate on prices and terms.
