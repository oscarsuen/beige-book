The manufacturing sector in the Fourth District is weak. Poor sales during the first two quarters have caused some plant closings, hiring freezes, and layoffs.  On the other hand, consumer spending appears to have  increased  slightly in August and September from the low levels of July. Prices for producer goods and retail products remain flat, as do wages.
Demand for temporary workers has increased slightly from the very low levels of early summer. While demand decreased for highly skilled positions, it remains somewhat strong for warehouse workers, light manufacturing, and office support, especially in legal offices.  Our contacts reported that many positions previously filled by temporary agencies have disappeared because of layoffs and plant closings.  Agencies reported no trouble in finding qualified applicants (and in the last month, they experienced a large increase in the supply of applicants) and generally no pressure to increase wages.  The agencies expect some increase in the demand for workers by the new fiscal year in January.
Our union contacts reported negotiated wage increases of three to four percent for new contracts.  In the steel industry, previously negotiated wage increases were reduced in exchange for new job-security provisions.  All of our union contacts reported that employers are reluctant to hire new workers, and some have negotiated agreements that allow the employer to reduce the number of employees through attrition.
District homebuilders noted a stable residential market.  Although sales of new homes remain flat, home prices have been reduced.  There are fewer backlogs of work, and most of our contacts reported that all of their subcontractors are producing their products on time.
Prices for materials remain generally flat. Employers have been able to hire most trades people far more quickly than last year at this time.  The only trades reported to be in short supply in some regions are masons, framers, and roofers.
Demand for fabricated metal products remains very low.  Sales have decreased 20 percent since last year, and bankruptcy auctions are up 25 percent.  Many of the firms in this industry are experiencing large layoffs.  On the other hand, some of our contacts reported a recent small increase in orders and anticipate that the difficult conditions may improve over the next year.  Rubber and plastics manufacturers are experiencing much smaller demand, especially in the automobile sector, which is seeing declines of up to 30 percent in sales from last year.  Inventories in rubber and plastics are down; some manufacturers would like to achieve even lower inventory levels.  Sales of chemicals are sharply lower than in the spring.
Transportation and shipping companies across the District reported the same level of activity in July and August as in the latter half of the second quarter.  Some items, notably steel, dropped further from the already depressed levels of early summer. Other items, such as electronics and construction goods, are shipping at the weak levels of the beginning of the summer, while retail goods are being shipped at higher levels.  A recent spike in fuel charges during the last few weeks, due to a refinery fire in Chicago, has not resulted in increased shipping prices. As in other sectors of the economy, firms involved in transportation and shipping indicated that it is much easier than last year to secure qualified workers.
Automobile dealers reported that sales of new cars in August were slower than in a fairly strong July.  Sales remain considerably lower than at the same time last year. The decrease is concentrated among domestic brands and luxury cars.  Dealers attributed the softer sales to consumer fears of a declining economy. They also reported strong used car sales as consumers shift from the new car market.  Inventories of new autos are being held at lower levels than last year because many dealers do not expect sales to increase until the spring of 2002.  The demand for boats has declined to about four-fifths of last year's level.  Sales have softened over the last 6-8 weeks, particularly for the large luxury fiberglass craft.
