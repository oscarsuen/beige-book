The Fifth District economy advanced at a modest pace in August and early September, as firmer manufacturing activity accompanied weaker retail sales. The manufacturing sector showed its first evidence of expansion since last fall: shipments rose and capacity utilization stabilized. In contrast, retail sales generally declined in August, though the degree of contraction was less than in July, and automobile sales firmed.  Demand for services continued to grow, but there was added concern about future prospects. Housing sales remained at a generally high level in August and early September, while the construction and leasing of commercial properties weakened somewhat. In labor markets, wage growth picked up at retail and manufacturing firms, but eased at service providers. Price increases remained modest at factories and services firms. Scattered rainfall improved crop development in most areas of the District, except South Carolina, where drought conditions persisted.
Commercial Realtors reported generally weaker leasing activity, but           noted that the pace of the decline had slowed somewhat in recent weeks.           The industrial sector experienced a moderate decline in activity, while           the construction and leasing of retail properties remained flat. A Raleigh,           NC, Realtor reported that he had noticed a decrease in small specialty           shops, but the "usual suspects" (grocery and video stores) were still           going strong. Vacancies of Class A office space generally stabilized,           except in areas with high concentrations of high-tech firms. Commercial           office rents were generally unchanged, but concessions by landlords,           such as a month's free rent, increased markedly. A Columbia, SC, Realtor           reported seeing concessions in the office and industrial sectors for           the first time in years.
