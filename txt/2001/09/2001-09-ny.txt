The District's economy has shown further signs of weakening             since the last report, despite some apparent stabilization in the             manufacturing sector. With energy costs subsiding, overall input price             pressures have eased, and increased competition has kept downward             pressure on selling prices. Labor markets have been fairly stable             since the last report. Most retailers say that sales remained sluggish             in August, with the recent tax rebates reportedly having little effect             on demand; retail inventories are said to be at satisfactory levels,             while selling prices are flat to down slightly. Consumer confidence             fell among residents of downstate New York in August, but rose slightly             in upstate areas.
While home construction and prices are still described             as buoyant, there have been signs of softening in the New York City             area. Office rental markets in and around New York City remain sluggish,             but sales and construction of office buildings remain fairly strong.             Manhattan hotel room rates slipped to a three-year low in August and             were down 7 percent from a year earlier. Finally, bankers report weakening             loan demand, tightening credit standards on all types of loans, and             a significant upturn in delinquencies on home mortgages.
Most retail contacts believe that the recent tax rebates             have not had a significant effect on spending; one estimates a half             a percentage point boost. Contacts generally continue to describe             current inventory levels as satisfactory. Most major chains are now             planning for little or no increase in Christmas season sales, from             last year's levels. Selling prices and merchandise costs were said             to be flat to down modestly.
According to Siena College's latest monthly survey             of New York State residents, consumer confidence in the New York City             area fell in August to the lowest level in the survey's 2 year history.             In upstate New York, however, confidence edged up in August for the             second consecutive month.
The market for existing homes has been mixed in recent             weeks, with some softening reported in and around New York City, but             continued brisk activity in upstate New York. Realtors in the Albany             and Rochester areas report that home sales were robust in August.             In contrast, contacts in both New York City and northern New Jersey             report that while home prices are still well above year-ago levels,             a number of sellers have reduced their asking prices in recent weeks.             Similarly, New York City's apartment market has shown signs of cooling.             Manhattan residential rents, which had risen sharply in recent years,             leveled off in the first half of 2001. Rents in the outer boroughs             also appear to have stabilized and vacancy rates have reportedly edged             up. Manhattan's co-op and condo market, which had remained fairly             strong through mid-year, has taken on a softer tone in recent weeks,             according to a leading real estate firm-unit sales in August were             roughly on par with a year ago, but the average selling price was             down moderately.
Despite continued weakness in commercial real estate             markets, nonresidential construction activity has been brisk. Manhattan's             office market appears to have stabilized somewhat since midyear, as             both rents and availability rates were little changed in July. However,             leasing activity was reported to be down an estimated 70 percent from             a year earlier; while dot-coms were the dominant lessees last year,             most demand this year has come from the media, financial and legal             services industries. Despite the dramatic slackening in the office             rental market, brokers report that selling prices for office buildings             have remained strong, helped by a favorable debt market. Office construction             remains fairly brisk, particularly in northern New Jersey, where the             volume of new construction is reported to be up 80 percent from a             year ago. In addition, overall construction activity is expected to             be buoyed, for some time, by the large volume of long-term infrastructure             projects currently in progress across New York State and New Jersey-particularly             schools, highways, and rail projects.
Manhattan's hotel occupancy rate (seasonally-adjusted),             held steady at 80 percent in July, but was down almost 10 points from             a year earlier. This falling occupancy rate, in part, reflects a 7             percent increase in the number of hotel rooms since the beginning             of the year; current construction will add another 5 percent to the             existing stock. Reflecting the changing market conditions, the average             room rate slipped to a three-year low and is down 7 percent over the             past year.
New York State manufacturers continue to note that             intense competition, largely from overseas, is exerting downward pressure             on selling prices. However, they expressed somewhat less pessimism             about the general business climate in August and early September than             in July. Similarly, purchasing managers in both the Buffalo and New             York City areas report little change in manufacturing activity in             August, along with widespread declines in input prices-notably energy.
On the supply side, tighter credit standards were reported             for all major loan categories. Most notably, more than 30 percent             of bankers say they tightened standards for commercial and industrial             loans and nonresidential mortgages, while none reported an easing.             Widespread declines were reported on all categories of loan rates,             as well as deposit rates. Delinquency rates on consumer loans and             nonresidential mortgages were little changed; however, increased delinquencies             were reported on commercial and industrial loans and, notably, on             residential mortgages. In fact, 21 percent of those surveyed report             rising delinquencies on home mortgages-the highest proportion since             January 1997.
