Economic activity in the District has continued to slow, particularly in the manufacturing sector and in those industries that serve the manufacturing sector.  Retail sales were down in July and August, with sales in both months falling short of retailers' expectations.  Sales of automobiles are down from a year ago, and there has been a shift toward used vehicles.  Overall, retailers and auto dealers have mixed expectations for the immediate future, as the optimistic ones are roughly as numerous as the pessimistic ones.  The residential real estate sector remains the brightest spot of the District economy, as sales volume and prices continue to rise in most of the District.  In contrast, commercial real estate markets have softened.  Total loans by small and mid-sized banks are down slightly, and there is a trend toward stricter loan standards.  Crops appear to be in good-to-excellent condition, with near record-high yields expected in some areas for cotton, corn, and rice.
Auto dealers in the District report that sales were below average for July and August, and that August's sales were noticeably worse than July's.  Most note a shift from new cars to slightly used cars with smaller engines.  A few contacts, however, report strong growth in sales of high-end vehicles.  Almost all note that higher rebates have helped sales, but not as much as some had hoped.  Most contacts are seeing low inventories, especially of used, low-end vehicles.  Expectations are divided: Approximately half of the contacts expect growth while the other half are pessimistic.
Service industries are posting slower growth than last year.  As manufacturing has slowed, the trucking industry has seen less freight, and package handling companies and airlines have seen decreases in volume from a year ago.  As a consequence, these industries have been reducing their workforce and employee hours.  Performance in the technology and finance sectors has been mixed, with some companies cutting back and others expanding.
Despite the general slowdown, employers in much of the District are still having difficulty filling positions with qualified workers.  Some loosening, however, has been noted in the construction in
Residential construction across most of the District has slowed a bit, with monthly building permits down in July.  However, over half of the District's metropolitan areas show year-to-date levels greater than they were a year ago.  Despite a lower number of building permits in July, reports from Memphis show an increase in the total valuation of these new permits.  Private construction is down from a year ago in western Kentucky, but government-sponsored construction remains strong.
In a survey of District senior loan officers, about 20 percent of respondents indicate that their banks have tightened credit standards on C&I loans to large and mid-sized firms; nearly 40 percent of respondents indicate tighter standards on C&I loans to small firms.  All respondents indicate tighter standards for technology companies.  Standards for real estate loans, consumer loans and credit cards are essentially unchanged.
According to initial USDA estimates, corn and soybean yields are expected to decline slightly in the northern parts of the District while increasing in the southern parts of the District, which are rebounding from last year's drought.  Tennessee farmers expect near record-high yields for corn, and Mississippi farmers expect the same for both corn and rice.  In addition, Mississippi farmers expect this fall's cotton crop to be the second-largest ever, with District production increasing by about 30 percent.  Recent persistent wet weather, however, could affect yields for rice and cotton in Mississippi.
