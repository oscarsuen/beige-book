Economic activity continues to be slow in New England.             First District business contacts report sales or orders during the             summer months even with or below year-earlier levels. Some respondents             in manufacturing, temp help, and software say business appears to             be stabilizing at low levels, but others in those industries and retailing             continue to see deterioration. None of the contacted firms expect             conditions to improve until next year, a rather "bleak" consensus             outlook.
Employment levels are reported to be either flat or             declining, with wage rates mostly rising at a 2 to 3 percent pace.             Retail contacts say that they are discounting prices in order to move             inventories; as a result, profit margins are being eroded. Retailers             expect more of the same - flat to negative growth - for the next 12             months. They expect no turnaround in the economy until third quarter             2002. One retailer describes the outlook as "grim."
Makers of consumer goods are anxious about the upcoming             holiday season. They say that consumers appear hesitant to make discretionary             purchases and that retailers are ordering very sparingly in order             to avoid the costs associated with excess stocks. A manufacturer of             consumer instruments is responding to these conditions by not adding             any temporary production help to gear up for its heaviest quarter             of the year. However, one firm supplying computer printer components             is encouraged by signs of fairly robust customer projections for the             holidays, following weak sales for the year to date.
Makers of capital goods continue to report weakness.             They cite a lack of purchases by the semiconductor, steel, domestic             automotive, and telecommunications industries in particular and a             general tightness in capital budgets because of economic uncertainty             and a desire to conserve cash. New orders relate mostly to sectors             that are relatively strong - such as biotech, pharmaceuticals, aerospace,             and oil and gas - and to customers developing improved products. However,             contacts in semiconductor-related industries cite a lack of successful             new technology products as a major obstacle to their recovery.
Respondents say their selling prices and materials             costs generally are flat or down. They cite downward pricing pressures             as a result of intensified use of Internet-based auctions, competition             from imports, and customer-initiated contract renegotiations. Energy             costs are said to be higher than a year ago but stabilizing or coming             down. Manufacturers continue to keep a tight lid on labor and capital             costs, although in some cases they feel they have already made appropriate             reductions. About three-quarters of contacts see employment holding             at current levels through the end of the year, while only one-quarter             anticipate layoffs or furloughs. About one-half of respondents have             intensified efforts to reduce capital expenditures since last contacted             for the Beige Book.
Software and IT respondents report level employment             and capital spending. Most do not expect to reduce employment further             in the near future. They are waiting for improvements in demand before             going ahead with expansion plans.
In high tech sectors such as IT, manufacturing, engineering,             and telecom, large layoffs and hiring freezes continue; very few clients             are hiring tech workers. Office support and accounting are doing better             than high tech, but most contacts report negative growth in these             areas as well. Many contacts report increasing pressure from clients             to lower prices and mark-ups, and hourly rates for IT workers are             down. Finding workers is not a problem; contacts are flooded with             resumes. But some clients are demanding more specific skills and requirements,             making matches more difficult. Many contacts are cutting costs aggressively             and some have laid off up to 25 percent of their own staff, especially             recruiters.
