Economic activity in the Fourth District continued to be weak.  Steel producers and other manufacturers have seen no improvement.  Layoffs have continued, and wage growth has slowed.  Retailers reported flat sales on average.  Commercial construction is flat.   On the other hand, there have been some positive developments.  Bankers are beginning to see an increase in loan volume, and residential construction is booming.
Shipments of flat-rolled steel hit their lowest level since 1992 in the first quarter of 2001.  Contacts were most concerned with low prices, which they attributed to excess capacity and cheap foreign imports.  Most mills are focused on reducing working capital and costs and plan no major capital spending for this year.  High-performance specialty steel for aerospace, oil and gas, and electrical machinery is a rare bright spot in the industry.  Demand from this market segment is expected to remain strong over the next few quarters.
On the positive side, auto dealers reported that their sales were much better in March and April than at the beginning of the year.  On average, car sales for March are about the same as they were for March of last year.  However, truck sales, both new and used, have done very poorly this year.  Sales have been dependent on dealer incentives; the best selling models tend to be the ones with the most generous incentives.  Overall, contacts observed that inventories have returned to a more desirable level.
Organized labor contacts reported either no change or only slight increases in wages in March and early April.  Wages for temporary workers, which may be more attuned to instantaneous market conditions, are said to have been flat or, in some cases, falling over this period.
There are a few signs that conditions may begin to improve.  One contact noted that the automobile industry layoffs that occurred from late December to early February had been "small and targeted" and may be, for the most part, finished.  As evidence, he noted that some laid-off employees already have been recalled and that overtime has picked up.
In contrast, District homebuilders reported a significant improvement in their economic circumstances.  One homebuilder reported selling more homes in the first quarter than in any other first quarter in his nearly 25-year history in business.  Other homebuilders echoed these remarks, noting that their first quarter sales were also as good as or better than those of the first quarter of 2000.  Builders credited the strong market to lower-end and mid-range homebuyers, who appear to be taking advantage of lower interest rates.  Margins have remained steady, with land and lumber prices flat to falling and labor available.
Only one bank tightened its lending standards from March to mid-April; the rest reported that their standards were unchanged.  Delinquency rates have increased slightly, but not at an alarming rate.  Agricultural lenders noted that farmers are keeping current on their payments, but they are not making large capital expenditures or requests for loans.
Shippers generally do not expect a significant increase in activity until August or September at the earliest.  They reported that higher fuel prices and clients' credit difficulties are growing industry problems.
