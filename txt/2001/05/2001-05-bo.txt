Economic activity is slowing in the First District.  With the exception of the tourist industry, contacted retailers say sales in the first quarter were flat to down from a year ago.  Similarly, more than one-half of manufacturing respondents indicate recent sales or orders are down or flat compared with a year earlier.  The residential real estate market remains healthy, constrained mostly by lack of inventory.  Contacts report that hiring has become somewhat easier and wage pressures have lessened.  Both retailers and manufacturers say they are not raising prices.
Employment levels are mostly said to be holding steady, with only a few retailers selling discount goods or autos reporting lay-offs.  Labor markets have loosened and wages are now said to be flat, no longer rising.  Retail contacts say they are holding their prices level and they are seeing only sporadic increases in vendor prices.  Efficiency improvements are reducing costs for many retailers, with margins said to be increasing slightly.
Retailers have turned cautious, with the majority of contacts saying that they do not intend to expand their operations in 2001.  Contacts expect economic growth to be slow for the entire first half.  Looking ahead to the second half of 2001, retailers are uncertain and anxious.  They are concerned that recent stock market declines could severely affect consumer sentiment, yet they see consumers continuing to be buoyed by New England's high employment levels.
Manufacturers supplying the semiconductor industry report that demand has weakened; they are bracing for a continued slump in the second half of the year.  Makers of automotive parts say revenues are down as much as 15 percent from a year ago, but some see evidence of business stabilizing at these lower levels.  Consumer products companies say sales are flat or down; overseas business is particularly weak.  By contrast with these declines, orders for aircraft parts, medical equipment, and products for the electric power industry are said to be increasing at strong double-digit rates.  Sales of some types of computer-related equipment are up considerably from a year ago, but the increases are not as strong as they were last year.
Citing a weakening in revenues or the risk of an economic downturn, many manufacturers report new efforts to reduce costs.  Roughly two-thirds are tightening their belts with respect to capital spending.  They are adopting more stringent criteria for payback periods and stretching out or deferring investment projects.  The majority of contacts have implemented layoffs or are considering layoffs in the near future.  Firms that are hiring generally say that the number of available applicants has increased and their compensation expectations have become more reasonable, although some engineering and information technology positions remain challenging to fill.
Respondents indicate that materials costs are generally flat or down; far fewer express concern about energy or transportation costs than in the last Beige Book.  Selling prices are said to be mostly flat or down.  Large customers in the retail, automotive, and aircraft industries are pushing for price reductions.
In Massachusetts, the pace of shrinkage in inventory has abated.  Most contacts report moderate price increases.  The average sale price in Massachusetts rose by 10 percent between February 2000 and February 2001, less of a year-over-year increase than in previous months, mainly as a result of fewer high-end sales.  Contacts hope to see an increase in supply and anticipate an active market in the next few months.
Capital spending plans have not changed much since our previous conversations in January.  One contact says that they are taking advantage of soft demand for computers and accompanying reduced prices to replace all of their office computers.  Another large company, by contrast, indicates that all capital projects are going to be put on hold because of questions about the economy.  The rest say that they are not making any changes to their short-term or long-term capital expenditures.
