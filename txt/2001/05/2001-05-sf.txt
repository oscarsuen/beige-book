Twelfth District contacts reported continued expansion of the District economy in March and early April, although increased evidence of slowing was observed.  Respondents noted less pressure on costs for many non-energy inputs, along with sharp declines in prices for semiconductors.  District retailers continue to record weaker than projected sales and noted resistance of consumers to price increases.  The energy situation remains critical in the West--respondents expressed concern about escalating energy prices and the threat of supply disruptions in coming months.  Higher energy prices have affected production at a few energy-intensive businesses, adding to the more general weakening in the manufacturing sector.  Investment spending is being curtailed in most sectors, with the notable exception of the energy sectors.  Respondents indicated that commercial real estate is showing signs of softening in markets with concentrations of high-tech manufacturing and Internet services.  The agricultural sector continues to be hurt by low prices and an inability to pass along higher energy costs.  District respondents noted that the demand for credit has fallen slightly and credit standards have tightened.
Energy costs for businesses and consumers are up sharply, and recently approved electricity rate hikes will push prices up further in coming months.  Since the last survey, respondents reported more frequent examples of higher energy costs being passed along to consumers.  The increases often were in the form of energy surcharges added to prices of manufactured goods, charges for freight, and bills for services, including hotel accommodations.  In contrast, contacts noted that suppliers of agricultural goods and wood products are not able to pass along higher energy costs to consumers.  Respondents reported increased conservation efforts to limit the impact of higher energy prices on overall costs.  A small number of contacts either have added or plan to add backup generators to minimize the cost of potential disruptions.
District contacts reported that Southern California tourist traffic continued to increase in recent months, although some signs of slowing are evident elsewhere in the region.  Respondents from Hawaii noted a slight decline in year-to-date visitor days through February; the softening was attributed to slowing in the national economy and weakening in Asia.  Respondents from Las Vegas reported disappointing gaming revenue figures for February.
District contacts indicated a widespread slowing this year in the pace of business investment spending due to excess capacity and inventories as well as less profit potential in a slowing economy.  A number of businesses plan to reduce the growth in spending, while others are cutting their capital investment budgets.  Respondents said that many businesses were cutting back expenditures on computers, information processing equipment, and software.  Reductions were described as significant or substantial by some respondents.  On the other hand, high energy prices are expected to spur investment in oil and natural gas exportation, energy transmission, and electricity generation.
Residential housing market conditions roughly reflect the pattern evident in the commercial sector.  Respondents indicated that some regions were exhibiting some signs of moderation in March.  Contacts noted that apartment vacancy rates were rising and rents were falling in the San Francisco Bay Area.  A slowdown in residential sales also was recorded in the state of Washington.  On the other hand, Hawaii continued to show strength in most residential markets.
