Almost all districts report a slow pace of economic activity in March and early April.  Retail sales were weak in March, but strengthened in April.  Still, retailers in most districts are expecting only small gains, at best, in upcoming months.  Vehicle sales have been mixed, with demand for new SUVs, trucks and luxury cars generally down.  Industrial activity has continued to weaken, with orders and production having fallen in many districts.  Labor market tightness has eased in almost every district.  Upward wage pressures have generally abated, only to be replaced with energy costs that have risen sharply.  Home sales and new construction have remained steady or been picking up in almost all districts.  Commercial construction has been more uneven across districts.  Lower mortgage rates have spurred a resurgence of refinancing, which has helped bolster loan growth recently.  Many districts note, however, that credit standards are tighter now than previously.  The winter wheat crop is generally in good condition, while some delays in spring plantings and the development of other crops have been noted in the Midwest and Plains.  The energy sector continues to strengthen.
Vehicle sales are mixed around the country.  The Cleveland, Kansas City, New York and Philadelphia districts report that sales are up, while the Chicago, Dallas, Richmond and St. Louis districts report that they are down.  Almost across the board, however, districts note that higher gas prices appear to have reduced demand for new SUVs, luxury vehicles and trucks.  On the other hand, sales of lower-priced and used vehicles have been relatively strong, especially in the Dallas and St. Louis districts and in the Buffalo region.  Dealers in the Richmond district have been trimming their inventories as sales have softened; some dealers in the Dallas and St. Louis districts also report high inventories, especially of SUVs and trucks.  In other districts, current vehicle inventories are at desired levels.
The high-tech and telecommunications industries are experiencing a pronounced slowdown.  Activity has eased in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia, San Francisco and St. Louis districts, where new orders or sales of computer-related equipment have dropped.  Sales of such equipment in the Boston district, however, are up moderately.  The Atlanta and Dallas districts still have excess inventories of telecommunications equipment.
There were some scattered areas of improvement, however.  In New York, for example, conditions varied across the state:  the New York City and Buffalo areas have been bright spots, with manufacturers experiencing an increase in production; the Rochester area reports further weakening in business conditions.  Tourism and hospitality demand have remained moderately strong in the Atlanta and Richmond districts, where the Easter holiday and spring breaks during March and April were a boon for these industries.  Business travel, however, is reportedly down, with travel-industry contacts in the Philadelphia district reporting some slowing recently.
Manufacturing contacts in the Cleveland and Philadelphia districts are optimistic, expecting orders and demand to pick up by this summer.  Boston, Chicago and St. Louis district contacts are uncertain to pessimistic, with expectations of slower sales in the coming months.  Businesses in most districts expect a slowing in capital spending this year; in the Philadelphia district, however, the number of firms planning reductions is offset by an equal number planning increases in capital spending budgets.
Upward wage pressures have generally abated.  Wages are rising very moderately or are unchanged in most parts of the country except the Richmond and San Francisco districts, where scattered wage increases are noted.  Retail prices are steady in most districts except Richmond, where retail prices have been rising at a quicker pace in recent weeks.  By and large, non-energy input costs are stable, with only a few exceptions.  Manufacturing materials prices in the Chicago and Kansas City districts, for example, continue to rise, while construction materials prices in the Minneapolis district have decreased somewhat.  The Dallas district is experiencing downward price pressures for metals and high-tech products.  The Atlanta and Chicago districts note increases in health insurance costs.
Commercial construction across districts is a bit more uneven.  The Philadelphia district reports that, despite strong activity, contract awards have recently declined.  The San Francisco district notes that overall activity remains sound, even though vacancy rates are up and rental rates are down in some regions of the district.  The Kansas City district indicates that activity is flat and that sales and leasing have fallen.  The Dallas district is experiencing a slowing in commercial construction, with demand for all types of nonresidential space down.  Construction in areas of the Cleveland district are stagnant, with many firms reportedly putting expansion plans on hold indefinitely.  In the St. Louis district, however, contractors indicate that there has been a consistent flow of new projects, a trend they are optimistic will continue.
Half of the districts--Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, New York and San Francisco--are reporting tighter credit standards, particularly for business loans; the Cleveland district, however, reports that credit standards have remained essentially unchanged.  The Richmond district notes that lenders have become more cautious when making loans to marginally profitable businesses.  The Kansas City district reports deposit growth in line with loan growth; the St. Louis district reports stronger deposit growth than loan growth.
The energy sector continues to strengthen in the Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis districts.  In the Kansas City district, the count of active oil and gas rigs has risen to its highest level in 10 years; in the Minneapolis district, oil and gas exploration has remained above year-ago levels in response to higher prices.  Shortages of equipment and personnel are reported in the Dallas and Kansas City districts, and mining production is decreasing in the Minneapolis district because of softening demand and high energy costs.
