The Tenth District economy remained sluggish in March. Retail sales were flat, manufacturing activity slowed further, and commercial construction was unchanged from previous surveys.  On the positive side, energy activity continued to boom, and residential construction edged higher following months of weakness.  In the farm economy, recent rainfall improved prospects for the winter wheat crop while delaying the planting of spring crops. District labor markets showed additional signs of easing, although they remained generally tight. The pace of wage increases also slowed.  Retail prices held steady, while prices for some manufacturing materials continued to rise.
