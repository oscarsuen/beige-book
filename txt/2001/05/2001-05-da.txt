Eleventh District economic activity decelerated in March and early April.  Contacts in most industries expect activity to remain sluggish throughout the year.  Manufacturing activity continued to decline, and demand for business services weakened.  Retailers said sales were weak or declined in March, with a slight pickup in early April.  Financial service contacts say credit standards are tighter. Construction activity has softened, except in Houston.  The energy industry continues to be a bright spot, although activity is still restrained by shortages of crews and equipment.  The livestock industry is in good shape, but many farmers face high costs and low product prices.
Sales of high-tech products continued to decline over the past 30 days, according to manufacturers, although some reported signs of flattening out.  Sales have been weak in the U.S. and, more recently, Asia.  Inventories of cell phones are high, and some say the inventory on hand is becoming obsolete.  Inventories remained under control for many other products, such as for personal computers and some semiconductors such as logic chips and power sources.  Contacts expect employment levels to continue to fall and capital investment to be significantly lower this year than in 2000.
Metals and paper producers also reported weaker demand since the last Beige Book.  Some steel mills have reduced production by as much as 50 percent.  Strong demand for metal products used in the oil field has slightly mitigated the negative effects of widespread slowing.  Paper production has also been cut to return inventories to manageable levels, and prices have fallen.
Petrochemical producers are facing the worst market conditions in 15 years, and several large producers have declared bankruptcy.  Natural gas prices doubled over the past year (a critical input to manufacturing petrochemicals), international demand has dropped and considerable new capacity is coming on line.  For instance, eight billion pounds of ethylene capacity is coming on line in 2001--twice the biggest previous increment of new capacity in industry history.
Refiners ran their plants hard for two to three years, but refining margins weakened substantially in March.  A number of refineries went into extended maintenance and have been slow to return.  The result was a late switch to gasoline, and its inventories are running four to five percent below the extraordinarily low levels of last year.  Wholesale spot prices for regular unleaded gasoline spiked from 76 to 96 cents over the past six weeks.  Refiners' margins became very strong, giving them a powerful incentive to get facilities back on line and produce more gasoline.
