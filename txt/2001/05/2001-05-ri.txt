The Fifth District economy expanded at a modest pace in the weeks since our last report. Retail sales were somewhat lower in March, but strengthened noticeably in recent weeks.  Revenue growth at services firms picked up appreciably in March and April.  The manufacturing sector, however, continued to struggle; shipments and new orders declined further since our last report.  Favorable mortgage rates boosted home sales and refinancing activity in recent weeks, but commercial real estate activity softened somewhat.  In agriculture, ample rainfall provided excellent conditions for spring planting and small grain crops were reported to be in generally good condition.
Commercial realtors across the District noted somewhat weaker leasing and construction activity in recent months.  Leasing activity was generally slower in the retail and office sectors. Large blocks of office space went back onto the market in northern Virginia and the District of Columbia because of weaker demand by high-tech firms.  Class A office space remained generally tight in major metropolitan areas, although there were pockets of easing.  A number of contacts reported lower office and retail rental rates.  Commercial construction activity remained steady with very few speculative projects on line.
