The pace of District economy activity has continued to slow, particularly in the manufacturing sector, with reports of falling demand and cuts in employment.  Employment in the retail trade and services sectors, on the other hand, has increased recently.  Expectations in most sectors are for some upticks in both employment and demand sometime this summer.  Retail sales have shown only modest gains in March and April, although April has been somewhat stronger than March.  Real estate markets have been the bright spot, with sales of existing homes and construction of new homes picking up after a slow start to the year.  Low mortgage rates are often cited as boosting sales and construction.  Loan growth has remained modest, while deposit growth has picked up recently.  Excessive rain and wide temperature fluctuations have delayed spring planting and new crop emergence.
Car dealers report that March and April sales are down 5 percent on average over the same period last year.  Many cite low consumer confidence and high gasoline prices as causes. Higher-priced vehicles, such as luxury cars and SUVs, are posting the slowest sales, while lower-priced and used vehicles are moving faster.  Half of the dealers report that inventories are at desired levels.  Dealers with excess inventories state that trucks, SUVs and luxury vehicles are the ones sitting on the lots.  Most contacts expect moderate sales growth during the summer, though high gas prices may hinder sales of all but fuel-efficient models.
High energy costs remain a major concern for many industries.  Hit especially hard have been small trucking companies and freight haulers, which are experiencing substantial profit losses because of high diesel prices.  Labor shortage concerns are waning, as most contacts note that workers have been readily available in the last few months.
With some signs that consumer confidence is on the rise, contacts in many industries are anticipating moderate upticks in employment growth and demand by this summer.  Most manufacturers, however, remain cautious because slowing demand has been the trend for several months now.
Residential construction has been mirroring sales recently, with monthly building permit levels up in almost all District metropolitan areas in February.  Year-to-date permit levels through February in most District metro areas, however, are down from the same period in 2000, which had started out relatively strong.  Commercial contractors report that the recent flow of new projects has been steady, a trend they are optimistic will continue.
Soil moisture levels are closer to normal this year than a year ago, with all District states reporting adequate-to-surplus topsoil moisture.  Boosted by abundant moisture levels, the winter wheat crop in all areas is in good-to-excellent condition.
