Economic activity in the Seventh District remained slow in March and the first few weeks of April.  Consumer spending picked up modestly in early to mid-April, after a generally soft early spring.  Real estate and construction markets were active, but growth remained slow.  Manufacturing activity was again weak, but contacts reported that some of the huge inventory overhangs that led to slower production had been substantially reduced.  Lower interest rates spurred mortgage refinancing activity, while demand for business loans softened somewhat.  The District's labor markets continued to develop slack as the region's unemployment rate topped the national average for the first time in nearly a decade.  Spring planting was underway and progressing at a normal pace, but flooding along the Mississippi may cause some delays, and may result in disruptions to the flow of grain shipments out of northern terminals.  Upward wage pressures continued to subside, while non-wage costs, particularly for medical coverage, remained a concern for small businesses.  With the exception of energy costs, price increases at both the producer and retail levels remained subdued.
