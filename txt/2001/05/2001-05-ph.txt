Third District business conditions were mixed in April, although there were some signs that consumer spending was strengthening.  Manufacturers saw further declines in orders, but shipments were steady.  General merchandise sales rose slightly in mid-April after several weeks of easing.  Auto sales also improved somewhat.  Bank loan volumes outstanding have been rising slightly, mainly because of small gains in commercial and industrial lending.  Residential real estate activity remains fairly high, but commercial leasing has eased.  Service sector activity remains somewhat below the level achieved around the beginning of the year.
The consensus forecast among the businesses contacted for this report is that overall economic activity will move up slowly in the months ahead.  Manufacturers in general expect an increase in orders within the next six months, although not for all the industrial sectors in the region.  Retailers anticipate marginal gains in sales for the rest of this year compared with last year.  Bankers anticipate minor increases in business and consumer lending, but they expect some falloff in demand for real estate loans.  Capital spending among area firms has been pared back, for the most part, although electric utilities are proceeding with expansion plans
Manufacturers continue to face high costs for fuels and electricity.  They report that their ability to raise prices for their products is limited by competition from Asian and European firms that benefit from the low value of their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.  In addition, several firms indicated that their major customers were looking for price reductions as a condition of further purchases.
Manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the next six months.  Firms in all major industrial sectors except chemicals, transportation equipment, and instruments expect increases in orders.  Despite the forecasted increase in business, area manufacturers project no rise in order backlogs.  The region's manufacturers intend to limit capital expenditures, on balance.  Nearly half of those contacted for this report will maintain steady rates of capital spending during the next six months, and the number of firms planning increases is offset by an equal number reducing capital spending budgets.
Store executives generally forecast very slight growth in sales during the rest of the year.  Although most retailers described their inventories as appropriate for the current sales rate, many have reduced the level of inventories they plan to hold for the balance of the year.  Some retailers have also indefinitely postponed plans to remodel stores.
Auto dealers indicated that sales had picked up in recent weeks. Manufacturers' incentives remain extensive.  Dealer inventories were generally in line with sales, and dealers were ordering cars from makers only as needed to keep up with current demand.  Most of the dealers contacted in late April said they expect sales for the remainder of the year to be steady at a pace about 5 to 10 percent below last year's rate.
Bankers in the Third District expect overall loan volumes to increase slightly this year.  They anticipate modest increases in business lending and slow growth in consumer loans.  In general, they expect some easing in demand for real estate loans, both residential and commercial.  However, there appears to be some increased interest in commercial real estate lending in the region by nonbank financial institutions.
