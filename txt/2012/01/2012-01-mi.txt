The Ninth District economy grew at a modest pace since the last report. Solid   growth was reported in some areas of consumer spending and in the energy and   mining sectors. Slight to moderate growth was noted in commercial and   residential real estate, professional services, manufacturing, and agriculture.   Activity in the construction sector was down from a year ago, while the   unexpected lack of snowfall dampened tourism. Labor markets showed continued   signs of modest strengthening, while wage increases remained subdued. Prices   generally remained level.
Consumer spending increased   during the holiday season. Holiday sales at a Minneapolis area mall were up more   than 10 percent compared with a year ago. Sales at a North Dakota mall during   late November and December were up about 8 percent over last year. A mall   manager in Montana noted heavy traffic at the mall during the week before   Christmas and the day after Christmas. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based   retailer increased about 2 percent in November compared with a year ago; Black   Friday sales were particularly strong. A Minnesota-based sporting goods store   reported that Internet sales on Cyber Monday (Nov. 28) increased 50 percent over   last year. Warm weather set back some sales of winter apparel, but clear roads   allowed shoppers to get to stores. A domestic auto dealer reported strong sales   in December.
Tourism activity was down. A lack of snow and surprisingly warm weather   stymied snowmobiling, ice fishing, and skiing in many areas. Tourism officials   in Minnesota noted that the lack of snow was affecting businesses that cater to   winter recreation. Low snowfall in Yellowstone National Park was affecting   nearby businesses that offer winter tours of the park on snowmobiles and in   snowcoaches. However, a ski resort in Minnesota reported strong preseason sales;   the number of visits through the end of December was at expected levels. In   western South Dakota, a snowmobiling-related business and a ski resort both have   received calls from a number of people who are ready to visit once more snow   falls.
Commercial construction   activity decreased modestly over the past year. The value of commercial building   permits in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area was down slightly in November from   November 2010. Respondents to the University of St. Thomas's semiannual   Minnesota Commercial Real Estate Survey (November) expected higher land and   building costs, which should dampen construction. However, several commercial   construction projects are under way or planned in Montana. Residential   construction decreased from last year. The number of permitted residential units   in the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Sioux Falls, and Billings, Mont., areas was down in   November from a year ago, but increased in Fargo, N.D.
Commercial real estate market activity increased. According to the   aforementioned University of St. Thomas survey, respondents expected growth in   rents and occupancy but flat rates of return on investment. Industrial real   estate activity increased since the last report, according to a large Minnesota   commercial broker. Home sales in December were up from the same period a year   ago in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and the inventory of homes for sale was at   six-year lows; however, prices continued to decline. In the Sioux Falls area,   November new listings were down, sales activity was flat, and prices decreased   from a year ago.
Activity at professional business services firms   increased since the last report. An information technology consulting firm noted   a solid backlog of business for 2012. An architectural firm noted more potential   projects up for bid, but said many projects never become reality. An accounting   firm reported flat activity over the past month.
The District manufacturing sector expanded   slightly since the last report. A November survey of purchasing managers by   Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) found that manufacturing activity increased   in Minnesota and North Dakota, and was flat in South Dakota. A number of factory   expansions were reported in eastern South Dakota, including at a plastics   producer and a packaging firm. In southern Minnesota, a firm that produces   pressurized storage tanks for the natural gas industry is expanding into a   currently empty building, and a large plant that makes electronically shaded   glass began operations after several years of development.
Activity in the energy and mining   sectors continued to increase. A new wind energy project was announced in   western Wisconsin. While District oil and gas exploration activity decreased   slightly since the last report, it remained well above year-earlier levels. An   oil transport facility expansion is planned in North Dakota that will add a rail   car loading area and increase holding capacity by 80,000 barrels per day. Mining   activity remained strong. A new venture on Minnesota's Iron Range to extract   material for steel production from old mining dumps recently began operations at   one site and made its first shipments; two more sites are planned.
Growth in the agricultural sector moderated,   as some commodity prices declined. Prices received by farmers for wheat, corn,   hogs, and dairy products decreased in December from the previous month. Cattle,   poultry, egg, dry bean, and hay prices increased in December from the previous   month. Meanwhile, a partnership announced the development of a large   grain-loading facility in Minnesota.
Labor markets showed   continued signs of modest strengthening. A pharmacy benefits management company   recently announced plans to add 300 jobs in Minnesota. A bank is hiring almost   80 more workers at a call center in South Dakota. Bank directors noted that in   the Dakotas and some parts of Montana, employers would hire if they could find   workers; some of these employers have started to offer relocation packages as an   incentive. According to a recent survey by an employment services firm, 15   percent of respondents in Minneapolis-St. Paul expect to increase staffing   levels during first quarter 2012, while 8 percent expect to decrease staff. A   year ago, 10 percent expected to increase hiring, while 6 percent expected   decreases. Minnesota initial claims for unemployment benefits decreased 18   percent in November compared with a year earlier.
Wage increases were subdued. Several contacts noted small wage increases at   their firms. A Minnesota manufacturer of residential windows reported that its   employees will go without an annual bonus for the third straight year, but the   company also hasn't laid anyone off during those three years.
Prices generally remained level. End-of-December Minnesota gasoline prices   were flat since the last report, and only 18 cents per gallon more than a year   ago. Overall metals prices were level since the last report and lower than a   year ago. A Minnesota-based electronics retailer heavily discounted products at   its stores during the early part of the holiday shopping season. However, a bank   director noted that a number of District manufacturers were planning to raise   prices in 2012.
