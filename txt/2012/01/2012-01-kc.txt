The Tenth District economy expanded at a modest pace in late November and   December. Consumer spending softened, with weakness in auto, restaurant, and   tourism sales. District manufacturing activity contracted slightly, though   factory operators remained optimistic about growth in the coming months.   High-tech firms reported continued strong growth, while transportation activity   was flat. Residential and commercial real estate conditions remained broadly   weak, but contacts expressed increased optimism about sales and prices in the   coming months. District banks reported generally steady loan demand and improved   loan quality. High crude oil prices buoyed activity in the District's energy   sector. Agricultural growing conditions improved, but higher input and   production costs constrained farm profits. Rising input costs were reported in   several sectors, but few District contacts noted either hiring shortages or wage   pressures.
