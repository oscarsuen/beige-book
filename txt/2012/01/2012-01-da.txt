The Eleventh District economy grew at a moderate pace since the last report.   Manufacturing activity was mixed. Contacts said retail sales were robust and   automobile sales held steady. Demand for business services was solid, and   activity in transportation services rose modestly. Housing and commercial real   estate markets continued to improve slightly. Construction activity remained   subdued, with apartment construction being the major exception. Financial   services respondents said overall loan demand was flat to up slightly. Energy   activity slowed somewhat, but respondents expect strong growth in activity in   2012. Agricultural conditions remained weak. Employment levels were mostly   unchanged. Price and wage pressures were subdued.
The price of WTI moved in a narrow range between $95 and $100 per barrel   during the reporting period. Natural gas prices remained low, near $3.50 per   thousand cubic feet, due to unseasonably warm weather and large inventories.   Diesel and gasoline prices declined by 20 cents per gallon over the past six   weeks, and prices of petrochemicals and plastics held steady or fell   slightly.
Respondents in high-tech manufacturing reported that sales grew at a weak to   moderate pace since the last report. Sales and prices for DRAM continued to be   very weak, while demand and prices for processors were holding up much better.   Respondents said that increased demand for mobile devices and data storage   should drive up demand for semiconductors by the second quarter of 2012.   Respondents noted, however, that economic uncertainty remains very high.
Conditions in the paper industry were mixed. Most contacts noted weakness,   although one reported an unusually busy December with strong orders from the   auto and construction industries. Respondents expect conditions to remain about   the same in 2012 as in 2011. Automobile and aviation equipment manufacturers   said demand had picked up slightly since the last report. Expectations are for   stronger sales of automobile equipment in 2012, but aviation manufacturers   expect only modest growth. Food producers noted a pickup in demand since the   last report, in part due to stronger consumer demand, and partly due to   increased market share. Outlooks among food industry contacts remain   positive.
Petrochemical producers noted a seasonal slowdown in demand for most   products. Producers of plastics and plastic feedstocks said prices and   inventories stabilized after sharp declines in October and November. Demand for   chlorine showed weakness beyond the normal seasonal slowing, and some contacts   attributed the weakness to slower global growth. Contacts in the refining   industry noted weak domestic consumption of refined products, especially   gasoline, although export markets were still strong. Inventories were said to be   near expectations for this time of year. While both gasoline and diesel prices   slipped over the past six weeks, refiners' margins remained at healthy levels,   according to contacts.
Automobile sales held steady from the prior report and have increased   year-over-year. The used car market remains tight. Contacts expect 2012 will be   another good year, with moderate increases in sales. Vehicle inventories are   back to normal levels for the most part, although some contacts reported light   inventories due to increased activity.
Reports from transportation service firms were positive. Intermodal firms   reported steady cargo volumes during the reporting period, and outlooks are   positive for the first half of 2012. Railroad firms noted a broad-based increase   in shipments, with particularly strong growth in petroleum products, motor   vehicles and equipment, nonmetallic minerals, crushed stone, metals and metallic   ores. Small parcel shipments rose strongly during the reporting period.
Airlines reported steady passenger demand over the past six weeks. Domestic   demand and travel to Latin America remained solid, and travel to Europe and Asia   improved slightly. Airline contacts expect demand to remain stable in the short   term.
Conditions in nonresidential property markets continue to firm,   according to most contacts. Demand for office space continued to rise modestly   since the last report, and there were some reports of improvement in demand for   warehouse and retail space. Nonresidential construction activity remains at low   levels, and some contacts noted concern about 2012 as public projects come to a   close. One contact noted that while conditions have improved overall, real   estate financing remains a challenge due to weak consumer sentiment and higher   investment risk.
