Growth in the Second District's economy has picked up somewhat since the last   report. Labor market conditions have been stable to slightly stronger in recent   weeks, and a sizable number of contacts say they plan to add workers in the   months ahead. While consumer prices generally remain steady, business contacts   in a number of industries indicate rising cost pressures. Manufacturers report   steady improvement in business conditions. Most retailers and auto dealers   describe sales as steady but strong in February and the first few weeks of   March. Tourism activity has been mixed but generally strong since the last   report, with bookings for the months ahead described as robust. Home sales   activity has continued to strengthen since the last report, though prices have   been steady to somewhat lower; rental markets have continued to improve, and   there has been a pickup in rental multi-family construction. Commercial real   estate markets remained steady in the first quarter of 2012. Finally, bankers   report increased loan demand, no change in credit standards, and the most   widespread declines in delinquency rates in a number of years. Consumer Spending Retailers report that sales were mixed   but mostly steady and strong in February and the first few weeks of March. One   major retail chain reports that sales were above plan and running more than 5   percent ahead of year earlier in both February and March, led by strength in   spring apparel and accessories. Retail contacts in upstate New York report that   sales in recent weeks have been strong and running roughly on par with a year   earlier, which was also characterized as a very strong period, with continued   strong demand from Canadian shoppers. However, another major retailer indicates   that same-store sales were below plan and down considerably from 2011 levels.   Retail prices continue to be mostly stable, but one major chain notes declining   costs for apparel merchandise. Inventories are generally reported to be at   desired levels. Auto dealers in upstate New York report that sales activity picked up in   February and has remained strong in the first few weeks of March. Sales of new   vehicles were up 4-7 percent from a year earlier in February and remained fairly   strong in March. Inventory stock-outs are no longer a factor holding down sales.   Business generally remains brisk at dealer service departments, although dealers   in the Buffalo area report that unseasonably mild weather has reduced demand for   winter-oriented service. Wholesale and retail credit conditions remain   favorable. The Conference Board's latest survey of residents of the Middle Atlantic   states (NY, NJ, PA) shows confidence slipping moderately in March, though it   remains well above its lows of last October. Tourism activity has been fairly   robust since the last report, and hotel bookings for upcoming months look strong   as well. Albany area hotels report rising occupancy rates in February. New York   City hotels report that total revenues per room were up roughly 6 percent from a   year ago in February and March, with particular strength in the last couple of   weeks. All of the increase reflects higher occupancy rates, as room rates have   leveled off. Moreover, an industry contact notes that advance bookings are very   strong and that room rates are poised to rise. Attendance at Broadway theaters   was fairly robust in February but has tapered off in March, largely because   fewer shows are running than at this time last year; however, revenues continue   to run ahead of 2011 levels, reflecting a substantial rise in ticket prices. Construction and Real Estate Housing markets across much   of the District appear to have picked up since the last report, while rental   markets continue to firm. Home sales are reported to be on the upswing in   northern New Jersey, though prices are steady to declining, largely due to more   distressed properties coming to market. One industry expert notes surprising   strength in new multi-family construction in New Jersey--almost entirely rental   units--thus far in 2012; this segment now accounts for well over 50 percent of   all new homebuilding, which is said to be unprecedented. Apartment rental   markets in both New York City and northern New Jersey continue to firm, with   inventories tight and rents rising steadily. A major New York City appraisal   firm notes that Manhattan's co-op and condo market has firmed since   mid-February: while prices remain flat, sales have picked up--especially for   studio and 1-bedroom co-ops--and new contract activity is estimated to be   running 7 percent ahead of a year earlier. Conditions in the outer boroughs have   been somewhat softer. Real estate contacts in western New York State report   continued gradual improvement in home sales activity but note some downward   pressure on prices. Commercial real estate markets have been mixed but, on balance, steady since   the last report. Office vacancy rates in New York City and on Long Island   declined in the first quarter, while rents have risen moderately. By contrast,   office markets have slackened in northern New Jersey, Westchester and Fairfield   counties, and in Rochester. Most other metro areas in upstate New York have seen   steady to slightly declining vacancy rates. Industrial markets across the   District have been fairly stable. Other Business Activity A major New York City employment   agency specializing in office jobs reports that hiring activity has held steady   since the last report. Legal hiring has picked up somewhat but for specific   positions with specialized qualifications, while finance-sector hiring remains   modest. More broadly, though, a sizable number of manufacturers and a growing   number of business contacts in other sectors say that they plan to step up   hiring activity in the months ahead. Looking at business conditions more generally, manufacturers across New York   State report continued improvement since the last report, while a growing   proportion of non-manufacturing contacts report increases in business activity.   Business contacts in both manufacturing and other sectors report that input   costs are rising; however, selling prices are reported to be holding steady, on   balance. Financial Developments Small to medium-sized banks in the   District report increased loan demand in all categories, but particularly for   commercial mortgages. Bankers indicate increased demand for refinancing but to a   less widespread degree than in recent months. Credit standards are reported to   be little changed across all loan categories. Respondents note a decrease in   spreads of loan rates over the cost of funds for all loan   categories--particularly for commercial and industrial loans where well over two   in five bankers report lower spreads, while none report higher spreads.   Respondents also indicate some decline in average deposit rates. Finally,   bankers report decreases in delinquency rates for all loan categories. Moreover,   the reported decreases are more widespread among our banking contacts than at   any time since the late 1990s.
