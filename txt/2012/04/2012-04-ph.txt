Overall, business activity in the Third District has continued to show slow,   steady improvement since the previous Beige Book. Overall sentiment improved,   and the unseasonably mild weather undoubtedly contributed to this. Since the   last Beige Book, manufacturing activity has grown further, and many   manufacturing industries have contributed to this growth; however, the pace has   slowed slightly. Retail sales continued to grow modestly. Motor vehicle dealers   experienced unseasonably strong sales growth in February, but sales were less   robust in March. Third District banks have reported slight growth in demand and   continued strong credit quality since the last Beige Book. New home construction   continued to improve in Pennsylvania but slowed in New Jersey due to the large   inventory of distressed homes. Little change was seen by commercial real estate   contacts who reported slowly improving markets. Overall, service-sector firms   reported continued growth. Price pressures have remained contained for most   sectors, with little change from the last Beige Book.
The outlook remains relatively optimistic among most firms, similar to the   sentiment expressed in the last Beige Book. Manufacturers' expectations for the   next six months have changed little and remain relatively high. Retailers   continue to expect slow, steady improvement. Auto dealers anticipate continued   strong sales; however, they acknowledge that the robust first quarter might   shave a little off the typical spring seasonal surge. Banking, real estate, and   service-sector firms continue to plan for slow growth in 2012. In general,   business plans remained cautious; however, there was a noticeable lack of the   litany of risks and uncertainties as expressed by contacts over the last six   months.
Since the last Beige Book, Third District   manufacturers have reported continued growth of new orders and shipments,   although the pace has slowed slightly. Gains were widespread among the makers of   food products, lumber and wood products, fabricated metals, industrial   machinery, and instruments. New apartment construction, rising auto sales, and   Marcellus shale activity are driving increased demand, according to various   contacts. A lumber firm expects growth but mostly from market share gains.   Manufacturers of food products and of chemicals expressed concerns about the   impact of rising fuel prices on their input and output prices.
About nine out of 10 Third District manufacturers expect business conditions   to improve or stay the same during the next six months; firms are evenly   divided. Seasonal trends may be responsible for some of the anticipated   improvement, but the optimism is nearly uniform across all major sectors. The   usual litany of risks and uncertainties to the outlook â€“ typical over the past   six months â€“ was virtually absent from current comments by manufacturers.   However, caution remains; expectations of capital spending and future hiring   have changed little since the last Beige Book.
Third District retailers reported modest growth   rates overall but expressed greater certainty that mild weather had played a   significant role in year-over-year comparisons. According to one contact, outlet   malls fared better than broad retail but they should have experienced stronger   sales. Gas prices pinched. While mild weather attracted more people, the average   purchase per store dropped from year-ago levels. Overall, retail contacts see   the economy firming but remain very cautious.
Auto sales were robust in February for dealers in New Jersey and   Pennsylvania. For the first two months of the year, year-over-year sales growth   in New Jersey was reported to be higher than national growth despite a soft   January report. Pennsylvania contacts indicated that March sales were strong but   not as robust as in February. The outlook for auto sales remains strong.   However, contacts indicate that the rapid first quarter pace may somewhat dampen   the spring sales season, which typically peaks in May or June. Modest hiring   continues at select dealers, but caution remains the trend.
Overall, loan demand has continued to grow   slightly in the Third District since the previous Beige Book; however, activity   has been uneven. Mirroring trends noted by other sectors, community banks note   that the strongest loan demand has been for inventories and capital equipment to   manufacturers and for investments in higher education, health care, technology   sectors, and multifamily housing. One large bank contact noted strong demand   from middle-market private equity firms, while the pace of refinancing had   diminished. Most contacts reported solid credit quality.
Since the last Beige Book,   residential builders have reported mixed results for sales â€“ and hence for their   construction activity â€“ depending on the extent of distressed sales activity in   their region. Builders reported slower sales in southern New Jersey â€“ where   foreclosure rates are the highest â€“ but continued apace in Pennsylvania. A   Pennsylvania builder was more encouraged than at any time in the past five   years; the company is doing more hiring for sales and for construction workers.   One contact observed the resumption of heavy flows of specialized construction   trade workers on the roads between Philadelphia area worksites and their   Lancaster area homes; this level of activity has been absent for five years.   Residential brokers reported strong, weather-aided year-over-year sales growth.   The outlook among builders and brokers remains somewhat more positive.
Nonresidential real estate activity has continued to slowly improve since the   last Beige Book, with few changes. The industrial real estate market remains the   strongest, followed by higher education, multifamily residential investment, and   activities related to Marcellus shale. Philadelphia's Center City office market   is characterized by a continuing trend toward consolidations and a growing trend   toward conversions to apartments. The overall outlook for nonresidential real   estate remains positive but modest.
Most Third District service-sector firms have   reported further growth since the last Beige Book. Firms' strongest demand   emanated from higher education and health-care institutions. Hospital systems   reported rising admissions. Staffing firms reported mixed results, with strong   orders from the manufacturing, health-care, and technology sectors. Demand for   general administration and for clerical workers has been softer; however,   clients were beginning to talk of hiring plans. Service-sector firms anticipate   that growth will steadily improve in 2012.
Price levels have changed little since   the previous Beige Book â€“ remaining generally constrained. Some deals and   promotions are beginning to sap strong auto dealer pricing power. This was   anticipated as Japanese automakers resumed normal production levels. New federal   regulations, including medical certification requirements for commercial   drivers, have exacerbated truck driver shortages. Favorable pricing power for   freight shippers will push costs along to their customers and end-users. As a   recent study predicts, these high costs could rise even further if the need   arises to truck fuel to nearby markets that are currently being served by   pipeline from refineries that are being closed. Price pressures have eased   somewhat for manufacturing firms since the last Beige Book. Retailers and   homebuilders continued to report tight margins with high, not rising, nonlabor   factor costs. House prices have fallen further; however, nonresidential rents   are stabilizing in some sectors. Contacts continued to report a lack of wage   pressures, other than for medical benefits.
