The Eleventh District economy grew at a moderate pace over the past six weeks.   Overall manufacturing activity continued to expand. Demand for business services   rose slightly, and transportation services activity remained positive overall.   The housing sector continued to improve modestly, and nonresidential leasing   activity remained solid. Respondents said retail sales grew at a modest pace and   auto sales strengthened. Financial firms noted a modest pickup in loan demand.   Energy activity continued to be strong, although gas-directed drilling activity   weakened. Drought conditions improved. Employment levels were steady to slightly   higher. Prices were unchanged or somewhat higher, according to contacts.   Outlooks across industries remain positive, but more respondents noted concern   about higher energy costs.
The price of WTI averaged $105.95 per barrel during the reporting period.   Natural gas prices fell from $2.50 per thousand cubic feet to below $2.20.   Gasoline prices rose by 34 cents per gallon over the past six weeks, and the   price of diesel rose by 20 cents. Prices of petrochemicals and plastics also   increased since the last report.
Respondents in high-tech manufacturing reported that orders continued to grow   at a modest pace since the last report. According to contacts, key demand   drivers continue to be mobile applications, cloud computing and automobiles. One   contact noted that demand for DRAM memory remains weak relative to supply, while   demand for flash memory and logic devices is generally good. Most respondents   expect demand to continue to grow at a modest pace over the next three to six   months.
Aviation equipment manufacturers said demand weakened during the reporting   period. Contacts were less optimistic in their outlooks for the year, citing   high energy prices and the bankruptcy of several service and maintenance   companies that serve the airline industry. Food producers said sales activity   increased over the past six weeks, and near-term outlooks were positive. Reports   from paper manufacturers were mixed but overall suggested steady to slower   growth in demand. Contacts expect moderate growth for the year.
Petrochemicals producers said planned maintenance outages have tightened   capacity, constrained production and raised the price of ethylene. Capacity was   reduced by closures during the recession, and new modern plants will not be on   line for several years. The pass-through of higher ethylene prices has weakened   export demand for petrochemical products including polyethylene. Gulf Coast   refiners noted steady margins overall since the last report.
Automobile sales showed strength in late February which continued through the   first half of March. Contacts noted that customer concern over gas prices   remains muted at this point, but they have seen more interest in smaller   vehicles recently. The outlook for sales remains optimistic.
Reports from transportation service firms were mixed. Intermodal firms   reported an increase in cargo volumes buoyed by shipments of oil field supplies.   Small parcel shipments increased, while air cargo volumes and railroad shipments   declined during the reporting period. Airlines reported solid passenger demand   over the past six weeks. Domestic air travel increased, while international air   travel demand was flat. Contacts said customers remained price sensitive and   were purchasing restricted discount fares. Airline contacts expect passenger   demand to remain stable or improve in the near-term.
Office and industrial leasing activity continued to improve. Contacts noted   that the energy and high tech sectors were driving much of the demand for space.   Sales of nonresidential investment properties were unchanged over the past six   weeks. Respondents noted some trepidation among investors, even though capital   is widely available. The one exception was apartment properties, which remain   popular among investors according to contacts.
