Overall lending at a sample of small and   medium-sized District banks was essentially unchanged during the three-month   period from mid-December to mid-March.
Reports of   plans for manufacturing activity have been mixed since our previous report.   Several manufacturers announced plans to increase operations and hire workers,   while a similar number of contacts reported plans to close plants and lay off   workers in the near future.
