Prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland based on   information collected on or before April 2, 2012. This document summarizes   comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve   and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.
Reports   from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that the economy continued   to expand at a modest to moderate pace from mid-February through late March.   Activity in the Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts   grew at a moderate pace, while Cleveland and St. Louis cited modest growth. New   York reported that economic growth picked up somewhat. Philadelphia and Richmond   cited improving business conditions. The economy in Minneapolis grew at a solid   pace and Kansas City's economy expanded at a faster pace.
Manufacturing continued to expand in most Districts, with gains noted in   automotive and high-technology industries. Manufacturers in many Districts   expressed optimism about near-term growth prospects, but they are somewhat   concerned about rising petroleum prices. Demand for professional business   services showed modest to strong growth and freight volume was mainly higher.   Reports on retail spending were positive, with the unusually warm weather being   credited for boosting sales in several Districts. While the near-term outlook   for household spending was encouraging, contacts in several Districts expressed   concerns that rising gas prices could limit discretionary spending in the months   to come. New-vehicle sales were reported as strong or strengthening across much   of the United States. Tourism increased in most reporting Districts. Residential   real estate showed some improvement, with many contacts citing expansion in the   construction of multi-family housing. Activity in nonresidential real estate   increased or held steady in most Districts. Agricultural conditions were   generally favorable. Mining activity expanded and oil extraction rose, while   natural gas drilling slowed. Banking conditions were largely stable, with some   improvement seen in loan demand. Several Districts reported increased credit   quality.
Hiring was steady or showed a modest increase across many Districts.   Difficulty finding qualified workers, especially for high-skilled positions, was   frequently reported. Upward pressure on wages was constrained. Overall price   inflation was modest. However, contacts in many Districts commented on rising   transportation costs due to higher fuel prices.
Manufacturers in Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago are expanding payrolls but   finding it difficult to find highly-skilled workers. Comments from the   Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts indicated a rise in   capital spending. Manufacturers in over half the Districts commented on   increasing input costs, focusing, in particular, on rising petroleum prices.   Contacts in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco   remained optimistic that activity will increase in the near term. However,   several respondents in Cleveland and Dallas noted that their outlooks have   become more cautious. Manufacturers in Boston and Cleveland expressed concern   about the European economy. Expectations were mixed in St. Louis.
Automobile sales were reported as stronger or strengthening during late   February and early March in most Districts. Mild winter weather boosted sales in   Cleveland but depressed motor vehicle service spending in New York and   Minneapolis. Rising gas prices lead to increased purchases of fuel-efficient   vehicles in Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Contacts in Philadelphia and   Kansas City expect continued sales strength. Reports from Cleveland showed a   mixed outlook, with some respondents expecting solid sales and others seeing the   current pace of sales as unsustainable. Used-vehicle sales were reported as   strong or robust in Cleveland and San Francisco.
Tourism was characterized as strong by respondents in the Boston, New York,   Richmond, and Atlanta Districts. Minneapolis indicated a slowdown in activity   due to a general lack of snow this winter. Conversely, warm weather boosted   tourism in Richmond. Bookings were strong in New York, and occupancy rates   improved in the Boston, New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts. In   Boston and Kansas City, business travel continues to be the main driver of   tourism activity. Contacts in Boston and Atlanta expressed concern over high   fuel prices as a possible drag on leisure spending.
Non-residential construction activity improved in the Philadelphia,   Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts, though many of   these contacts characterized the improvement as slow. Boston, New York, and San   Francisco characterized non-residential real estate activity as unchanged or   steady. The energy and high-tech sectors were driving much of the demand in the   Dallas District. San Francisco noted a rise in the demand for office space from   the technology sector. Cleveland and Chicago saw a boost in healthcare-related   construction. Projects related to the education sector are showing growth in   Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Richmond. The outlook of builders is   described as positive or slowly improving in the Philadelphia, Cleveland,   Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts, and as cautiously optimistic in Boston.
Activity in natural resources remained strong. The Kansas City, Dallas, and   San Francisco Districts reported a shift from natural gas to oil exploration and   production due to low natural gas prices and growing demand for oil. In the   Cleveland District, leasing activity in the Utica shale is expanding. Cleveland   and St. Louis noted that the production of coal has slowed over the past few   months. The mining sector is expanding in San Francisco due to high prices for a   variety of precious metals, and iron ore mines in the Minneapolis District   continued to operate near capacity. Contacts in Kansas City reported a shortage   of engineers and experienced technical support for oil and gas drilling.
Wage pressures were characterized as contained or modest among reporting   Districts. Contacts in Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco noted some upward   pressure on wages for skilled jobs, especially in manufacturing and information   technology. In the Minneapolis District, strong oil-drilling and production   activity continued to bid up pay. Transportation contacts in Cleveland noted   some wage pressure due to a tightening of the driver pool. And medical benefits   continue to put pressure on labor costs in Philadelphia.
Overall price inflation was modest in most Districts. However, contacts in   the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts   cited rising transportation costs due to higher fuel prices. Minneapolis and   Dallas noted that airlines have raised their fares to offset higher fuel costs.   Richmond reported that rising fuel costs were a serious problem for both land   and ocean shippers, while intermodal transportation firms in Dallas said that   they had increased prices in response to higher fuel costs. In Atlanta, higher   transportation costs were passed through to consumers without much difficulty.   In contrast, contacts in Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco said it was   difficult to pass through higher costs to consumers. Input costs for   manufacturers in Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas City rose somewhat, but with   little pass-through. Price pressures have eased somewhat for manufacturing firms   in Philadelphia. Higher prices for construction materials narrowed profit   margins for contractors in Kansas City.
