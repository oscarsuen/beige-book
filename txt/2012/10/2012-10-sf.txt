Demand for steel was mostly stable, albeit at low levels, while sales of processed scrap metal fell further, largely as a result of sustained weak demand abroad.

Agriculture and Resource-related Industries Agricultural activity was mostly stable, and extraction activity of natural resources used for energy production continued to expand.
