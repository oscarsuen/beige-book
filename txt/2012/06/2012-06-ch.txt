Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand at a moderate pace   in April and May, although at a touch slower rate than during the prior   reporting period. Many contacts remained cautiously optimistic in their outlook   for the U.S. economy. Several, however, also noted an increase in economic   uncertainty, pointing to weaker business conditions in Europe and Asia and the   upcoming elections in the U.S. Growth in consumer spending slowed, while   business spending continued to increase at a steady pace. Manufacturing   production also rose at a steady pace, and construction activity increased as   well. Credit conditions were little changed on balance. Commodity prices moved   lower, and wage increases remained moderate. Planting of corn and soybeans was   well ahead of the normal pace and that of a year ago. Consumer Spending Consumer spending increased at a slower   rate in April and May. Retailers indicated that the slower sales pace was due in   large part to the unseasonable weather that had boosted activity during the   prior reporting period. Spending on necessities increased, while outlays for   big-ticket items like furniture, appliances, and electronics decreased.   Inventories generally were at more seasonally appropriate levels. Looking ahead,   some retailers are planning to add to inventories in expectation of a better   back-to-school season than last year. Auto sales were flat, and auto dealers   expect that sales will remain at about this pace through the fall. Some dealers   continued to report difficulty in stocking popular models because of supply   chain constraints. Business Spending Business spending continued at a steady   pace in April and May. Inventories generally were reported to be at comfortable   levels. Strong expected sales growth, high rates of capacity utilization, and   the need to replace aging equipment continued to support manufacturers'   expenditures on plant and equipment. Outside of manufacturing, firms were more   cautious in their capital spending, citing increased economic uncertainty. Labor   market conditions were little changed over the reporting period. Hiring remained   selective, and most contacts indicated that they had not changed their hiring   plans. Some manufacturers were increasing overtime, but noted that orders were   not yet strong enough to necessitate adding to their labor forces. Those   manufacturers who were looking to hire continued to report difficulty in finding   skilled workers. Several said they were easing job requirements, using   internships, or increasing college recruiting to try to fill open positions. Construction and Real estate Construction and real estate   activity increased in April and May. Demand continued to be strong for   multi-family construction, especially apartments, but also increased for   single-family homes. The residential rental market strengthened, with rents   rising further and one contact noting a shortage of single-family properties for   lease in parts of the District. Realtors indicated that they were also beginning   to see a pickup in demand in the for-purchase market for single-family homes, as   more sales had multiple offers on them. Commercial real estate conditions also   continued to improve gradually. Demand increased for urban office space, hotels,   and education facilities, while it remained weak for suburban office and retail   space. Vacancy rates edged lower, but remained elevated, particularly for retail   properties. A contact noted, however, that some suburban retail space was being   switched over to alternative uses. Manufacturing Manufacturing production increased at a   steady pace in April and May. Capacity utilization in the steel industry reached   its highest level since the end of the recession, as stronger demand from North   American customers offset weaker demand from Europe and Asia. The auto industry   remained a source of strength for manufacturing. Auto suppliers were operating   at high levels of capacity utilization, but noted that production growth had   stabilized after the large gains earlier in the year. Demand for heavy   equipment, though still strong, decreased slightly. Contacts expressed some   concern over current weakness in global demand, but indicated that the industry   was still being boosted by domestic demand, notably by a robust rental market   and continued strength in the energy and mining sectors. Agricultural and   construction equipment were also noted as areas of strength, with dealers adding   products for the upcoming construction season. Manufacturers of household goods   and building materials continued to experience soft demand, although a few noted   a recent pick-up in activity. Banking and Finance Credit conditions were little changed   on balance from the prior reporting period. Credit spreads and market volatility   edged up. Business loan demand remained limited apart from steady growth in   refinancing and capital replacement. For large banks, some of the weakness in   the business loan segment has been offset by an increase in demand for other   services, such as foreign exchange hedging and liquidity management. Banking   contacts indicated that there continues to be fierce competition among lenders   for creditworthy borrowers. Contacts also noted an increase in the availability   of credit for commercial real estate and consumer auto loans, while lending   standards for residential mortgages remained tight. Prices and Costs Cost pressures leveled off in April and   May. Steel prices softened, with one contact noting that weaker demand in Europe   and Asia had contributed to the decline. Energy prices also moved lower.   Wholesale price pressures eased some, most notably for cotton and dairy   products, although transportation costs continued to increase. Retailers   indicated that they were largely absorbing the higher transportation costs in   their margins and continued to discount heavily items such as clothing. Wage   pressures continued to be moderate, although many contacts noted an increase in   healthcare costs. Agriculture District corn and soybean planting in April   and May were well ahead of last year's pace, as well as the five-year average.   Corn planting was almost finished in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa. The emergence   of corn and soybean plants generally was also faster than typical. With an early   and promising start, the corn crop may set a record this year, although dryness   currently exists across much of the District. Corn and soybean prices fell   during the reporting period, while wheat prices rose. Milk prices decreased, and   prices are low enough to trigger some concerns about margins for dairy   operations. Hog and cattle prices were higher.
