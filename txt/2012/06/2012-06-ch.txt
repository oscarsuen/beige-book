Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand at a moderate pace   in April and May, although at a touch slower rate than during the prior   reporting period. Many contacts remained cautiously optimistic in their outlook   for the U.S. economy. Several, however, also noted an increase in economic   uncertainty, pointing to weaker business conditions in Europe and Asia and the   upcoming elections in the U.S. Growth in consumer spending slowed, while   business spending continued to increase at a steady pace. Manufacturing   production also rose at a steady pace, and construction activity increased as   well. Credit conditions were little changed on balance. Commodity prices moved   lower, and wage increases remained moderate. Planting of corn and soybeans was   well ahead of the normal pace and that of a year ago.
