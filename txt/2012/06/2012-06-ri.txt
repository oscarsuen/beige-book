Economic activity in the Fifth District improved modestly since our last   assessment. Retail sales were sluggish, held back in part by weak big-ticket   sales. Growth at services firms slowed, although tourism businesses reported   strong demand. Bankers said that lending grew slowly, and much of the activity   was refinancing. Residential real estate agents noted encouraging signs of   improvement in housing sales, while commercial Realtors described leasing and   construction activity as mostly flat to moderately up. Manufacturing reports   were mixed, with auto and other transportation equipment-related producers   continuing to do well, while other producers faced unchanged or weakening   demand. District hiring activity varied, with some businesses reluctant to hire   or unable to find qualified workers. Recent rainfall aided newly planted fields,   but excess moisture in some areas delayed planting. Price increases--both paid   and received--generally slowed.
Commercial real estate leasing and construction was flat or moderately   improving in recent months, although pockets of weakness persisted. Respondents   around the District reported more construction and absorption, especially in the   industrial segment. Contacts at several engineering and architectural firms   confirmed that interest in new construction projects increased, although demand   remained well below pre-recession levels. Construction activity in South   Carolina was driven by the recent expansion of manufacturing activity in the   state, while gains in West Virginia were associated with the emerging boom in   natural gas. One real estate developer in Charleston, South Carolina said that   rents had increased to the point where "new construction is starting to make   sense." A developer in the Richmond area cited a rise in demand for warehousing   space, related to healthcare facilities and an increase in on-line shopping   activity.
