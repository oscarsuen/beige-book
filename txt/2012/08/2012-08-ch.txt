Economic activity in the Seventh District expanded at a moderate pace in July   and early August, with the pace of growth once again slowing from the prior   reporting period. Contacts reported heightened concern regarding the risks to   the economic outlook, notably the U.S. fiscal situation and weaker growth in   Europe and Asia. Business spending increased at a slower pace, while consumer   spending growth picked up some. Growth in manufacturing production moderated   further, while construction activity continued to slowly increase. Credit   conditions were again slightly improved. Smaller anticipated corn and soybean   harvests due to the ongoing drought pushed crop prices higher and raised the   cost of feeding livestock, with some pass-through to wholesale prices already   taking place.
