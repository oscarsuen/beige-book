The Ninth District economy grew at a modest pace since the last report.   Increased activity was noted in consumer spending, tourism, professional   services, construction and real estate, while activity slowed slightly in the   manufacturing and energy sectors. Agriculture was mixed, while mining was steady   at high levels. Overall labor market conditions were steady since the last   report, and wage increases were modest. Prices were relatively stable. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending grew   since the last report. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer increased   3 percent in July compared with a year ago; a company representative noted that   back-to-school shopping activity has been positive. July same-store sales at a   Montana mall increased slightly compared with a year ago. Recent same-store   sales at a Minnesota-based restaurant chain were up about 7 percent compared   with a year ago. New car and light truck registrations in Minnesota were more   than 10 percent higher recently compared with last year. However, a higher-end   retailer announced plans to close a Minnesota store next year. Summer tourism activity increased from last year. Fishing license sales and   visits to campgrounds and outdoor state parks and recreation areas in South   Dakota were on a record pace. A resort in northwestern Wisconsin reported solid   bookings. Tourism activity in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was up 10 percent   to 20 percent. Visits to Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park   increased 20 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Activity at several other   Montana tourism attractions was also tracking ahead of last year. Meanwhile,   strong attendance levels were reported at the North Dakota State Fair in late   July. Construction and Real Estate Commercial construction   activity increased since the last report. The value of commercial building   permits in the Billings, Mont., area in July more than doubled from the same   period last year. Commercial permits in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area more than   doubled in value in July from a year earlier. New industrial and warehouse   building projects were in progress in the Minneapolis area. Residential   construction increased from a year ago. The value of residential building   permits in the Sioux Falls area in July was up 39 percent from the same period   last year. Residential permits increased in value and number in the   Minneapolis-St. Paul area in July; both single-family and multifamily permits   increased. Several counties in Montana reported large increases in home building   in 2012 compared with 2011, and the value of residential permits issued in July   more than doubled in Billings. Commercial real estate markets continued to expand. Vacancy rates for   Minneapolis office and industrial properties declined over the past year and   were expected to decline further, according to a real estate consulting firm.   Several large transactions were announced since the last report. Residential   real estate market activity was brisk. Home sales in early August were up 20   percent from the same period a year ago in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area; the   inventory of homes for sale was down 30 percent. In the Sioux Falls area, July   home sales were up 29 percent, inventory was down 14 percent and the median   sales price rose 6 percent relative to a year earlier. Services Activity at professional business services firms   grew somewhat since the last report. According to a mid-August Minneapolis Fed   ad hoc survey, District professional business services firms noted gains in   revenue and profits over the past three months and expect this to continue over   the next three months. Manufacturing Manufacturing activity slowed.   Surprisingly, a July survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University   (Omaha, Neb.) showed a decrease in manufacturing activity in Minnesota and South   Dakota for the first time in three years; activity in North Dakota increased,   but at a slower pace than in recent months. However, most respondents to a   Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey of manufacturers conducted in mid-August had a   mildly optimistic outlook for the near term. Several contacts indicated that   orders dropped in early July, but have returned to previous levels. A   long-planned beef-packing plant in South Dakota was put on hold following   reports that it would open soon. A Minnesota manufacturer that makes equipment   for the scrap metal industry will reduce production due to a stagnant scrap   metal market and a glut of new steel. Energy and Mining The energy sector moderated somewhat.   Oil and gas exploration in North Dakota decreased in early August, while it   increased slightly in Montana; production remained at record levels. Producers   of wind-energy components reported slow demand attributed to uncertainty over   the renewal of a tax credit. A Minnesota ethanol plant was idled because of high   corn input costs. A coal-fired power plant in South Dakota was also shut down.   Mining activity remained steady at high levels. Minnesota iron ore mines and   taconite producers continued to operate at high capacity, although some   operations were idled for standard annual maintenance. Sand mines in western   Wisconsin remained very busy due to strong demand from oil and gas producers. Agriculture The agriculture sector was mixed. Preliminary   results from the Minneapolis Fed's second-quarter (July) survey of agricultural   credit conditions showed that nearly 90 percent of lenders said farm incomes   increased or stayed the same in the past three months, with similar results for   household and capital spending. While severe drought hit the Midwest, much of   the District has been spared relative to other areas. Most of the corn, soybean   and spring wheat crops in Minnesota and North Dakota were in good or excellent   condition. South Dakota and Wisconsin fared somewhat worse. District cattle   producers have been selling more animals because of high feed costs. Margins   also tightened for dairy producers. Prices received by farmers in July increased   from a year earlier for corn, wheat, soybeans, hay, dry beans, poultry, eggs,   cattle and hogs; prices decreased for potatoes and dairy products. Employment, Wages, and Prices Overall labor market   conditions were steady since the last report, but tightening continued for some   regions and occupations. Bank directors noted that many District companies have   not adjusted their hiring plans for the second half of 2012. Manufacturers   throughout the District continued to have a number of welding positions open. A   business process outsourcing firm recently announced plans to locate up to 400   jobs in Minnesota. A Minnesota manufacturer hired 250 workers over the past   seven months. In contrast, a Minnesota food retailer plans to lay off 50   workers, and two North Dakota manufacturers are holding back on hiring plans. Wage increases were modest, with some exceptions. Wage rates in the   oil-drilling area of western North Dakota and eastern Montana continued to   climb. A Minnesota manufacturer noted that workers with higher skills were   getting some increases in wages, while wages for lower-skilled workers were   flat. Prices were relatively stable. Metals prices were down somewhat since the   last report. However, mid-August Minnesota gasoline prices were up about 30   cents per gallon from early July.
