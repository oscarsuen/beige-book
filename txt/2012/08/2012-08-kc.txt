The Tenth District economy continued to expand at a moderate pace in July and   early August. Retailers and auto dealers reported higher sales and expected   increased activity in the months ahead. Manufacturing activity expanded   slightly, with additional gains expected over the next six months.   Transportation activity grew moderately, while sales in the high-tech services   sector declined slightly. Residential and commercial real estate markets   continued to improve with increased sales, construction, and prices. Banking   contacts reported slightly higher loan demand and improved loan quality.   Agricultural conditions deteriorated under extreme drought conditions leading to   higher crop prices and strained profit margins for livestock producers. The   energy sector held steady as growth in crude oil drilling continued to offset   the decrease in drilling for natural gas. Most sectors reported higher input   prices, but final goods prices and wage pressures remained stable.
