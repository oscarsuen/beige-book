Aggregate business activity in the Third District has continued to grow slowly   since the previous Beige Book, although the pace of growth has shifted in a few   sectors. Manufacturing activity declined further, but the rate of decline is   tempering. Retail sales have grown somewhat faster than was the case at the time   of the last Beige Book, while auto sales have continued to increase at a   consistent pace. Lending volumes at Third District banks have continued to grow   steadily, and credit quality has continued to improve since the last Beige Book.   Demand for new home construction grew at a slightly faster pace than during the   previous Beige Book period, and brokers report steady growth in sales of   existing homes. Commercial real estate contacts report more widespread growth,   but overall demand remains modest. On average, service-sector firms report more   flattening of growth. Price pressures have changed little in most sectors since   the last Beige Book.
The overall outlook appears slightly less optimistic relative to the views   expressed in the last Beige Book, as contacts expressed uncertainty about the   presidential election and the fiscal policy decisions to follow. Expectations   among manufacturers, while still positive, have fallen further for overall   activity, anticipated hiring, and capital spending plans over the next six   months. Retailers, auto dealers, financial firms, and other service-sector firms   remain positive about the near-term outlook but are increasingly cautious due to   their customers' rising uncertainty. Real estate firms remain slightly more   optimistic with broader participation.
Since the last Beige Book, Third District   manufacturers have continued to report overall declines in shipments and new   orders; however, the weak demand was less widespread. Makers of lumber and wood   products; stone, clay, and glass products; and fabricated metal products have   reported gains--some seasonal--since the last Beige Book. Lower activity was   reported by makers of food products, primary metals, industrial machinery,   electronic equipment, and instruments. Contacts report that many customers are   delaying purchases due to uncertainty stemming from the European crisis and   domestic fiscal policy.
Optimism among Third District manufacturers that business conditions will   improve or stay the same during the next six months remains widespread, though   slightly less pervasive than reported in the last Beige Book. Among the major   sectors cited above, contacts at firms in the food and lumber industries expect   some growth, while contacts at fabricated metals and industrial machinery firms   expect some decline. Other major sectors expect no significant change over the   next six months. Firms have slightly lowered their overall expectations of   future capital spending and future hiring since the last Beige Book. Contacts   mentioned ongoing demand for autos, power generation utilities, and Marcellus   shale gas as sources of growth and optimism.
Third District retailers reported a pickup in   year-over-year sales for July compared with June. In early August, a retail   outlet operator reported stronger sales but softer traffic counts. One contact   noted that Olympic viewership numbers were very strong and may have dampened   traffic. Another contact relayed the theory that the pervasive negative   political advertising will dampen sales until after the election by displacing   product ads and by creating a negative sales climate. According to some   contacts, children's clothing is typically the last retail category to   experience declining sales in a downturn. Sales of children's clothing did not   improve in July after a surprising year-over-year decline in June. Despite these   various headwinds, retail contacts remain cautiously optimistic.
Auto sales remained moderate in Pennsylvania in July as in June, while New   Jersey dealers tended to report a repeat of their strong June sales in July and   early August. Strong demand and lean inventories are helping to support dealer   profits despite weak demand for dealer services, parts, and repairs. The   longer-term outlook for sales remains positive. Contacts point out that the   average age of cars has risen to 11 years, generating strong pent-up demand.   However, dealers remain concerned that rising consumer uncertainty will dampen   sales for the second half of the year.
Contacts from the Third District's financial   sector have reported ongoing growth since the previous Beige Book. Larger   lenders reported loan growth in mortgages, personal loans, small business loans,   and C&I loans. Smaller lenders continue to report increases primarily as   gains in market share in various lending segments from other banks--large and   small. Several small lenders reported increased activity in mortgages and home   refinancings. Most contacts report that the financial health of households,   businesses, and financial institutions continues to improve. Although the   overall outlook among lenders was positive, there is an expectation of tempered   growth until after the election, and there are concerns about the impacts of the   fiscal decisions that will follow.
Residential builders   reported a modest increase in sales and a stronger increase in traffic--an   improvement since the last Beige Book--as they near the end of their primary   sales season. Large builders are shifting their portfolios toward more   multifamily products and more urban locations. Some small builders are shifting   into home renovation work. Residential brokers reported continued improvement in   the sales of existing homes through July. Inventory levels are also falling. As   the traditional sales season draws to a close, an anticipated surge of listings   from the shadow inventory is not expected until spring 2013, assuming existing   home sales remain relatively strong. Builders and brokers share a cautiously   optimistic outlook.
Overall, nonresidential real estate activity has continued to grow slowly   since the last Beige Book. As Center City Philadelphia attracts more apartments   and condos--new construction and conversions--the remaining supply of office and   retail space has tightened somewhat. Moreover, the increased population is   attracting the interest of outside retailers. Contacts also indicated some   increased interest in commercial properties in southern New Jersey. The overall   outlook for nonresidential real estate remains one of slow growth, but it has   solidified and broadened throughout the Third District since the last Beige   Book.
Third District service-sector firms have   reported little to no growth since the last Beige Book. Several contacts   reported that orders and activity have flattened out. Logistics firms and   carriers reported a relatively flat start to the traditional "freight season,"   which should have ramped up in June. One contact reported that reduced crop   yields from widespread drought-stricken areas have generated an excess supply of   drivers and trucks, which may have siphoned normal business from other firms.   Staffing firms report no net new orders. One large firm that had been extending   temp contracts has begun letting them expire. Hospitals report some growth,   which may reflect demand for elective procedures that were deferred during the   recession. Additional growth may reflect expansions that garner greater market   share. Advertising is a rare bright spot. Revenue from the Olympics and   election-year advertising has surpassed expectations, on top of a positive   underlying trend. Overall, service-sector firms' positive outlook for growth   over the next six months has been somewhat tempered.
Price levels changed little overall,   although gas prices have risen a little since the previous Beige Book. Cost   factors have risen slightly among manufacturing firms since the last Beige Book.   One manufacturer reported that the drought and heat conditions have contributed   to relatively lower diesel prices and to higher peak energy prices,   respectively. Homebuilders and retailers continue to report tight margins but   little additional escalation of the prices that they face. Contacts from all   sectors report little or no wage pressures, other than for medical benefits.   Many contacts report stabilized house prices for lower-cost homes. Now, some   contacts report that the prices of homes in a few affluent areas are beginning   to stabilize as well.
