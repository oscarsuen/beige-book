The Eleventh District economy continued to grow at a moderate pace, and   outlooks were more positive than in the last report. Manufacturers reported   increased activity. Demand for business services was solid, and activity in   transportation services rose modestly. Housing and commercial real estate   markets continued to improve. Overall building activity remained subdued, with   the major exception being robust multifamily construction activity. Contacts   said retail sales growth was tepid and automobile sales held steady. Financial   services respondents said overall loan demand edged up. Energy activity was   strong, and agricultural conditions improved. Employment levels were flat to up   slightly. Price and wage pressures were modest. Prices Contacts across most industries said prices held   steady. The exceptions were some producers of transportation equipment,   fabricated metals and food who noted slight increases in selling prices to   partially offset higher input costs. Airlines reported higher fares, and   shipping firms noted an increase in express package and freight delivery   rates. The price of WTI was near $100 per barrel during the reporting period.   Natural gas prices fell from $3 per thousand cubic feet in early January to near   $2.50 in mid-February. Gasoline prices rose by about 22 cents per gallon over   the past six weeks, and the price of diesel rose by 7 cents. Prices of   petrochemicals and plastics increased since the last report. Labor Market Employment levels were unchanged at most   responding firms but some contacts noted increases. Staffing firms continued to   report high levels of demand. Oil services and machinery firms continued hiring   at a rapid pace, and slight employment increases came from some auto dealers,   airlines, and transportation, food and high-tech manufacturers. Shortages of   skilled workers continued to be reported, particularly for the energy industry.   Wage pressures remained minimal, although upward pressure for certain positions   such as auto mechanics and software engineers was reported. Several firms said   annual cost-of-living adjustments took effect at the start of the year. Manufacturing Overall demand for construction-related   materials improved, and several contacts noted that orders were up from year-ago   levels. Mild winter weather, robust multifamily construction and booming oil   field activity provided a boost to some producers of lumber, stone, clay and   glass. Fabricated metals manufacturers noted a pick-up in growth since the last   report, in part due to government projects. Producers of primary metals reported   a broad-based increase in orders, and one contact said they were adding a new   manufacturing plant. Construction-related outlooks were more positive than in   the last report, and several contacts expect a slight rebound in activity this   year. High-tech manufacturers said orders edged up moderately since the last   report. Demand for semiconductors and other electronic products improved,   largely due to a pickup in demand for automobiles, mobile devices and cloud   computing. In addition, one respondent noted that retailers of electronic goods   had been paring down inventories in the second half of 2011 and that orders   picked up as retailers ended the inventory reduction. Most contacts expect a   gradual improvement in demand over the next three to six months. Emergency vehicle, automobile and aviation equipment manufacturers said   demand was flat to up since the last report, and expectations are for strong   sales growth this year. Food producers noted an uptick in orders from the prior   report, largely due to stronger consumer demand. Overall conditions in the paper   products sector were mostly unchanged. Petrochemicals producers reported several large planned and unplanned outages   at ethylene and polyethylene production facilities, which led to a sharp   increase in prices. Export demand for polyethylene and caustic soda continued to   trend up, while domestic PVC demand remained weak due to low levels of housing   construction and infrastructure projects. Refiners noted weak demand for   petroleum products nationally, although refineries on the Gulf Coast were seeing   slightly higher margins than some other parts of the country. Contacts noted   Gulf Coast refineries were investing heavily on repairs and maintenance during   the current spring turnaround season. Retail Sales Retailers said overall sales growth was   tepid during the reporting period, largely due to unseasonably warm weather.   However, sales of non-seasonal items like menswear and home furnishings remained   strong. Eleventh District sales trended roughly in-line with the nation over the   reporting period, according to three large retailers. Inventories were at   desired levels. Contacts noted that the retail environment had improved, and   expectations are for moderate sales growth this year. Automobile sales held steady from the prior report. The used car market   remained tight. Vehicle inventories were somewhat lighter than normal.   Expectations are for moderate increases in new car sales this year. Services Demand for business services was solid and   outlooks were generally more optimistic than in the last report. Staffing firms   continued to report high levels of demand, noting more direct hires than   temporary placements. Demand for skilled professionals, particularly IT workers   was strong, while orders from the banking sector and demand for clerical staff   declined. Legal firms reported steady demand, with an uptick in corporate   activity and continued strength in intellectual property, energy and real-estate   related services. Accounting firms reported strong seasonal demand for tax   related services. Reports from transportation service firms were positive. Air cargo volumes   rose, while container shipments were flat during the reporting period. Railroads   noted a broad-based increase in shipments, with particularly strong growth in   petroleum products, motor vehicles and equipment, nonmetallic minerals, crushed   stone, metals and metallic ores. Shipping service firms reported an increase in   small parcel shipments from the prior report. Airlines reported passenger demand improved over the past six weeks. Domestic   demand and travel to Latin America were solid, while travel to Mexico and the   Pacific was weak. Contacts said business travelers remained price sensitive and   were purchasing restricted discount fares. Responding firms expect passenger   demand to remain stable over the next three months. Construction and Real Estate Housing demand continued to   firm since the last report. Sales of existing homes increased moderately and new   home sales were flat to slightly up. Some contacts noted that in January, which   is usually a slow month, buyer interest and activity was strong due to favorable   weather and record low interest rates. In addition, a fast-declining inventory   of homes was reported. Respondents expect the positive trend in sales to   continue, and outlooks suggest a modest increase in new home construction in   2012. Apartment leasing activity remained strong since the last report, and   responding firms said Texas markets were outperforming the U.S. average.   Investor interest in sales and development of multifamily complexes continued to   increase. The pace of current multifamily construction was said to be catching   up with historical norms. Nonresidential real estate activity continued to pick up, although   construction remained at low levels. Contacts said recent reports on leasing for   office and industrial space suggest moderate gains, thanks to demand from the   energy and high tech sectors. Investment sales activity continued to improve, in   part, due to very attractive interest rates. Contacts were optimistic in their   outlooks. Financial Services Financial firms reported a modest   uptick in loan demand. National banks reported strength in middle-market and   large corporate lending activity, and several regional banks noted   energy-related activity was robust. Outlooks were generally more optimistic than   at year-end 2011. Contacts said loan pricing remained moderately aggressive,   loan quality continued to improve and problem loans were declining. Respondents   noted they were willing to make loans, and borrowers' financial positions were   reportedly better than last year. Energy Energy-related service firms reported very strong   demand over the past six weeks, despite a small dip in the rig count due to low   natural gas prices. A few gas-directed drilling firms have announced drilling   cuts, but respondents expect oil-directed activity to offset the losses. Oil   service firms expect strong orders, high investment activity and good overall   prospects in 2012. Agriculture Recent rainfall eased drought conditions in   several areas, particularly in the northeastern parts of the District. The rain   helped refill stock tanks and benefitted pasture conditions. Farmers were a   little more optimistic about spring planting. Demand for agricultural products   remained strong. Contacts said cattle prices climbed to record levels, largely   due to tight supplies. High commodity prices have helped agricultural producers'   margins, but elevated input costs have erased some of those gains.
