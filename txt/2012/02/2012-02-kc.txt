The Tenth District economy expanded moderately in January and early February.   Despite a seasonal decline, consumer spending was stronger than expected and   retailers anticipated rising sales in coming months. District manufacturing   activity rebounded with stronger expectations for production, hiring, and   capital spending. Residential and commercial real estate activity improved, and   District contacts were optimistic regarding spring sales and construction   activity. District banks reported steady loan demand and improved loan quality.   Agricultural growing conditions improved with recent precipitation, and farmland   values soared with high commodity prices. High crude oil prices fueled a rebound   in District drilling activity with further gains expected during the next three   months. More contacts reported passing higher raw materials prices through to   finished goods prices. Many District contacts planned to hire additional workers   during the next quarter.
