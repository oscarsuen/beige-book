Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to grow at a moderate   pace during the reporting period of January through mid-February. Price   increases for final goods and services were limited, and upward wage pressures   were minimal. Sales of retail items rose on balance, and demand improved   modestly for business and consumer services. District manufacturing was mixed   but appeared to expand overall. Demand grew further for agricultural producers   but was uneven for providers of energy resources. Activity in District housing   markets remained sluggish, and demand for nonresidential real estate stayed weak   overall. Financial institutions reported a small increase in overall loan   demand.
Upward wage pressures were quite modest, as high levels of unemployment and   limited demand for new workers kept a lid on compensation gains. However,   contacts continued to point to notable increases in the costs of employee   benefits, particularly in regard to defined benefit pension plans, although they   reported slight easing in upward pressures on health benefit costs. Consistent   with prior periods, upward wage pressures remained pronounced for workers with   specialized skills in the application of information technology in assorted   sectors.
Demand for business and consumer services rose a bit on net. Sales grew   further for providers of technology services to businesses and consumers.   Similarly, demand for professional services such as legal services and   accounting ticked up on balance. For providers of health-care services, demand   was largely stable, with declines in inpatient admissions and surgeries offset   by higher emergency room visits. Sales activity was reported to be largely   unchanged for restaurants and other food-service providers. Conditions in the   District's travel and tourism industry continued to strengthen, reflecting   growth in both the business and tourism segments of the market.
