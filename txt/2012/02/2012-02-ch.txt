Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand at a moderate   pace in January and early February. Growth in consumer spending slowed, but   business spending increased. Manufacturing production increased, and   construction, while still subdued, was also up. Credit conditions improved.   Price increases slowed, while wage increases remained moderate. Prices for corn,   soybeans, wheat, hogs, and cattle moved higher, while milk prices drifted   lower. Consumer Spending Growth in consumer spending slowed in   January and early February. Contacts indicated that activity was boosted by   clearance sales and noted an increase in consumers turning to discount   retailers. There was also some isolated improvement in the luxury segment, with   jewelers and high-end boutiques reporting higher sales. However, the mild winter   depressed sales of apparel and other weather-related items, and contacts noted   that many retailers were running heavy promotions on unsold winter merchandise   to make room for spring inventory. Auto sales were up in January, but down   slightly in early February reflecting in part a decline in incentives. Business Spending Business spending increased in January   and early February. Most retailers indicated their inventories were at   comfortable levels. However, a number of auto dealers continued to report lower   than desired levels for some models. Several manufacturers also noted that they   were tightly managing their input inventory levels to avoid being caught   off-guard were commodity prices to decline further or activity slow   substantially from the pace of the fourth quarter. Capital spending increased,   with reports of capacity expansions in manufacturing and renovations of existing   facilities in the retail sector. Labor market conditions improved, although   hiring remained selective. A staffing firm reported an increase in growth in   billable hours that was largely driven by gains in industrial and office   positions. Contacts indicated that many manufacturers were increasingly moving   away from contracting with temporary agencies to direct hiring, focusing on   higher skilled positions where attracting job candidates has remained difficult.   Long-term unemployment remained elevated. Labor market analysts reported that it   was becoming increasingly difficult for these workers to find a job, and several   contacts indicated that they were hesitant to hire individuals who had been out   of work for an extended period of time. Construction and Real Estate Construction activity was up   slightly in January and early February. Multi-family construction continued to   be an area of strength. In contrast, single-family construction remained weak,   and homebuilders indicated that it will likely continue to be until home prices   stabilize from their recent declines. Nonresidential construction continued to   trend up moderately, although a contact noted a decline in funding for new   public infrastructure. Demand for industrial facilities increased, especially in   the automotive sector as suppliers are expanding to meet the higher pace of   vehicle production. Commercial real estate conditions continued to improve with   vacancy rates edging lower from their elevated levels. The demand for office   space picked up and rents increased. In contrast, contacts continued to report   excess availability of retail space. Manufacturing After a strong close to 2011, manufacturing   production increased further in January and early February. Contacts in the   sector remained cautiously optimistic about 2012. Exporters continued to benefit   from advantageous terms of trade, and contacts noted an increase in interest by   foreign manufacturers in moving production to the U.S. as well as increasing   utilization of domestic suppliers. The auto industry continued to be a source of   strength. Contacts expected that auto sales in 2012 would hold near the pace   seen in January, which, while still below pre-recession levels, would mark   another year of recovery for the industry. Demand for heavy equipment also   remained strong, led by robust activity in the energy and mining sector. An   aging fleet of heavy trucks and machinery and tightening emission standards for   such equipment were noted as reasons for the likely continued strength in demand   in 2012. Manufacturers of specialty metals also reported solid order books and   robust quoting activity. Outside of these industries, however, activity was   again weaker. Manufacturers of household goods and building materials continued   to experience soft demand, although a few noted a small improvement since the   beginning of the year. Banking and Finance Credit conditions were slightly   improved from the previous reporting period. Financial market volatility   declined and risk premia moved lower across a number of asset classes.   Improvements in the availability of credit were noted for both subprime auto   lending and commercial real estate, particularly for large apartment buildings.   Banking contacts indicated that loan growth continued at a moderate pace with   demand from larger businesses being stronger than that from small to mid-sized   companies. Even though contacts thought the economic outlook was more positive,   they indicated that borrowers and investors remain cautious, citing uncertainty   about future tax code changes and risks abroad, in particular those emanating   from Europe. That said, concerns about Europe were reported to have become   milder in recent weeks. Prices and Costs Cost pressures were largely unchanged in   January and early February, but the volatility of commodity prices remained a   concern for many contacts. Natural gas prices remained at historic lows, while   prices increased for fuel and metals such as copper and brass. Raw materials   surcharges declined and lead times shortened with a few exceptions such as   carbide and some hydraulic products. Wholesale price changes were mixed by   category, but little changed on balance. Most of the cost increases were being   passed on to consumers, but retailers reported that, overall, pricing power   remained limited. Wage pressures continued to be moderate, with most contacts   indicating that wage increases were expected to keep pace with inflation.   Contacts continued to report a shortage of skilled manufacturing workers, and   noted that increased competition among firms had led to some upward pressure on   their wages. Agriculture Corn, soybean, wheat, hog, and cattle prices   rose during January and early February. Input costs for agriculture continued to   increase, led by sharply higher rental rates for cropland. The increases in   these costs have pressured farmers' margins. In order to offset the risks of   price declines or poor harvests, farmers have been willing to spend more on   revenue insurance policies. Estimates of corn stocks have come down and are   below where they were a year ago. Given current rates of use, the expected   supply of corn in stock just before the next harvest is around three weeks,   about as tight as last year. Cattle operations are working to build herd sizes,   even though bid prices for cattle are very high. Contacts expected farmers to   boost their capital expenditures in 2012 compared with 2011.
