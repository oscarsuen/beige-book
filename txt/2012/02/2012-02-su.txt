Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and   based on information collected on or before February 17, 2012. This document   summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the   Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve   officials.
Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that overall   economic activity continued to increase at a modest to moderate pace in January   and early February. Activity expanded at a moderate pace in the Cleveland,   Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. St. Louis noted a   modest pace of growth and Minneapolis characterized the pace of growth as firm.   Economic activity rose at a somewhat faster pace in the Philadelphia and Atlanta   Districts, while the New York District noted a somewhat slower pace of   expansion. The Boston and Richmond Districts, in turn, noted that economic   activity expanded or improved in most sectors. Manufacturing continued to expand at a steady pace across the nation, with   many Districts reporting increases in new orders, shipments, or production and   several Districts indicating gains in capital spending, especially in   auto-related industries. Activity in nonfinancial services industries remained   stable or increased. Reports of consumer spending were generally positive except   for sales of seasonal items, and the sales outlook for the near future was   mostly optimistic. Tourism remained strong in some reporting Districts, but   declined in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts because of reduced   snowfall. Residential real estate market conditions improved somewhat in most   Districts, with several reports of increased home sales and some reports of   increased construction. Commercial real estate markets also showed positive   results in some Districts. Banking conditions generally improved across the   Districts. Agricultural conditions were mixed, while extraction activity   generally increased. Hiring increased slightly across several Districts, and contacts in a variety   of industries faced difficulties finding skilled workers. Wage pressures were   generally contained, and prices of final goods remained stable, although   contacts in some Districts anticipate passing rising input prices through to   consumer prices. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Manufacturing   has continued to increase across all twelve Federal Reserve Districts since the   previous report. Most Districts reported gains in new orders, shipments, or   production. Contacts reported increased capital spending in the Boston,   Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts;   contacts in Philadelphia and Cleveland also anticipate higher capital spending.   Manufacturing contacts in San Francisco also continued to invest in information   technology equipment. Auto-related manufacturers in the Richmond, Atlanta, St.   Louis, and Minneapolis Districts reported increased activity and announced plans   to expand operations and open new plants. Primary metal manufacturing showed   strong growth in the Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts. Fabricated   metal manufacturing increased in the Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts   but was essentially flat in the San Francisco District. Steel producers reported   that shipping volume was trending higher in the Cleveland District and specialty   metal contacts reported solid order bookings in the Chicago District. In   contrast to the many positive reports, contacts in some Districts reported plans   to decrease operations and close plants. Contacts in chemical and paper product   manufacturing in the St. Louis District reported plans to close plants and lay   off workers, while manufacturers of household goods and building materials   reported soft demand on average in the Chicago District. Manufacturing contacts   in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland Districts expressed concern about the   risks posed by the situation in Europe. Nonfinancial services activity was stable or increased in the New York,   Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San   Francisco Districts. Transportation services were stable or trending higher in   the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts. In contrast, freight   transportation contacts in the St. Louis and Kansas City Districts reported that   business had slowed. Information technology service firms in the Boston, St.   Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts have experienced increased   demand since the previous reporting period. Additionally, contacts in health   care announced plans to increase capital spending or expand operations in the   Richmond and St. Louis Districts. Consumer Spending and Tourism Retail sales in the   Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts were   higher than year-earlier sales. The Boston District reported strong same-store   sales in the last few months of 2011, but mixed results for same-store sales in   January. Retail sales increased in the Richmond and San Francisco Districts, but   were mixed in the New York and Cleveland Districts and weakened in the Kansas   City District. Retail sales growth in the Dallas District was tepid and consumer   spending growth slowed in the Chicago District. The Boston, New York,   Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts noted that mild winter   weather had depressed sales of seasonal items. Mark-downs on winter merchandise   to clear inventory were reported in the Boston, Chicago, and Richmond Districts.   Aside from unsold seasonal items, inventories were more broadly reported to be   at satisfactory levels. All Districts reporting sales expectations for the   coming months indicated optimism among contacts that sales will improve. Gains in auto sales were reported in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis,   and Minneapolis Districts. Chicago also reported sales increases in January, but   noted that sales were down slightly in early February. Auto dealers in the New   York, Cleveland, and Richmond Districts reported a slowdown in recent auto   sales, while auto sales held steady in the Dallas District and contacts in the   Kansas City District reported a post-holiday lull in sales. All Districts   reporting on sales outlooks conveyed optimism. Dealers in the Kansas City   District expect demand for smaller, fuel-efficient cars to spur sales in coming   months, while contacts in the Cleveland District were optimistic but uncertain   that sales increases in 2011 could be repeated in 2012. Tourism strengthened or remained strong in the New York, Richmond, Atlanta,   and San Francisco Districts. The Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts reported   a decrease in tourism largely attributed to below-average snowfall. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate   activity increased modestly in most Districts. Boston, Cleveland, Richmond,   Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas reported growth in home sales, while New York   noted steady to slightly softer home sales. Philadelphia reported strong   residential real estate activity. In contrast, home sales declined in St. Louis   and San Francisco noted that home demand persisted at low levels. Contacts'   outlooks on home sales growth were mostly optimistic. Contacts in Boston,   Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Dallas expect home sales to rise further. Home prices   declined or held steady in many areas. Cleveland and Atlanta reported little   movement in house prices, while contacts in Boston, New York, Philadelphia,   Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City reported some declines. Single-family   residential construction was weak in Chicago and declined in St. Louis;   Cleveland noted that the year-end uptick seen in construction has abated   somewhat, and Minneapolis noted increased single-family building permits. In   contrast, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco   reported increased multifamily construction activity. Commercial real estate markets displayed positive results in some Districts,   as leasing showed overall improvement. Minneapolis, Richmond, Chicago, and   Dallas noted increased leasing. Boston, however, reported mostly unchanged   leasing fundamentals with some modest improvement since the previous report.   Commercial vacancy rates were mixed in New York, decreased in Chicago, increased   in St. Louis, and stayed high in San Francisco.

Lending was little changed in St. Louis and Kansas City, while loan demand was   described as weak in Richmond and soft at regional banks in Atlanta. Demand for   business credit was flat to slightly higher in Cleveland and increased slightly   in Richmond, San Francisco, and at some large banks in Atlanta.

Delinquencies were steady or declined in Cleveland. Mortgage delinquencies   were steady in the New York District but delinquencies decreased in other loan   categories. Agriculture and Natural Resource Industries Drought   conditions and warm temperatures affected agricultural conditions in some   Districts. However, recent rainfalls in parts of the Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas   City, and Dallas Districts helped ease the dry conditions. Crop yields for St.   Louis were mixed, with only winter wheat, rice, and tobacco showing positive   gains for 2011. Tobacco and cotton yields in Richmond were lower than historical   averages. San Francisco reported growth in orders and final sales for   agriculture products. Farm values and incomes were stronger in Minneapolis and   Kansas City, while Richmond saw a slight drop in farmland values. Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted higher crude oil extraction   activity. Similarly, Chicago and Minneapolis reported robust activity in energy   and mining, and energy-related service firms in Dallas reported very strong   demand. Mining for various metals also increased in the San Francisco District.   Cleveland reported flat conventional oil and natural gas drilling and   production, and San Francisco observed lower demand for natural gas. The Dallas   District noted drilling cuts by a few gas-directed firms, but contacts   anticipate that oil-directed activity will offset losses. Compared with a year   ago, current coal production is lower in St. Louis and higher in Kansas   City. Employment, Wages, and Prices Of the Districts reporting   on hiring, most indicated a slight increase. Boston, New York, Cleveland,   Richmond, St. Louis, and Minneapolis reported increased hiring in manufacturing,   and contacts in Philadelphia and Kansas City anticipate future hiring in the   sector. Several businesses in the Atlanta District also reported plans to   increase payrolls. Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas noted increased hiring   among auto dealers. Contacts in Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas   City, and Dallas were having difficulties finding skilled or specialized workers   in a variety of industries. In contrast, Boston manufacturing contacts reported   fewer complaints about being unable to find qualified workers. Chicago noted   that hiring remains selective and long-term unemployment elevated, while San   Francisco noted limited demand for new workers. Staffing firms in Boston noted   that the hiring cycle remains "elongated" despite stronger demand. Staffing   firms in Dallas also noted high demand, while a major employment agency in New   York indicated flat hiring. Among Districts commenting on wages, upward pressures appeared limited.   Boston noted limited pay rises in retail and manufacturing. Richmond reported   some upward wage pressures in the service sector and manufacturing. Dallas and   San Francisco reported minimal wage pressures, although upward pressure for   certain specialized positions was reported in both Districts. Similarly, wage   pressures remained largely subdued in Kansas City except for high-tech and   energy positions. Wage pressures were modest or largely contained in Cleveland   and Dallas, while Philadelphia noted flat wages and Minneapolis reported modest   wage increases. New York noted that Wall Street compensation remains under   downward pressure. Prices of final goods and services were relatively stable in most Districts.   Retail prices increased at a moderate pace in the Richmond and Kansas City   Districts. Contacts in the New York District reported modest increases in   selling prices and prices paid.
