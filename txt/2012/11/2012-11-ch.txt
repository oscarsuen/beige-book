Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand at a slow pace in   October and early November. Contacts noted heightened uncertainty over the   near-term economic outlook as the deadline for the fiscal cliff approaches, but   remained cautiously optimistic that growth would pick up to a moderate pace in   2013. By sector, gains in consumer spending were up slightly from the previous   reporting period, while growth in business spending moderated further.   Manufacturing production decelerated, while construction increased at a slow but   steady pace. Credit conditions continued to improve gradually. Cost pressures   were little changed, although food prices eased. Corn and soybean production in   the District did not suffer as much from the drought as previously had been   expected.
