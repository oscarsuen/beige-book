The Tenth District economy expanded modestly in October. Stronger retail sales   underpinned a rebound in consumer spending that was expected to continue during   the upcoming holidays. Commercial and residential construction remained solid,   and real estate agents expected real estate prices to rise further with stronger   sales. Bankers reported stronger commercial lending activity and additional   demand for residential real estate loans. District manufacturing activity   slowed, but factory managers expected a moderate rebound in orders, production,   and shipments. High feed and fuel costs drove agricultural loan demand higher,   and dry conditions hindered winter crop development. District contacts expected   natural gas drilling activity to strengthen seasonally with prices during the   winter heating months. The prices of raw materials for manufacturing and   construction rose, and some finished goods prices edged higher. Wage   pressures were subdued except for specialized positions at transportation,   high-tech and energy firms. Several business contacts commented that   uncertainty regarding political, economic, and tax policies was inhibiting   growth, limiting business investment, and delaying hiring plans. Consumer Spending Consumer spending rebounded modestly in   October and retailers expected further sales gains during the holidays. District   retailers reported that sales rose above year-ago levels, although they were   generally below expectations. Several store owners noted particularly strong   sales for major appliances and seasonal apparel, in addition to an uptick in   demand for premium and custom goods, such as fine jewelry. Auto sales held   steady after rising in the last survey period, and sales were expected to   improve by year's end. Fuel-efficient cars sold well, while demand for large,   expensive cars and trucks remained weak. Tourism contacts reported that visitor   counts and tourism spending fell below year-ago levels. Furthermore, hoteliers   reduced room rates and noted the fall in hotel occupancy rates was likely to   continue in coming months. Restaurant owners reported lower sales revenue and a   decline in average check amounts. Some leisure and hospitality contacts   attributed the slowdown in sales to high gas prices that limited spending and   kept some customers at home. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Although   manufacturing activity slowed slightly since the last survey period, sales at   transportation and high-tech service firms rebounded. While still above year-ago   levels, District manufacturing activity edged lower in October as production of   both durable and non-durable goods slowed, most notably at machinery,   electronics and food processing plants. In addition, order backlogs fell further   and were expected to remain low. The volume of new orders and shipments dropped   in October, but were expected to rebound and provide a modest boost to   production during the next six months. Capital spending at District factories   generally held steady; however, fewer plant managers were hiring and the average   work week declined. Trucking traffic picked up, due in part to emergency food   shipments to areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. Several transportation firms   reported an increase in capital spending and a shortage of qualified truck   drivers. After easing in the last survey period, business activity at high-tech   firms expanded and sales were expected to strengthen in the months ahead.   Several business contacts attributed customer delays in ordering to uncertainty   regarding the current political, economic and tax environment. Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate   activity remained brisk in October, and commercial real estate activity held   firm. A solid rise in home sales reduced home inventories further, with real   estate agents noting particular buyer interest in foreclosed properties. Low-   and mid-priced homes continued to sell well, while the market for luxury homes   and condominiums remained weak. Residential mortgage lenders saw loan   applications for home purchases rise above year-ago levels and saw an upswing in   loan refinancing activity. Stronger sales supported further home price increases   for both existing and new homes. Housing starts were up from the previous   survey, but were expected to level off with a seasonal slowdown in construction   over the winter months. Sales at construction supply firms rebounded,   particularly for lumber products. Commercial real estate markets remained   stronger than a year ago and District contacts expected additional strength in   coming months. New commercial construction edged up and was expected to hold   steady. Commercial sales activity and real estate prices remained above year-ago   levels with strong expectations through the end of the year. District contacts   expected commercial real estate rents to rise as vacancy rates trended lower.   Developers, however, were concerned about the size of down payments and reported   a slight deterioration in access to credit. Banking In the recent survey period, some District   bankers reported stronger loan demand, improvements in loan quality and a slight   rise in deposit levels. Total loan demand rose moderately, led by gains in   demand for real estate loans for both residential and commercial properties. In   addition, more bankers reported higher loan demand and lower interest rates for   commercial and industrial loans. A few bankers noted continued weakness in   consumer installment loan demand. Many bankers reported a moderate improvement   in loan quality compared with the last survey with additional quality   improvements expected during the next six months. Otherwise, credit standards   remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories. Agriculture High input costs reduced farm profitability   and boosted farm loan demand since the last survey period. Demand for farm   operating loans rose as surging feed costs cut livestock operator incomes and   crop producers paid higher fuel costs to run irrigation and harvest equipment.   With reduced incomes, especially for livestock producers, farm loan renewals and   extensions edged up and loan repayment rates eased from recent peaks. Still,   bankers reported that sufficient funds were available to meet short-term   financing needs. Low soil-moisture levels hindered winter wheat emergence,   raising concerns that persistent drought could strain U.S. crop production, keep   crop and feed prices high, and force further livestock herd liquidations.   Farmland values, however, continued to set new record highs in the District. Energy District energy activity fell in October, but was   expected to improve heading into the winter heating season. The number of active   oil rigs in the District eased from recent highs as oil prices declined. After   falling from summer peaks, the number of natural gas rigs held steady since the   last survey and some District contacts expected a seasonal uptick in natural gas   prices as winter approached. Wyoming's coal production remained well below   year-ago levels as more electricity was being generated from natural gas.   District ethanol production edged up, but persistently high corn prices limited   profits. Wages and Prices Wage pressures remained subdued during   the survey period, raw materials prices rose, and some finished goods prices   edged up. Many firms were reluctant to increase wages or hire staff amid   political and economic uncertainty. Some businesses, however, were offering   higher salaries to recruit workers with specialized skills, such as engineers,   software developers, and commercial truck drivers. The cost of raw materials for   manufacturing continued to climb, and a few firms were raising finished goods   prices. Builders and construction supply companies expected further price   increases for construction materials due to Hurricane Sandy. Retail prices edged   up but were expected to hold steady during the holiday shopping season.   Restaurant owners, however, planned to increase menu prices due to high food   costs. Low occupancy rates prompted hotel operators to reduce average room   rates.
