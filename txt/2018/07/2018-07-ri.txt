Trucking firms continued to see strong growth and record-setting months. A Virginia freight hauler increased its fleet while other companies around the District said they would expand more if they could hire more drivers. Meanwhile, a North Carolina company built new distribution centers to increase capacity. As trucking firms again struggled to meet demand, they were able to increase rates. Demand remained strong for nearly every type of cargo, although a company in North Carolina reported particularly strong growth in retail goods.
District retailers experienced strong sales in recent weeks. A Virginia auto dealer reported a noticeable uptick in business, and a North Carolina auto dealer attributed high sales growth to manufacturer incentives. A Maryland hardware store saw growing business, even as competition increased, and worked to improve its online presence with more sophisticated pricing technology. A West Virginia material handling equipment retailer reported that strong demand for goods was leading to shrinking inventory, a concern echoed by retailers around the District. Retailers also expressed concerns over trucking shortages, which are causing long lead times and higher shipping expenses.
Commercial real estate leasing and sales rose modestly in recent weeks. District brokers reported increased demand for industrial space and a pickup in restaurant leasing, while retail activity slowed slightly. New commercial office construction was soft, despite reports of some build-to-suit projects. Agents said that office and retail landlords were offering fewer incentives and concessions had tightened. Vacancy rates remained low across sub-markets, and a few brokers noted a lack of available product. Commercial rental rates were generally reportedly as stable to increasing modestly. Multifamily leasing remained healthy, overall.
