Staffing firms reported ongoing demand for workers, but a scarcity of candidates, plus difficulty hiring and retaining employees. As the job market tightens, wages have risen, and employers have converted more full-time temporary workers to permanent employees than is normal. However, according to one contact, many temp orders continued to be for part-time work.
On balance, wage growth appears to have accelerated to a moderate pace and was more widespread. Over half of the nonmanufacturing contacts reported increases in wage and benefit costs. Several banking contacts also noted rising wages, especially for lower-wage jobs.
One service firm noted that it had been slowly raising wages and was now starting to push prices up to meet the added expense. However, one homebuilder reported no ability to raise prices despite facing rising costs for many building materials.
Looking ahead six months, manufacturing firms continued to anticipate higher prices, with two-thirds expecting increases in prices paid and over half expecting increases in prices received for their own goods.
The makers of chemical products, paper products, fabricated metal products, and electronic equipment tended to note gains in new orders and shipments; the makers of lumber products, primary metals, and industrial machinery reported mixed results. One machinery manufacturer noted that the effects of the steel tariffs have been chaotic to its supply chain--disrupting planned orders, increasing prices, and prompting some panic buying.
On balance, manufacturing contacts continued to expect general activity to increase over the next six months; the percentage of firms expecting future increases remained just below 50 percent. About 40 percent of the firms expected increases in future employment and future capital expenditures, which represented an improved outlook for capital expenditures since the prior period, but a lower expectation for employment.
Auto dealers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania reported year-over-year sales that were flat to up slightly in May and June. Year-to-date sales appear to be holding even with 2017's high levels. However, dealers noted greater downside risk than normal for the second half of this year, including disruptions from tariffs, volatile markets, and rising interest rates.
Tourism contacts continued to report modest growth overall. As temperatures climbed past 100 degrees in Philadelphia, expectations rose that more city residents would escape to the shore and the mountains in July and August. Atlantic City's casino revenues fell on a year-over-year basis in May, yet two large casinos reopened in late June.
During the current period, credit card lending grew at a moderate pace--slow by comparison to the same period last year for this highly seasonal measure. Over the year, credit card lending has grown modestly.
Banking contacts continued to note competitive pressure to raise deposit rates but flagged few concerns about credit standards and no issues with credit quality. Bankers remained generally confident about future economic prospects.
Overall, nonresidential real estate contacts reported no change in the modest growth in leasing activity. However, as several major projects reach or near completion in Philadelphia, there has been a slow and steady decline in labor hours from previously high levels of construction activity.
