Auto demand and vehicle financing conditions held steady. One auto dealer noted that leasing activity had weakened as manufacturers reduced their support. All contacts reported that sales of passenger vehicles lagged those of crossovers, SUVs, and trucks. One contact speculated that the market share for such vehicles would increase because of increased vehicle fuel economy, older customers' need for comfort, and a younger generation of customers starting families. Expectations for vehicle sales in the near-term were mixed. One dealer was concerned that price increases and higher interest rates could sap demand. Another dealer was optimistic that activity in the energy industry could lift sales in the region.
Nonresidential builders noted that the strong demand of recent periods continued in the current period and that backlogs ticked higher as firms struggled with labor constraints. Capital investment plans were mostly unchanged, although one commercial builder stated that the firm boosted spending to use drones for surveying to make up for the shortage of workers. Most contacts expected the current momentum in customer demand to continue in the near term. However, there was some concern that demand from industrial clients could weaken depending on the course taken by trade disputes.
