The number of active oil rigs increased modestly, and the number of active gas rigs remained unchanged. Most firms reported continued strong capital spending plans, although several businesses expressed concern about pipeline capacity. Despite persistent growth in global oil demand, contacts projected slightly lower oil prices which a number of firms attributed to the announcement of OPEC's production increases. Expectations for natural gas prices improved further. Agriculture The Tenth District farm economy weakened slightly, and drought persisted in some regions. Trade uncertainty and expectations of larger supplies in 2018 put downward pressure on crop prices. Corn prices were slightly lower than a year ago following a sharp decline in June, while soybean prices declined even more rapidly and reached an eight-year low. Although prices for wheat remained steady and slightly higher than a year ago, revenues in Kansas and Oklahoma could remain strained as nearly half of winter wheat acreage was rated as poor or very poor due to dry conditions. Livestock prices were slightly lower than one year ago following modest declines in June. Hog prices, which continued to be supported by expectations of increased U.S. exports and relatively strong global demand, increased slightly in June but remained slightly below levels from one year ago.
