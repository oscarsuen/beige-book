On balance, wage growth held steady at a modest pace, although the percentage of nonmanufacturing firms reporting increases slipped below 40 percent. One manufacturing firm noted that significant annual increases in health-care costs precluded the firm's ability to offer wage increases; several other firms cited difficulties with rising benefit costs. A few contacts commented on the recent news that numerous large firms had announced plans to offer bonuses this year and/or to raise their minimum wage rates.
In one of the District's tighter labor markets, a staffing firm reported that wages had risen 4 percent over the year, while various firms from that same market noted that they were very busy, but the lack of qualified labor was constraining their growth. In the Poconos, the tight labor market was impacting firms' ability to fill low-skilled jobs and middle management positions.
Retailers and banking contacts reported few signs of inflationary pressure, and builders noted little change to the typical price increases for construction materials. Overall, existing home prices continued to rise, with some variation across markets and price categories.
The makers of paper products, chemicals, primary metal products, industrial machinery, and electronic equipment continued to note gains in new orders and shipments; firms in the lumber and fabricated metal sectors reported declines in activity.
A majority of manufacturing contacts continued to expect general activity to increase over the next six months. The percentage of firms expecting future increases for general activity rose above 60 percent. By comparison, the percentage of firms expecting increases in future capital expenditures and future employment held mostly steady at levels just above 40 percent. However, a somewhat higher percentage of firms expected decreases in future employment compared with the prior period.
Auto dealers reported modest declines overall in year-over-year sales this period, a further deterioration from slight decreases during the prior period. Nevertheless, sales remain at high levels. While early reports from Pennsylvania dealers suggested a slight increase, later reports from New Jersey dealers noted that the cold weather dampened sales, which are normally very strong in late December due to year-end bonuses. However, this year dealers felt that "people with cash on hand ran to the municipal tax office to prepay property taxes, not buy cars."
Tourism contacts continued to report modest growth overall. A Poconos contact reported that ski resorts were sold out on weekends and that visitors exhibited confidence by extending their stays and keeping restaurants busy. In November, Atlantic City's casino revenues continued to grow modestly relative to the prior year. However, the January 4 bomb cyclone limited activity over this period's final weekend as shore areas dug out from heavy snows and skiers in mountain resorts were greeted by single-digit temperatures.
The significant seasonal increase in credit card volumes anticipated for the recent holiday period did occur and was comparable in size to the increase during the same period last year.
Banking contacts described solid ongoing economic growth in most parts of the District. Several noted that previously hot sectors, including commercial real estate and multifamily housing, appear to have plateaued or cooled off a bit. Credit quality was portrayed as very good; one contact reported telling bank staff to "take a picture," as the bank's loan portfolio was so sound.
On balance, brokers in Third District housing markets continued to report slight growth of existing home sales. In most local markets, exceedingly low inventories of houses constrain sales and place upward pressure on house prices.
Nonresidential real estate contacts reported no significant changes in the high levels of overall construction activity. Commercial contractors focused on Philadelphia noted that 2017 was a strong year and that activity should continue through 2018. New project announcements are needed to extend current activity levels into 2019. Rising lease rates and new construction of industrial/warehouse space continued to be noted in many Third District markets. Essentially, little change was noted in the level of leasing activity, although markets vary significantly by sector and geography.
