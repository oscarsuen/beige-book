On balance, contacts noted steady but modest wage growth; however, compensation negotiations were more prevalent among highly-skilled/specialized workers.
Holiday reports from District travel and hospitality contacts indicated much higher-than-anticipated tourism activity. Further, the outlook among contacts remains positive for the first quarter of 2018 with strong advance bookings in the conference and business travel segments.
Many commercial real estate contacts from the District reported improvements in demand that resulted in rent growth, specifically in industrial and warehouse/distribution properties and to a lesser degree in office and multifamily. Contacts cautioned that the rate of improvement varies by metropolitan area, submarket, and property type. The majority of commercial contractors indicated that the pace of nonresidential construction activity had increased from one year ago. Most contacts continued to report a healthy pipeline of activity, with the majority indicating backlogs greater than or similar to the previous year's level. While the majority of reports indicated that the pace of multifamily construction matched or exceeded the year-ago level, a growing share continued to report that activity was down from one year earlier. Commercial construction contacts' outlook for nonresidential and multifamily construction activity improved across the District since the last report.
