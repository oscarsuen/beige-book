Trucking remained strong in recent weeks as companies struggled to meet the high demand with a shortage of drivers. A Virginia trucking company said they were investing in better equipment in an effort to recruit drivers. Meanwhile, a North Carolina trucking company reported quadrupling rates for high-risk customers in order to ease demand but found that some customers were willing to pay the new rates. Higher shipping rates allowed trucking companies to increase profits despite rising labor costs. Many shippers had to turn to rail as trucking firms turned them away. A Virginia rail company reported seeing record profits so far this year but also struggled to keep up with demand.
Travel and tourism activity remained strong, overall, in recent weeks despite some adverse weather conditions. For example, a Virginia resort reported strong bookings despite the weather but low participation in outdoor activities. Graduations brought business to many hotels and leisure travel picked up in Washington, D.C. In Charleston, South Carolina, hotels and restaurants saw stronger sales but were concerned about the number of new establishments scheduled to open in the next year. Despite reporting high revenue, a West Virginia adventure center expressed worries about low state tourism funding.
Commercial real estate leasing rose moderately in recent weeks as brokers reported strong demand for retail and industrial space; however, reports on office demand were mixed. Vacancy rates remained low across markets, while rental rates were reportedly stable to increasing modestly. Commercial sales rose modestly, according to a few brokers, with warehouse and industrial building sites representing the majority of transactions. Commercial construction increased modestly in some regions. Multifamily leasing remained healthy in most markets.
