Wage pressures were moderate but with some signs of stronger growth. A majority of Minnesota staffing firms said wages paid by clients in the first quarter of 2018 were more than 3 percent higher than a year earlier. However, a notable majority of staffing respondents expected wages at their own firms to grow less than 3 percent. A poll of Montana human resource professionals found that close to half expected average wages this year to increase by more than 3 percent. However, a poll among Minnesota construction firms showed that 2018 wage expectations were more modest despite persistent reports of labor shortages.
Commercial real estate grew modestly since the last report. In Minneapolis-St. Paul, industrial activity saw continued growth, with solid levels of new construction and low vacancy rates. Office sales in the region have been brisk, and vacancy rates in this sector have been stable. Apartment sales have slowed year-to-date in Minneapolis-St. Paul compared with last year, though 2017 was a very strong year. The recent bankruptcy of a national retailer will see the closure of almost 40 stores and well over 1 million square feet of space in the district; this comes on top of numerous earlier chain-store closures this year. While retail vacancy rates in some cities have remained stable, others have risen, including in Eau Claire, Wis. Residential real estate was mixed. April sales in Minnesota were down 3 percent from a year earlier, with Minneapolis-St. Paul seeing a drop of almost 6 percent. However, Missoula and Bozeman, Mont., saw notably higher sales, and Sioux Falls home sales also rose slightly.
