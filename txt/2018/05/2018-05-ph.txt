On balance, wages also continued growing modestly, although reports have risen of firms losing skilled employees to competitors and struggling to attract and retain new qualified workers. Increasingly, firms are responding by adjusting their wage structures. The share of nonmanufacturing firms reporting increases remained greater than 40 percent. Banking contacts noted few signs of general wage inflation.
Staffing firms continued to report steady demand for temporary workers and direct hires in several local labor markets, with increased wage pressures in the tightest markets. According to one contact, clients are hiring faster now compared with a few years ago when they were indecisive about whether to hire and whom.
Builders continued to report rising prices, particularly for materials containing lumber, steel, and oil derivatives. Several manufacturers (and their bankers) cited rising prices for aluminum ingot, steel, and oil – some passed along the costs; however, margins shrank for others.
Looking ahead one year, nonmanufacturing firms anticipated receiving significantly higher prices for their own goods and services – a moderate increase from one quarter earlier. Manufacturing firms expected even higher prices, reflecting a small increase from their expectations last quarter. Overall, firms also reported slightly higher expectations for annual consumer inflation.
The makers of lumber products, paper products, fabricated metal products, industrial machinery, and electronic equipment tended to note gains in new orders and shipments; the makers of chemicals and primary metals reported mixed results. One primary metal manufacturer felt that the current slowdown was due to "customers waiting for clarity on the issue of steel tariffs."
Manufacturing contacts continued to expect general activity to increase over the next six months; however, the percentage of firms expecting future increases dropped below 50 percent. The percentage of firms expecting increases in future employment rose to nearly one-half, but for future capital expenditures, the percentage fell to less than one-third.
Pennsylvania auto dealers reported year-over-year gains in sales for April, while New Jersey reported declines. Dealers in both states noted that sales in early May appeared stronger; however, year-to-date sales are still a bit below last year's very high levels.
Tourism contacts continued to report modest growth overall. A Philadelphia analyst cited gains in hotel occupancy despite absorbing new supply. Shore contacts are generally optimistic for the summer season ahead. Atlantic City's casino revenues fell on a year-over-year basis in March and April.
During the current period, credit card lending began growing at a moderate pace – ending its long seasonal decline. However, credit card loan volumes have grown moderately when compared with the same period last year.
Banking contacts continued to describe credit standards as unchanged, credit quality as sound, and consumer sentiment and business confidence as high and growing. Numerous bankers noted growing pressure to raise deposit rates, especially from municipal clients.
Sales of existing homes continued to fall moderately in most major Third District markets compared with the same period last year. Brokers continued to blame a lack of new listings for moderately priced homes.
Overall, nonresidential real estate contacts reported no change in high levels of construction activity and in the modest growth in leasing activity. Construction of industrial warehouse space continued apace – "a frenzy," according to one banking contact – faster than the labor supply, according to another banker.
