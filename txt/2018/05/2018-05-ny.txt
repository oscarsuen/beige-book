Business contacts in finance and information continued to report fairly brisk hiring, while wholesalers and leisure & hospitality businesses noted moderate hiring. Firms in manufacturing, health & education, and professional & business services reported modest staffing increases, while retailers and transportation firms noted flat to declining employment. Looking ahead, contacts in finance and real estate planned to hire more briskly than those in other sectors.
Wage growth has remained modest across upstate New York but has picked up in and around New York City. While businesses in education & health services reported subdued wage increases, contacts across all other major service industries reported increasing wage pressures.
Wholesalers report widespread hikes in selling prices, while those in other sectors reported more moderate increases. Still, retailers in both upstate New York and the New York City area noted that they have been less aggressive in discounting merchandise in recent weeks, boosting effective sales prices. New York City hotels and Broadway theaters have reportedly raised prices somewhat in recent weeks, with Broadway theater ticket prices up more than 10 percent from a year earlier. Looking ahead, businesses generally said they planned moderate price increases.
New vehicle sales in upstate New York weakened in April and early May and fell well short of comparable 2017 levels. In contrast, sales of used cars picked up.

Consumer confidence in the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, PA) climbed in April, reaching its highest level in almost two decades.
Tourism in New York City has picked up further since the last report. Broadway theaters reported a pickup in both attendance and especially revenues, and retailers attributed some of a recent pickup in sales to increased tourism. New York City hotels noted an increase in occupancy rates and revenue per available room, even with a growing number of available hotel rooms.
The rental market has been mixed as well. Apartment rents have risen modestly across northern New Jersey, the Lower Hudson Valley, and upstate New York but have been flat across most of New York City, with record high landlord concessions. One exception has been The Bronx, where rents have risen fairly briskly. Throughout most of the region, the higher end of both the sales and rental market has continued to be relatively soft.
Commercial real estate markets have slackened somewhat overall. Office rents edged down in New York City and Long Island, while availability rates edged up and leasing activity slowed. Office rents and availability rates have been mostly steady across upstate New York and northern New Jersey, though leasing activity has slowed slightly. The market for retail space has also continued to soften across much of the District, though it has been steady across upstate New York. The industrial market, which had grown increasingly tight over the past year, has leveled off across much of the District, though it has continued to strengthen in northern New Jersey. A real estate industry contact noted that high rents and diminishing availability of industrial and warehouse space in New York City's outer boroughs has driven many businesses to relocate to northern and central New Jersey.
New multi-family construction starts have been steady to down slightly across the District. New industrial development has slowed as well, and new office construction has virtually ground to a halt, except in northern New Jersey, though it has slowed there as well. In all these categories, however, there continues to be a substantial volume of space under construction.
