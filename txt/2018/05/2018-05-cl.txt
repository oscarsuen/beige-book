In the auto industry, customer demand improved modestly, thanks to improving labor markets, better weather, and higher consumer confidence. Furthermore, most auto dealers expect customer demand to remain stable going into the next quarter. Some auto dealers reported weaker sales in the region relative to the rest of the country, a situation which they partly attributed to prolonged cold weather conditions. Additionally, some auto dealers indicated that lenders are tightening credit and that loan and lease payments made by consumers are rising because of higher interest rates.
Business conditions for nonresidential builders improved from what was an already strong environment. Contacts noted decreased uncertainty and pent-up demand as supporting activity and leading to increased backlogs. One contact noted his company had a record month for contracts because of manufacturing and distribution projects. Another contact noted a recent uptick in demand for speculative lease products.
