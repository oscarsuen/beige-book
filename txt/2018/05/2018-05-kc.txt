District tourism activity rebounded strongly after a slight decline during the last survey period, and contacts expected activity to increase modestly heading into the summer months. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Manufacturing activity expanded more rapidly than in the previous survey period, and the majority of other business contacts reported moderate sales increases. Factory activity accelerated at both durable and nondurable goods plants, particularly for machinery, plastics, and chemicals. Despite rising trade concerns, production, shipments, and new orders grew moderately, and activity was higher than a year ago. Manufacturers' capital spending plans remained solid, and optimism remained high for future activity. Outside of manufacturing, professional, high-tech, and transportation firms reported moderate sales growth, and wholesale trade contacts reported a strong increase in activity. All firms expected sales to rise rapidly in the next six months. Professional, high tech, and transportation contacts anticipated moderate growth in capital spending plans, and wholesale trade contacts expected strong capital spending growth in coming months. Real Estate and Construction Overall District real estate activity increased modestly as residential real estate sales were stable, residential construction activity picked up moderately, and the commercial real estate sector expanded modestly. Residential home sales and inventories were flat compared to the previous survey period, while home prices rose modestly. Sales and inventories of residential homes were expected to remain flat, while home prices were projected to increase. Residential construction activity increased moderately compared to the previous survey period and the same time last year, including higher housing starts, traffic of potential buyers, and construction supply sales. Contacts anticipated additional gains in residential construction activity in the months ahead. Commercial real estate activity continued to increase modestly as absorption, completions, construction underway, and sales increased, while vacancy rates declined. Activity in the commercial real estate sector was expected to expand further moving forward. Banking Bankers reported a modest increase in overall loan demand for the month of April. Respondents reported modest increases for commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and residential real estate loans. Consumer installment loans were down slightly, while agricultural loans were steady. Bankers indicated loan quality improved moderately compared to a year ago. In addition, respondents expected a modest increase in loan quality over the next six months. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories. Overall, bankers reported a modest increase in deposit levels. Energy District energy activity increased moderately since the last survey period with steady expectations for the future. The number of oil rigs continued to increase modestly, while the number of active gas rigs was mostly unchanged. Oil and gas production has increased and was expected to continue increasing. Activity has picked up in the Niobrara and Oklahoma shale plays. Oil prices reached their highest level since 2014, which has encouraged additional production. In Wyoming, applications for drilling permits are at record levels as producers seek opportunities to operate in the Powder River Basin. Increased oil and gas production has put pressure on energy transportation infrastructure, and new oil and gas pipeline projects have been announced for Oklahoma's Anadarko region that should alleviate some of the pressure later in the year. Agriculture The Tenth District farm economy continued to weaken but the pace of deterioration slowed due to a slight uptick in agricultural commodity prices. Prices for all major agricultural commodities in the District increased slightly during the survey period. Despite the increase in prices, farm income continued to decline and demand for financing remained high. Bankers generally expect the pace of loan demand to increase in coming months and continued to report increased interest rates on all types of agricultural loans, which could raise interest expenses for farm borrowers. However, farmland values remained relatively stable and loan delinquency rates remained low. District contacts expressed concern about liquidity in the farm sector due to further income declines, but the relative stability of farmland values provided ongoing support for both producers and lenders.
