Wage pressures were moderate since the last report. A survey of Minnesota businesses found that wage increases coalesced a little below 3 percent. There were signs of stronger increases for some workers. Union construction workers in Minnesota were seeing wage increases of 3 percent to 4 percent. Montana high tech firms expected wages to increase by 5 percent in 2018. Wage increases in the public sector were weaker. In South Dakota, state workers received an increase of 1.2 percent, while 30,000 state workers in Minnesota received a 2 percent increase this year, though roughly half were also eligible for other increases.
Commercial real estate sales grew modestly since the last report. Vacancy rates continued to remain low and stable in many real estate sectors across the District. However, the multifamily vacancy rate in Sioux Falls rose to its highest level in several years after a persistent expansion of supply. The city has also seen a number of restaurant and big-box store closures, pushing retail vacancies higher. Given the influx of new multifamily units, sources expected vacancy rates in Minneapolis-St. Paul to start rising. Residential real estate sales were slow, especially relative to demand, due to low inventories of homes for sale. Though most regions in the District have seen year-over-year sales remain flat or fall over the first two months of the year, tight inventories have persistently pushed median prices higher across the District.
