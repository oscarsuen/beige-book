While wage growth edged higher among some contacts, on balance, the pace appeared to remain modest. The share of nonmanufacturing firms reporting increases broadened to over 40 percent. However, most banking contacts continued to note few signs of wage inflation.
Staffing firms continued to report steady demand for temporary workers and direct hires in several local labor markets. Wage pressures continued to be higher in tighter markets, such as central Pennsylvania, where one firm reported wages rising 4 percent over the year.
One staffing firm noted manufacturing clients' reluctance to raise wage rates. Among our contacts, manufacturers were most likely to cite a lack of skilled labor; however, one contact recently said that "higher pay and good medical benefits help in recruiting and keeping people." That contact also noted that the firm is raising prices to cover the cost and is running at 100 percent of practical capacity. Another manufacturer stated, "It's time for private enterprise to learn more about how to bring in raw talent and train up to the requirements."
Builders continued to note rising prices for construction materials as well as labor and noted concerns about a potential trade war. Contacts cited double-digit price hikes for lumber and drywall and expressed concern for steel and reinforced concrete.
Looking ahead six months, manufacturing firms continued to anticipate higher prices, with nearly two-thirds expecting increases in prices paid and over half expecting increases in prices received for their own goods. Of the 22 manufacturing firms that offered general comments, seven mentioned impacts from recent tariffs or proposed tariffs--most noted rising prices or anticipated rising prices; just one firm anticipated greater demand.
The makers of paper products, chemicals, primary and fabricated metal products, industrial machinery, and electronic equipment tended to note gains in new orders and shipments; no sectors noted declines. The growth may be partially due to seasonal trends because the same pattern was apparent during the same period last year.
Most manufacturing contacts continued to expect general activity to increase over the next six months; the percentage of firms expecting future increases remained between 55 percent and 60 percent. The percentage of firms expecting increases in future capital expenditures and future employment also held steady at just above 40 percent.
Auto dealers continued to report modest declines in year-over-year sales this period. However, sales remain at high levels, and dealers are optimistic that the year will end with only a slight decline.
Tourism contacts continued to report modest growth overall. A Delaware contact reported heavy traffic, busy outlets, optimistic merchants, and several new hotels in the planning stages. New Jersey contacts were less optimistic regarding the local housing rental market in southern beach communities. Atlantic City's casino revenues fell on a year-over-year basis for a third consecutive month, which dampens neighboring shore activity.
Credit card lending fell further as consumers continued paying down holiday bills. Over the entire year, credit card loan volumes and total lending in all the other categories combined have grown at a moderate pace.
Banking contacts continued to describe solid ongoing economic growth in most parts of the District, with high consumer sentiment and business confidence. Overall, contacts noted that credit standards remain unchanged and credit quality remains very sound.
According to Third District brokers, ongoing low inventories of houses for sale continued to constrain sales and place upward pressure on prices. Sales of existing homes fell moderately in February across most major markets compared with the same period last year; brokers saw no signs of an improvement in March.
Nonresidential real estate contacts reported no change in the already high levels of construction activity and the modest growth in leasing activity. Contractors report sufficient work to carry through to year-end, but a few new projects must break ground to maintain current activity levels through 2019. Although demand varies by sector and geography, rents tend to be rising in many markets, especially for industrial/warehouse sectors everywhere and for most sectors within the city of Philadelphia.
