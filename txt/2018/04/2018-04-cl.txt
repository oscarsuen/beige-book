Among nonresidential construction firms, demand generally improved during the survey period and on a year-over-year basis thanks to more opportunities for projects emerging, especially as the weather improves. Increases in backlogs, inquiries, and bidding were observed. Current levels of activity are expected to continue into the summer months. Almost all nonresidential contractors reported that rising construction costs (materials, labor, and transportation) are among the biggest challenges they are facing currently.
