Trucking companies continued see robust growth, with many facing more freight than they could handle. However, several companies had more success hiring drivers in the past few weeks, which helped to increase their capacity. Even with this capacity boost, firms had to turn away business because they were unable to meet demand. Several trucking firms were also concerned about rising equipment and repair costs potentially leading to a shortage of trucks that could add to capacity constraints.
Tourist activity was mixed in recent weeks, due in part to adverse weather conditions. A Virginia ski resort was unable to make up losses after temporarily closing for unusually warm weather. At the same time, the nor'easter storms caused flight cancellations and shutdowns in Washington, D.C., leaving hotels in the area with low occupancy rates. Hotels in Charleston, South Carolina also had low occupancy rates, but attributed them to increased supply as demand for rooms actually rose in the area. Meanwhile, some North Carolina restaurants and hotels reported strong demand despite difficult travel conditions created by winter storms. Hotels and tourist attractions around the District were optimistic that business would improve along with the weather in the coming weeks.
