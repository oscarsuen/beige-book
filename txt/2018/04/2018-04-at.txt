Overall, reports of wage growth were mixed across the District. Many contacts noted steady but modest wage growth; however, geographies and sectors experiencing high growth continued to report large wage increases in order to attract and retain workers. In particular, contacts from the transportation sector reported that they were compelled to provide drivers with sizeable bonuses and wage increases in an attempt to thwart turnover. Employers continued to share that they were increasing the proportion of employee compensation that is not permanent and can be withdrawn, if needed (e.g., bonuses, incentives, etc.).
Travel and tourism contacts reported strong domestic travel while group and convention travel softened since the last report. Demand for hotel rooms accelerated even though occupancy rates declined due to an increase in the number of rooms coming on line and a pick-up in online lodging services. Sentiment from travel and tourism contacts remains optimistic heading into spring.
District commercial real estate contacts cited continued improvement in general economic conditions and the availability of capital as factors supporting favorable commercial real estate demand and pricing. However, contacts continued to caution that the rate of improvement varied by metropolitan area, submarket, and property type. Contacts continued to report healthy activity pipelines. The outlook among commercial contacts for nonresidential and multifamily construction remained positive, with the majority anticipating activity to match or exceed the current level.
