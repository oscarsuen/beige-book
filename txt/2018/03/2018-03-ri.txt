Trucking companies saw sustained growth in recent weeks, and many reported being unable to meet increased demand. A North Carolina company reported demand of about two truckloads for every available truck. Trucking companies have continued to turn away business because of driver shortages and expect this problem to worsen in coming months as shipments pick up seasonally in the spring.
Tourism remained robust in recent weeks. Hotel stays around the District continued to increase; however, some North Carolina hotels reported that their business was suffering from increasing competition, despite strong tourism. A Virginia outdoor center reported having to turn away visitors as bookings increased. Tourism in D.C. adjusted down to normal levels compared to abnormally strong business last winter. Also, it did not suffer as much from the federal government shutdown as in the past because of its brevity. District ski resorts experienced a strong season, after a few weak years. However, winter weather hurt tourism elsewhere in the District, particularly in South Carolina, where the Charleston airport was shut down for four days.
In commercial real estate, traffic and sales increased and prices were steady in recent weeks, although activity varied by geographic area and industry segment. An executive from Columbia, SC and another from Richmond, VA reported speculative construction in the industrial market. The Columbia report also noted strong activity in retail, including construction of small retail space. There was also steady demand for restaurant space. There were a few reports of slowing office-related activity. On the other hand, office activity expanded in Virginia Beach and there was strong demand for Class A urban office space and Class B suburban space in the Charlotte, NC area.
