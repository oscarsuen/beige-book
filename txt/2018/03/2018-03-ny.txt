Business contacts in most industries indicated that they are expanding staff modestly, with the exception of retailers, who indicated that they have reduced staff slightly. Hiring plans for the months ahead have remained fairly strong.
Businesses in the service sector reported further acceleration in wages, and a sizable proportion of firms across most industries indicated plans to raise wages in the months ahead. A New York City agency reports that most new hiring involves recruiting candidates who are already employed, and that this has made businesses increasingly negotiable on wages. A number of contacts in industries such as health care, retail, and restaurants noted they have been squeezed by wage pressures, including the recent hike in New York State's minimum wage rates. Some businesses have refrained from raising wages that are already above the new minimum.

New York City's co-op and condo market has also seen fairly brisk activity, though apartment prices have been flat overall--up modestly at the lower end but down at the high end of the market. The inventory of homes on the market was reported to be very thin throughout the District, except in Manhattan where it has been steady at a moderate level.
Rental markets have been mixed but, on balance, softer. New York City's rental market has weakened further, particularly at the high end. Effective rents have trended down, reflecting a combination of modestly declining face rents and rising landlord concessions. While these concessions have been common for high-end rentals for some time, they have recently been used on lower-priced units as well. However, rental markets in northern New Jersey, upstate New York, and the suburbs around New York City have held up better, with rents steady to up modestly.
Commercial real estate markets have been mixed. Office availability rates were steady to up slightly, while asking rents were mostly flat. The retail market has slackened more noticeably, especially in New York City, where vacancy rates have climbed to multi-year highs. In northern New Jersey and upstate New York, retail vacancies have been fairly stable. The industrial market, in contrast, has continued to strengthen, as availability rates have continued to decline throughout the District. Industrial rents in and around New York City and northern New Jersey have risen at more than a 10 percent pace, while rents in upstate New York have been stable.
Multi-family construction activity has remained brisk in northern New Jersey and has picked up across upstate New York, but has slowed in New York City. Office construction has been subdued, but industrial construction has been fairly robust.
