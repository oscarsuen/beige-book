Businesses in most industries report steady to modestly rising employment. In the finance, professional & business services, and manufacturing industries fewer contacts than last time indicated that they are adding workers. On the other hand, businesses in wholesale trade, leisure & hospitality, and education & health services noted some pickup in hiring activity. Retailers reported little change in staffing levels, and one large chain said they plan to hire roughly the same number of holiday-season workers as in 2017.
Wage pressures have remained fairly widespread. While businesses in most industries noted that wage growth has remained moderate thus far, a growing proportion reported that they plan to raise wages in the months ahead. A New York City employment agency noted a widening gap between salary expectations of job applicants and what employers are offering.
More businesses than in recent months said they had raised selling prices--most notably in wholesale trade and leisure & hospitality. Retailers generally indicated that selling prices have been stable to up modestly. A sizable and rising proportion of contacts in wholesale trade and transportation said they planned to hike prices in the months ahead, while fewer leisure & hospitality firms said they would do so. A few contacts in manufacturing and distribution cited tariffs for driving up costs and inducing them to raise their prices.

The apartment rental market has been mixed. Manhattan's vacancy rate declined to its lowest level in a decade, reflecting a noticeable expansion in landlord concessions. Effective rents have trended down across New York City due to these increased concessions.

In northern New Jersey, however, availability rates edged down, while rents were flat.
