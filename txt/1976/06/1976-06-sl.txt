Business activity in the Eighth Federal Reserve District continues   upward, according to reports of area businessmen. Consumer demand   remains strong, especially for automobiles and other durable goods.   Manufacturing activity, though still somewhat below capacity, is   improving. Increased operating ratios for manufacturing firms have   so far had little impact on prices. Financial institutions report   some increase in interest rates as loan demands inch up. Savings   flows into thrift institutions continue to increase but at a more   moderate rate than in the first quarter of the year.
Retail sales continued to register overall gains in recent weeks,   but department store representatives report that increases in sales   have not been as large as expected. Sales increased in May at only   about one-half the expected rate of gain. Analysts point out that   comparisons with year-ago sales may be biased by the expenditures   associated with the tax rebates last year. In addition, the slower   rate of growth in department store sales may reflect the rising   consumer preference for automobiles and other durable goods.   Appliance and automobile sales are reported to have been excellent   in recent weeks.
This month's interviews with manufacturing firms were conducted with   special emphasis on current operations as a percent of normal   capacity and the pressures that rising operating levels have had on   prices. In general, firms are reported to be operating somewhat   below normal capacity. Lack of demand is the reason most often given   for this   less-than-capacity level of output. But demand is   continuing to increase and excess capacity is declining. A steel   representative reports current utilization is slightly over 80   percent of capacity. Price increases for steel products, which go   into effect this month, were reported to be necessary to cover   capital costs. A major feed and food processor reported operations   in this sector to be about 70 to 75 percent of capacity, with upward   pressures on prices not expected until at least 90 percent of   capacity is attained. A manufacturer of welding equipment is   operating currently at 90 percent of capacity on some items while at   full capacity on others. A representative of this firm noted that   raw material prices are increasing rapidly and that his firm's   prices will be increased soon. An auto assembly plant in the St.   Louis area has plans to operate at full capacity for the first time   since 1974 by adding a second shift this fall. A manufacturer of   electric motors for appliances also reported operating at virtual   capacity in recent months.
Representatives of a few industries reported a shortage of capacity   at the present time, and large price increases for products of these   industries are expected. A distributor of hydraulic equipment parts   noted that a seller's market has developed for these products.   Capacity has not been increased substantially in this industry   during the past few years, and rising demands have resulted in order   backlogs up to six months. Some products used in the oil and gas   industry were also reported to be in short supply, though price   increases for these products have so far been moderate. However,   increases in basic raw material costs for this industry are expected   to contribute to price increases in the near future.
Interest rates are beginning to inch up again, according to reports   from area bankers and thrift institution officials. The most   prevalent mortgage rate in St. Louis is still 8 1/2 percent on an   80-percent loan, but 8 3/4 percent is becoming increasingly common.   One savings and loan representative predicted that 8 3/4 percent   would become the dominant rate within another month. The pressure   for mortgage rates to rise locally is said to reflect higher-yielding investment opportunities in national markets rather than   any sharp upturn in local mortgage demand. Business loan demand at   commercial banks has inched up in recent weeks, according to   representatives of larger banks. Gains in volume of real estate,   consumer installment, and agricultural loans were registered in May.   One bank predicted an increase in loan demand through the summer,   with an accompanying increase in rates charged.
Statistics for the St. Louis area show no growth of savings deposits   at savings and loan associations in April, but reports indicate some   increase in May. Reports from other areas also indicate savings   deposits continue to make gains but at a reduced rate from earlier   in the year. Minor changes in rates offered on deposits at several   savings and loan associations were noted in recent weeks. Minimum   amounts for long-term certificates at some associations were raised   from $1,000 to $10,000 or more, and the rates paid were reduced by      one-fourth of one percent. The recent tendency for mortgage rates to   rise is expected to forestall further rate reductions on deposits.
