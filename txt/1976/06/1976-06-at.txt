The southeastern economy continues to expand, although the advance   remains uneven: Capacity utilization rates are high in most major   industries. Yet manufacturers report no unusual shortages or   bottlenecks of raw materials, with the exception of natural gas.   Consumer spending remains strong in some areas but has weakened in   others. Florida's phosphate industry began layoffs; the continuing   rubber strike also reduced employment.
Consumer spending in the Southeast has become ambivalent. Autos and   trucks are selling well throughout the District, and mobile home   sales are strong in some places. Sales of soft goods, however, have   leveled off in several areas. This development may reflect a   weakening of business activity or simply a growing emphasis by   consumers on durable goods purchases.
Florida's phosphate industry has begun layoffs because export demand   and domestic fertilizer sales are low. High prices and the Midwest   drought have reduced fertilizer applications. Phosphate inventories   are at a five-year high. Two companies have laid off 350 workers,   while a third has idled 1,000 of 1,300 workers. The ongoing rubber   strike has reduced employment in Alabama.
The shortage which primarily concerns southeastern industries is   natural gas. There is little worry about the supply of electric   power, although in some areas the cost of electricity is uncertain   because natural gas curtailment necessitates substitution of more   costly fuels. In one area of the District, gas cutoff to customers   with interruptible service is expected for 320 days in 1976 compared   to 50 days in 1974; there is concern that this makes the locality   unattractive to manufacturers seeking plant locations. Many   companies report programs for energy conservation and installation   of stand-by energy systems, so their major worry is the impact of a   gas shortage on costs rather than continuity of production. However,   these programs absorb capital which might otherwise be used to   enlarge production capacity.
Three automobile assembly plants in the Atlanta area, which   manufacture intermediate- and full-size cars as well as light   trucks, report production at record levels. Yet, with the obvious   exception of tires, no supply problems are reported. A small   tiremaker expects the current strike-induced shortage to persist   because of the difficulty of replenishing rapidly depleting   inventories while meeting new vehicle production requirements, as   well as seasonally high replacement demand. Mobile home   manufacturers are still operating with significant excess capacity,   and no raw material shortages are occurring.
A major steel producer estimates industry operations at 80 to 90   percent of capacity but reports no shortages. Lead times are   increasing on flat-rolled steel used in consumer products, and some   talk is heard of allocations in late 1976. Steel grades used for   capital goods manufacturing and heavy construction are in abundant   supply. A large distributor of metal products notes an excess of   goods and states that shortages of flat-rolled steel caused by   increased automobile output have been relieved by production   adjustments. This source foresees no serious stringencies until the   capital goods and heavy construction industries resume higher   operating levels.
Among companies using metal products, a manufacturer of school buses   and a distributor which stocks over 90,000 automobile replacement   parts find no unusual supply problems. Other steel users have   current shortages of some steel products or are expecting them. Some   firms are building inventories in anticipation of shortages and   higher prices. In nonferrous metals, shortages are reported for   aluminum sheets and aluminum plates used for printing. Large   chemical companies are utilizing 90 to 100 percent of capacity; this   level is expected to continue. No shortages other than natural gas   are reported or expected. Most firms are constructing sizable   additions to capacity.
Textile mills are now operating at 85 to 100 percent of capacity,   based on three daily work shifts. New capacity for denim production   is currently under construction. Prospects for cotton prices have   caused some worry in view of crop forecasts and strong foreign   demand, but no raw material bottlenecks are reported or foreseen. In   apparel, present levels of production vary but are expected to reach   full capacity use by year-end. Output is being increased by hiring   rather than by plant expansion. The only evidence of shortages is   longer lead times for synthetic and spun yarn fabrics. Some reports   suggest that retailers' and manufacturers' reluctance to build   inventories may result in an influx of last-minute orders for fall   goods which will be impossible to fill.
In the carpet industry, unused capacity is abundant and should not   be exhausted in 1976. Plant investment is primarily in the form of   product line changes and additions to distribution facilities,   although one latex manufacturing plant is being built.   Transportation is adequate, but truck carrier costs are a major   source of price increases. Overcapacity among fiber producers has   recently led to some price reductions.
Paper producers' capacity use has risen sharply during the past year   and is approaching full utilization; it is expected to remain high.   Price increases and some shortages have recently occurred for   newsprint; cardboard containers have also been reported in short   supply. Some producers regard restriction of timber cutting in   national forests as a potential threat to raw material supplies. No   reports of pulpwood or chemicals shortages have been received.
Wood products companies present a contrasting picture. A   manufacturer of pine and paper chemicals, with capacity usage at 75   percent, finds no raw material problems. But a lumber exporter is   experiencing bottlenecks in raw materials and finished goods, which   he expects to continue for the remainder of the year despite   operating levels well below capacity.
