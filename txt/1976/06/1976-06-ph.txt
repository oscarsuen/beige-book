Economic conditions in the Third District are improving but at an   uneven pace. Retail activity has softened, while the manufacturing   sector continues to expand. Increases are reported in new orders,   shipments, and employment, while inventories in manufacturing are   lower. The longer-term outlook both in retailing and manufacturing   remains optimistic. Bankers report that consumer loans are inching   up but see no signs yet of any pickup in business borrowing.   Businessmen indicate that prices continue to rise, but inflationary   pressures are about the same as last month. Major manufacturers in   the District report no current bottlenecks in production and expect   no significant problems within the next 12 months.
District manufacturers, responding to the latest business outlook   survey, report a higher level of economic activity than last month.   Close to one-half of the businessmen surveyed see an improvement in   general business conditions. Specifically, 38 percent of the   respondents indicate gains in new orders and 36 percent note   increases in shipments. This is similar to the proportions reporting   increases last month but below the gains reported in March and   April. Employment in manufacturing shows additional improvement this   month. The factory workweek is longer for the fourth month in a row,   and work forces are rising at 17 percent of the businesses surveyed.   The proportion of firms indicating fewer jobs dropped from 16   percent in March to only 2 percent in the latest survey. At the same   time, inventory levels declined this month for the first time since   January. The outlook in manufacturing for the next six months is for   further expansion. Of the executives polled, 79 percent look for an   improved business climate by December. Further gains are expected   for employment as well: One-fourth of the respondents project a   longer workweek and four out of ten expect to hire additional   employees. At the same time, 43 percent of the manufacturers   surveyed anticipate increases in inventories. This is down somewhat   from last month, when 53 percent were projecting gains six months   out. Plans for increases in capital expenditures are off slightly as   well. Thirty-four percent of the respondents in the current survey   plan to hike their spending for plant and equipment, compared to 46   percent last month.
On the price front, manufacturers report paying and receiving higher   prices, but there is little change in the distribution of responses   from last month. Forty-nine percent of those surveyed report paying   more for their inputs, and 17 percent are charging more for their   finished products. By December, 87 percent expect to be paying more   for supplies and 72 percent anticipate higher prices for the   products they sell. In the retail sector, prices are currently   reported to be increasing "moderately."
Area retailers report a slowdown in sales but continue to be   optimistic for the rest of this year. Merchants are unanimous in   labeling retail activity as "disappointing" in the latest sales   period. Reported sales volumes range from 2 percent above to 4   percent below the same period last year. Most of the retailers note   that the whole spectrum of wearing apparel was especially weak. One   merchant notes additional weakness in draperies, housewares, and   major appliances. Several reasons are offered for this softening in   sales: a stretch of unseasonably cold weather, the necessity for   consumers to begin paying for installment purchases made in the   first quarter, and the absence of a boost to spendable income like   that provided by the tax rebate last year. Despite current sales   performance, retailers continue to be optimistic for the remainder   of 1976. However, as one executive put it, "If the next sales period   turns out to be as disappointing as the current one, we'll have to   adjust our sights for the fall."
Bankers in the District report that loan volume continues to be   soft. Consumer loans are moving up slightly, while business loans   are characterized as "flat." Bankers are unanimous in citing high   levels of corporate liquidity and a very cautious approach to   building inventories as reasons for soft business loan demand. There   is general agreement that loan volume will be higher by year-end,   but bankers are uncertain about the timing and degree of the pickup.   The consensus is for a mild increase in the third quarter and for "somewhat more strength" in the final quarter of the year.
Interest rates are expected to move upward gradually. The majority   of bankers contacted anticipate a prime rate of 8 percent by the end   of this year, with one seeing the possibility of 8 1/2 percent. None   of the financial executives contacted feel that the anticipated rise   in interest rates through the first quarter of 1977 will hamper   economic expansion. However, several are concerned that the recovery   in housing may be slowed if long-term rates continue to move up.
The question of capacity utilization and bottlenecks in production   was explored with executives in the food, apparel, chemical,   petroleum, steel, nonelectrical machinery, and electrical machinery   industries. Estimates of present capacity utilization by these   businessmen range from 55 percent at one steel company to 95 percent   at a firm in the apparel industry. However, not many of the firms   contacted report current rates close to these extremes. Most of the   reported current operating rates lie within the 70-85-percent range.   In general, capacity utilization is now about 20 percentage points   above levels recorded in the first and second quarters of 1975.
Manufacturers report that they are presently experiencing no   constraints on production. There are no reported problems with raw   materials, labor, or fuel requirements. There are scattered reports   of large price increases for some raw materials, but these are not   considered to be hampering production. For example, one clothing   manufacturer notes that piece cloth prices are now 160 percent above   two years ago, but he adds that this is causing him no problems. In   addition, a producer of nonelectrical machinery reports that cotton   imported from the Far East costs twice as much today as it did a   year ago. However, he is still ordering with relatively short lead   times for delivery. In 1973 and 1974, this businessman was ordering   cotton from the Far East a year ahead of the desired delivery time,   whereas now he is ordering only three months out. At the same time,   some manufacturers report an improvement in their supply picture. A   producer of canned foods indicates that it is easier to obtain   tinplate now than it was in 1974, and a chemical manufacturer notes   an improvement in natural gas supplies. According to this executive, "We were under the threat of a natural gas shortage in the fall of   1975, but we've been informed that supplies will be adequate at   least through this winter."
For the longer term, most of the manufacturers contacted feel that   they can meet anticipated increases in demand. The clothing   manufacturer, whose firm is running at 95 percent of capacity, has   recently enlarged an existing plant by 50 percent and, along with   subcontracting, expects to be able to meet customers' needs through   the fall. All of the manufacturers contacted project higher   operating rates by year-end, but there are no concrete expectations   of plant and equipment constraints within the next 9-12 months.   There is more uncertainty about the second half of 1977, however,   and some executives see the "possibility" of running into capacity   constraints by late 1977. Nevertheless, those who see such a threat   are not expecting a return to the severe conditions of 1974.
