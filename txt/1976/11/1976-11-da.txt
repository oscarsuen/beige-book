The major regional economic indicators suggest that business   conditions in the Eleventh District have begun to strengthen.   Although mining output is off, production in manufacturing is up   sharply, led by large gains in such major nondurable goods   industries as chemicals and refining. Housing starts in Texas are at   the highest level since January 1973, and there are 19,000 more   construction jobs than a year ago. The growth in total employment in   the Southwest has reduced the unemployment rate to 6.3 percent from   a peak of 7.0 percent in September 1975. This month's survey   suggests that new car sales are climbing again, and new orders for   women's and children's clothing have picked up. Total bank loan   demand remains on a plateau, but loan demand for multifamily   construction and irrigation farming is increasing.
Demand for new automobiles appears to be growing, following a lull   in sales during September and early October. Part of the recent   increase, however, is attributable to fleet sales that obscure   underlying consumer demand. However, all auto dealers interviewed   anticipate strong sales during the 1977 model year. A few dealers   expect sales will pick up significantly now that the Presidential   election is over. There is no indication of unfavorable consumer   reaction to the reduction in size of GM models or to the average 6-percent increase in new car prices. Some used car sales, however,   are attributed to higher prices for new cars. Almost all dealers   indicate that their inventories are lower than they would like. Ford   dealers are experiencing a slow pickup in deliveries since the auto   strike ended, and GM dealers report that it is difficult to get   enough of the most popular models.
The outlook for apparel sales is mixed, according to market   observers at recent showings of spring merchandise at the Dallas   Apparel Mart. The number of buyers at the women's and children's   market was 10 percent higher than a year ago, and the volume of new   orders was up an estimated 20 percent. Inventories at most buyer   outlets—largely "mom and pop" stores—were reported to be low. The   biggest price increases were reported for articles made of denim and   for children's wear. For all goods, higher priced merchandise tended   to sell better than medium- or low-priced goods.
New orders for men's clothing were off at the latest market. Partly   because few style innovations have occurred in the past two years,   consumers appear content with their current wardrobes. Some price   increases in men s clothing have occurred, especially for shirts and   worsted goods. Industry spokesmen note that consumer price   resistance for men's suits begins at about $165 in department   stores, while price resistance for similar goods sold in specialty   clothing stores begins at about $200.
Interviews with District bankers suggest that business loan demand   continues "disappointedly flat" and in some cases is falling. The   long anticipated turnaround has not appeared, and several bankers   now put off to mid-1977 an expected rise in business loan demand.   Loans to the petroleum industry for drilling and developing fields   continue to be the only area of significant strength. Although   commercial and industrial loans remain weak, loans to local firms,   in contrast to national firms, have been coming in better.
Consumer loan demand is lackluster. With the exception of the   Houston area, there is little or no growth in credit card usage or   delinquencies. A Fort Worth banker reported that repayments in   credit card accounts are outstripping sales, and a Dallas banker   noted the high level of savings was impeding growth in consumer loan   demand. New car loans are weak because many purchases are being   financed through sales finance companies. Several bankers indicated   that real estate loans—especially for construction of multifamily   housing—have bottomed out and appear to be in an initial state of   recovery.
Country bankers report that operating loans for irrigation farming   are being spurred by sharply higher production costs and lower   market prices for grain. But bankers are firming collateral   requirements as a means of reducing loan risks. And many bankers   indicate that the net worth of borrowers will become a more   important factor in the evaluation of farm loans in the future. A   banker in the High Plains of Texas stated that marginal tenant   farmers will likely have difficulty in obtaining sufficient   operating capital next year to meet their projected needs. Another   banker reported that financing of many tenant farmers will likely   require more participation of the Farmers Home Administration and/or   the Small Business Administration in making guaranteed loans.
Most of the bankers interviewed indicated that with continued   expectations for an impending rise in loan demand, they plan to   maintain a liquid investment portfolio. Because the tax-exempt   advantages of municipal obligations are currently less attractive,   the major portion of new acquisitions is mainly comprised of U.S.   Treasury issues. More banks, however, are lengthening the maturity   structure of their investment portfolios somewhat in order to obtain   the higher rates of return available on intermediate-term Government   securities and, thus, help offset the slower growth in income from   loans.
