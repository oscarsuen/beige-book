Sales by large retailers in major Tenth District cities generally   exceeded expectations in October, resulting in a moderately   optimistic outlook for the Christmas season. Retail inventories are   generally reported to be about right, although a sizable minority of   respondents had larger stocks than they desired. Dealers are   uniformly optimistic about sales of the 1977 model cars. Plentiful   grain stocks and livestock inventories are likely to help hold the   increase in food prices down in 1977. Ranchers and cattle feeders   are having a difficult time and—along with wheat farmers   withholding grain from market—are a source of higher loan demand at   District banks. Otherwise, bankers report only a stable loan demand.
Large retailers in major cities in the Tenth District generally   report sales in October to have exceeded expectations, following   somewhat weaker September sales. (Exceptions were not uniform with   regard either to type of store or to geographic location.) The   improved October performance has apparently resulted in some   increased optimism for sales in the Christmas season, although the   degree of optimism can only be described as moderate overall. One   large catalog sales company reports that its Christmas sales are   ahead of its expectations.
With few exceptions, stores reporting on relative strength or   weakness of various product lines noted greater strength for   durables than for nondurable goods. Appliances, home improvement   items, and auto accessories were identified among durables selling   well; the, picture for other home furnishings was mixed. Sales of   both men's and women's clothes were generally reported to be strong,   although some instances of weakness in women's apparel sales were   reported.
Most retailers described their inventories as being about at the   level they wanted them. One respondent described his stocks as "right for expected sales;" another indicated that inventories had   been too heavy until his store's October sales increase. A sizable   minority of respondents reported larger stocks than desired,   however.
Nearly all retailers contacted spoke of a steady pattern of price   increases for the things they buy, but with no unusual or   outstanding price rises. Several respondents indicated that their   own markups are holding steady. Retailers in the Tenth District   report that the United Parcel Service strike has had very little   impact, or none at all, on their operations.
Sellers of domestic new automobiles in the Tenth District are   uniformly optimistic about sales of the 1977 model cars. Full-sized   and intermediate-sized cars are selling best; sales of compacts and   subcompacts are still weak. Most dealers continue to sell cars   heavily loaded with optional equipment. New car inventories are   generally low, with few exceptions; this goes beyond Ford dealers   still feeling the impact of the strike. Dealers generally report   that 1977 model sales would be better if their inventory situation   were better.
Although farm prices fell 5 per cent during the month ended October   15 to a level 9 per cent below a year ago, price gains during the   first half of the year will hold the 1976 average very close to the   figure for 1975. Food prices, therefore, have exhibited greater   stability this year than in the previous 3 years—rising an   estimated 3 to 4 per cent. Recent reports on grain stocks and   livestock inventories suggest that food supplies will remain   plentiful at least until midyear 1977, which should help keep the   lid on food prices. Most of next year's pressures on food prices are   likely to arise from probable increases in marketing charges for   labor, processing, packaging and the like. As a result, some   acceleration in the rate of increase for food prices seems likely in   1977.
This has been a difficult year for ranchers and cattle feeders in   the Tenth District. Agricultural bankers responding to the October 1   agricultural credit survey indicated only 13 per cent of their   rancher and feeder customers would increase their net worths this   year, while 50 per cent expected a decline. A large percentage of   those expecting increases or no change in net worths attributed this   solely to higher land values. One banker noted, "The land value   increase is about the only answer to holding property statements   together."
Higher input costs, low cattle prices, and slow selling by wheat   farmers—who are holding crops for better prices—have resulted in   markedly higher farm loan demand in the Tenth District from a year   ago. Over 72 per cent of the bankers reported an increase in loan   demand, and 39 per cent noted a decrease in loanable funds. Lower   rates of loan repayments and more loan renewals or extensions were   noted by just over half the bankers. These trends were particularly   noticeable in the cattle and wheat raising areas of the District.
Total loans increased at Tenth District banks in October. However,   bankers contacted for the survey reported only a stable loan demand.   Most stated that they would like to build up their business loans   and are actively seeking new corporate customers. They reported   normal to good automobile sales for their areas, but most stated   that their automobile loans had not increased because their terms   were not competitive with other automobile financers. One banker   reported a brisk pick up in loans to retailers due to earlier than   usual shipments of Christmas merchandise.
The recent declines in the prime rate have resulted in pressure on   earnings for several banks. These bankers stated they were trying to   trim their costs primarily by reducing overhead. Also, they have   lowered their rates on large CD's and reduced their purchases of   Federal funds. Bankers are reluctant to reduce the rate on consumer-type time accounts from the maximums because of the competition for   these deposits.
