Increases in manufacturing output account for the bulk of economic   strength in the Eleventh District, although much excess capacity is   still evident. Total employment in the District continues to be   soft, and total construction activity remains weak. Department store   sales are up moderately from a year earlier, and automobile sales   exhibit continued strength in the full-size and intermediate-model   ranges.
Department store sales in the Eleventh District continue to grow   sluggishly and are falling short of many retailers' expectations.   The modest growth in sales is shared by both hard and soft goods.   Retail inventories are being held in line with current volume of   sales. Nevertheless, if real sales gains do not materialize, an   involuntary inventory buildup may occur before yearend, according to   several retailers.
Automobile sales are good as full-size and intermediate-size cars   lead the sales advance. Truck and van sales are also doing quite   well, Car sales are being limited by two factors. First,   overwhelming demand for full- and intermediate-size cars has   resulted in a shortage of the more popular models. Second, there has   been some softening in overall car demand as consumers wait to   assess the 1977 models. Small car sales continue weak, and   inventories have risen to undesirable levels. Most automobile   dealers surveyed do not feel the announced price increases will   adversely affect sales. Financing is readily available, and a   movement toward extended term (42 and 48 months) automobile   financing is gaining momentum.
Primary metal production has begun to accelerate. The aluminum   industry is operating at approximately 77 percent of capacity, but   output is up because of the recent reactivation of idle capacity at   two major plants. Inventories are at low levels, and production   bottlenecks are not anticipated. The cost and availability of energy   will continue to be a potential constraint upon production levels.
Most steel plants are operating at between 75 and 80 percent of   capacity. Inventories here, too, are at reasonable levels, and no   immediate shortages are expected. Prices remain relatively low as a   result of continued weak demand for construction steel products.   Steel producers, however, are anticipating stronger sales in the   fourth quarter.
Petroleum refining production in Texas has increased to nearly 90   percent of capacity. Inventories are currently in line with the   volume of sales, but a buildup by the middle of the fourth quarter   is predicted. The prices of primary inputs have increased over the   past year, and the increases have been passed on to customers with   little impact on demand.
Apparel production in Texas has increased following a summer lull,   and the industry is attempting to gradually reduce current excess   capacity. Manufacturers in Dallas and Houston report good sales.   Both input and finished goods prices are up. El Paso manufacturers,   however, indicate sales are sluggish and are cutting prices to move   out older inventories, The industry is anticipating a steady rise in   sales during the fourth quarter.
Demand for oil field equipment is being dampened by the continuing   uncertainty resulting from the Federal ruling to raise the price   ceilings for natural gas. Output has increased somewhat, and   inventories are generally in line with sales. Production is running   at approximately 75 percent of capacity, but price increases for   many products are being planned.
Chemical production is above last year's level but has failed to   exhibit real strength in recent months. Capacity utilization is   estimated at 85 percent. Inventories are being kept tightly in line   with anticipated sales to prevent involuntary buildups. Demand is   expected to strengthen in the next few months.
Output by the paper industry has weakened with the end of a 6-month   strike in the Canadian paper industry. Production, however, is still   above last year's levels, and demand is expected to grow at an   average rate by historical standards. Finished goods prices have   remained relatively stable, and inventories are well within   manageable levels.
The devaluation of the Mexican peso had an immediate effect upon the   border economy. Retail sales to Mexican Nationals have dropped   substantially. In El Paso, total sales are off a third, and many   lay-away purchases by Mexicans have been canceled. Moreover, many   Mexicans who have made purchases on time are either requesting   extensions of their contracts in order to cut their monthly dollar   payments or are having their purchase repossessed. The largest   beneficiaries of the devaluation are the twin plant industries along   the border whose total wage bills have been cut sharply. This   windfall savings to American businesses is expected to decline,   however, as Mexican labor unions are currently pressuring for   increases in their country's minimum wage.
