In early September, several bank directors expressed general concern   and uncertainty about how the sustained dry weather would affect   District agriculture. The already poor prospects for the corn and   soybean harvests have been further reduced, but the wheat harvest   was quite good. Directors believed the corn and soybean prices would   rise in the coming months as wheat prices remain stable or decline.
The confused cattle industry was expected to continue to feel the   effects of the drought too. Dryness and high feed prices helped to   increase livestock marketings and further depress fed cattle prices   to their current low levels. Directors expected higher corn and   soybean prices to make profitable livestock feeding still more   difficult. However, as the number of cattle declines, livestock   prices should improve.
The drought's full impact on the District's farm economy was   considered hard to assess. The big crunch should not come until   after the 1976 harvest, but the drought's effects could linger for   several years.
Drought conditions were already curtailing consumer spending in dry   rural areas. A director from Central Minnesota, for example, felt   dry weather had noticeably affected his area's spending in recent   weeks, and a North Dakota director said uncertainty about the   agricultural situation had cut sales of big-ticket items there.   Also, farm implement sales were reportedly off quite sharply in the   dry areas of Minnesota and South Dakota.
In areas without drought conditions, however, consumer spending was   said to be quite good. One large Minneapolis-St. Paul retailer said   that after a disappointing August business picked up in early   September. In Western South Dakota retail sales were fairly strong   this summer and tourist spending was 20 to 30 percent ahead of a   year ago. And two directors reported good auto sales in their areas.   Consumer spending was curbed somewhat by layoffs and labor disputes   in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and tourists there were spending   less than in other years. But several directors said retailers in   their areas expected a good fall and winter.
Even more strength was reported by District manufacturers. According   to our August survey, current dollar sales of manufactured goods   grew 20.3 percent over a year-ago in the second quarter, the most   since the recovery in this sector began in the fourth quarter of   1975, and this is much more than the gain expected in the previous   survey. Manufacturing gains were fairly evenly distributed among   durable and nondurable goods industries, which were up 21.6 percent   and 18.7 percent, respectively.
Their strong second-quarter sales gains probably caused District   manufacturers to revise upward their expectations for the next three   quarters. In the previous survey last May, they saw sales gains   tapering off in the fourth quarter of 1976; but in the latest   survey, they looked for fairly substantial advances over a year ago   through at least early 1977: 16.3 and 16.0 percent increases in the   last two quarters of this year and a 14.9 percent increase in the   first quarter of 1977.
Bank directors unanimously said material shortages were not a   problem here in early September. Although some concern was expressed   about the long-term situation, energy supplies were considered   adequate for the winter. The District's farm implement shortages   have substantially eased. One director did report some delays in   receiving merchandise, but they were termed not excessive.
