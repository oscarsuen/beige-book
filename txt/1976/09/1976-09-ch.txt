Many business executives, who report demand for their products to be   far less robust than in 1973 and early 1974, emphasize that they   look back upon the chaotic multiple-ordering and gray markets of   that period with horror. Distortions, partly caused by price   controls, made accurate readings of the underlying strength of their   markets impossible. Businesses are attempting to keep tight control   on costs relating to capital expenditures, purchase commitments, and   use of labor. Some say that "the financial people are in control   today," rather than the sales people who made the big decisions in   the last boom.
Lead times have lengthened further on average, despite margins of   unused capacity. Cancellation of the scheduled October 1 steel price   boost reflects buyer resistance and their reluctance to build   inventories. Except for a few items such as special castings, there   are no reports of current shortages. The 130-day tire strike,   apparently, did not affect vehicle output at all, but supplies of   snow tires may be tight this winter. Relatively easy supply   situations do not necessarily mean stable or declining prices.   Producers have raised prices of rubber products substantially,   although "quietly." In another example, paper prices are expected to   average 5 to 7 percent higher this year, followed by another 6   percent rise in 1977, despite ample capacity.
Large retailers indicate that sales were stronger in most   departments in August. Apparel and fashion goods sales continue   below forecasts, however. Retailers' inventories are judged to be   fairly well-balanced because of cautious ordering policies. Sales   are expected to rise further in the months ahead.
Sales of major appliances are below expectations with freezers far   below last years Sales of "built-ins" going to individual remodeling   projects as well as to new construction are quite strong.
Retailers and other suppliers of consumer wants comment that luxury   products are in strongest demand, a phenomenon noted throughout the   recession. Airline travel measured by passenger miles has been about   10 percent above last year in recent months with all of the gain in   pleasure travel. Flights to Hawaii are virtually filled.
Sales of autos and other vehicles to consumers have continued at an   excellent pace. As many dealers exhausted their supplies of large   cars, sales of small cars, including imports, were stimulated. Some   small cars have been sold at cut-rate prices, especially certain   1975 models still on hand after two years. Inventories of new models   are less ample than a year ago and production is being pushed hard   with Saturday work typical. General Motors is anxious to "get a   reading" on public acceptance of its new lines of lighter, shorter "big cars." Chicago area sales will be watched as a bellwether for   the nation.
Light truck sales have been at record levels for some months with a   large share going to consumers. Sales of medium (10,000 to 26,000   pounds), have remained slow. Sales of heavy trucks have increased,   but not as much as expected, and advanced production schedules may   have to be pared back. A producer of diesel engines is operating at   all-time high levels, and wonders if orders for truck engines will   be maintained, Meanwhile, sales of diesels for construction   equipment and industrial uses have not increased significantly.
Most producers of equipment report that demand has improved, but   very gradually and the picture is "spotty." In general, it is the "early movers"-smaller equipment and components such as controls and   smaller electric motorsâ€”that have showed the largest gains with the "laggers," including most types of heavy equipment, still slow. A   producer of heavy industrial cranes and large mining shovels reports   that order backlogs are eroding rapidly and production may be   reduced from current record levels in the months ahead. Machine tool   builders have been pleased with recent increases in orders and   expect substantial additional orders to be placed during or after   the 10-day biennial machine tool show now being held in Chicago   (September 10-17).
Stocks of all types of petroleum products are ample. One forecast of   the rise in total sales this year has been reduced from 6 to 4.5   percent, mostly because vacation driving has been less than   anticipated. A "normal" winter or worse could mean some problems   with availability of fuel oil, and, also, further curtailments of   natural gas. OPEC nations are now expected to increase crude oil   prices by 15 percent at yearend, double the rise expected earlier,   mainly because of stronger than expected demand outside the U.S.
Lead times on cold-rolled steel and galvanized sheets have been cut   by half since late spring. One forecast of steel shipments for 1976   has been reduced from 98 to 96 million tons because user inventories   are not being increased as expected, not because consumption is less   than expected. Local analysts point to a change in steel order   patterns with "reservation planning" by large users over a longer   horizon.
