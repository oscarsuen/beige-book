In the Twelfth District the economy is continuing its moderate rate   of expansion. Consumers remain the major source of demand and   business spending is cautious. After a mid-summer pause, retail   sales have resumed their steady growth. Automobile sales of the   larger domestic models are particularly good. Home-building activity   is increasing, and the demand for forest products has improved. In   most agricultural areas of the District, production has been good,   but there is concern about the effect of declines in prices on farm   income. Bankers report steady demand for consumer and real estate   credit but little strength in commercial loan demand.
Retail sales appear to have resumed their climb after a pause in   June and July and are running at 10 to 15 percent above the same   period a year ago. The greatest strength has been in nondurables.   Customer acceptance of back-to-school sales and fall lines has been   described as good. Retailers are generally optimistic about   prospects for the rest of the year, but they are being careful in   building inventories. Consumer durables are relatively weak and   large-ticket items are moving slowly in most areas. The Western   tourist industry has experienced an excellent summer. In Oregon,   tourist expenditures are up 10 percent over last year.
Automobile sales have been strong through August. Domestic large   models have been selling well; so that by the end of the month, many   dealers had sold out some lines. Domestic economy car sales have   been weak. The market for foreign cars has been mixed, but sales   have jumped in the last month.
Home-building activity is increasing in many areas. Reports from   Southern California and Utah indicate good demand for new homes. The   market for existing homes is also strong. This activity in housing   has stimulated more retail sales by lumber dealers; plywood orders   have increased and some building materials are in short supply. With   this recovery in domestic construction and foreign orders   increasing, the forest products industry is expanding production.   Another indicator of the improved demand for housing is that many of   our banking directors report increased loan demand for mortgage and   for construction financing. These indications of a strengthening   order pattern support expectations of a stronger upward trend in   construction by the end of the year.
Agriculture production in most parts of the District has been good.   Fruit crops in Oregon and Washington have escaped serious weather   damage and are of excellent quality. Rain and :cool weather have   hurt wheat in Eastern Washington, but in Oregon yields are expected   to be high. Drought has caused serious problems for California   ranchers but heavy reliance upon irrigation has limited losses of   most field crops so that the overall impact on State agriculture has   been small. Prospects for farm income, on the other hand, are less   promising; and concern exists over declining or low prices for dairy   products, cattle and many vegetables. Nonetheless, banks in   agricultural areas report steady demand for loans to expand storage   capacity and to buy new equipment.
In California, recent Federal legislation has allowed increased   production and drilling for oil in the Elk Hills reserve. This is   the largest reserve left in the United States except for Alaska.   Production is expected to reach 300,000 barrels a day by 1980, and   refinery capacity in the Bakersfield area is being expanded.
District banks are reporting a steady increase in loans for real   estate and consumer credit. A large California bank describes the   demand for credit from overseas as being firm. The demand for   commercial and industrial loans, particularly in national accounts,   remains flat. According to one large bank, "The crucial reason for   soft demand from the largest companies is their inability to foresee   an adequate return on new investmentâ€”and they have adequate cash   from (a) rising long-term money and (b) current profits." In   contrast, loan demand by smaller businesses and homebuilders is   relatively strong.
