The economy continues to recover smartly, according to Second   District Directors and other business leaders who were contacted   recently. Significant further growth in GNP is expected over the   coming year; consumer spending for the most part remains buoyant;   residential construction is beginning to recover in the District;   and there continue to be expectations of a turnaround in capital   goods outlays. Nevertheless, some apprehensions have been voiced   about potential future shortages of steel and other metals. Against   this background, prices are expected to begin rising more rapidly   and forthcoming wage negotiations to result in substantial   settlements.
All of the respondents expressing an opinion on the subject felt   that a brisk economic recovery would be sustained over the balance   of the year. Several noted that the economy had performed better   during the first quarter than they had expected. Among others, the   chairman of a multinational chemical corporation expected the   upswing to continue to gather strength from greater than anticipated   consumer demand. A Director associated with the automotive industry   reported that, on the basis of recent domestic auto sales, he had   raised his expectations for real GNP growth for 1976 from 6 to 7   percent. The president of a large metal producing firm reported that   demand for metals was increasing somewhat faster than had been   expected earlier.
The latest survey of the Buffalo Purchasing Management Association   points to further significant improvement in the demand for locally   produced goods, with virtually all respondents reporting a steady or   increased flow of new orders, and nearly half reporting an   improvement in the volume of new orders, as compared to only 13   percent so reporting a year ago.
As in previous months, consumer spending generally continued to be   characterized as strong. The Buffalo Branch Directors reported that   retail sales over the Easter shopping period had been "very strong,"   and good gains were also posted in suburban areas of the New York   City region. Some slowing in early May in the rate of growth of   department store sales in the Buffalo area as compared to last year   was noted, but this was attributed in good part to the spurt in   consumer outlays during the comparable period last year under the   impact of the tax rebates. In any event, this softening was not   apparent in the Rochester area. Moreover, a number of respondents   reported the demand for automobiles in upstate New York continuing   very strong, with some dealers having depleted inventories of   certain models. The retail sales picture in New York City, however,   was less favorable. April sales of large city department stores,  notwithstanding the later Easter this year, registered a   disappointing advance of only 3.3 percent from the year-earlier   levelâ€”less than the rise in general merchandise prices.
While retail sales and the more recent rebuilding of business   inventories continued to provide the main thrust to the recovery,   there were further indications that the hitherto lagging capital   investment and residential construction sectors might be picking up.   A financial economist thus felt that even the 4 percent increase in   real business plant and equipment spending in 1976 implied by the   latest McGraw-Hill survey was too low. In his view, a rise of nearly   6 percent was probably more appropriate. Several other financial   economists reiterated their expectations that capital outlays would   pick up as the recovery proceeded. The residential construction   picture continues to brighten in most parts of the District, with   the notable exception of New York City. An official of a New York   State thrift trade association reported that mortgage money was in   substantially greater availability than last fall, and that even 90   percent mortgages were now being made in certain suburban areas   surrounding New York City and Buffalo. The Buffalo Branch Directors   reported that there was clear evidence of an upswing in housing   construction in western New York. The improvement has been   particularly apparent in prime suburban areas, but has also been   evident in the low-to-moderate priced residential sector. Apartment   construction remains in the doldrums, however, under the influence   of high vacancy rates in some areas.
Regarding the price outlook, the official of the chemical concern   mentioned above expected the rate of increase in wholesale prices to   approach a 7-8 percent range by year-end, and expressed concern over   the prospects of shortages in steel and certain other metals. The   latter concern was also expressed by some other respondents. A   Director noted the sharp increase in metals prices which he felt   might reflect some speculation, but also the fact that in his view   profit margins remain very low in most basic commodities. A Director   associated with agriculture stated that he was not as optimistic as   the Department of Agriculture regarding the 1976 grain harvest and   that, in his opinion, higher grain prices are in the offing.
Another Director expressed the view that it appeared unlikely that   the underlying rate of inflation could be kept down below 6 percent   given the present state of consumer demand, fiscal policies, and of   wage pressures. In the latter context, a number of Directors   expected fairly strong wage demands from organized labor, with   first-year settlements ranging from 8 to 10 percent in union   contracts and with non-union wage increases lagging only slightly   behind.
