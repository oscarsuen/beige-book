Consumer spending continues strong except for small cars. One   Director noted continued strong consumer demand for household   materials for remodeling, and a banker Director described retail   sales and installment lending as extremely good. Delinquencies are   the lowest on record, repayments are strong, and consumers show no   reluctance to incur debt. The sharp rise in appliance production in   recent months has been an important factor in the recent surge in   steel orders. Recovery in consumer goods, however, is not without   some weak spots. A major producer of TV tubes reports that while   orders have been picking up they are still well below the peak of   late 1973. Also, operations at the GMC assembly plant at Lordstown,   Ohio remain curtailed because of excessive inventories of Vegas.
The primary metals industry, which has lagged the overall recovery   is rebounding strongly. Operating rates in steel, which late last   year and early this year hovered around 70 percent, are now at about   90 percent of capacity. The surge in steel demand, however, is   confined largely to flat rolled products. Hedge buying against price   increases, coupled with strong demand from automotive and appliance   producers, ballooned orders this quarter, but some steel sources   expect orders next quarter will subside. One steel producer is   allocating orders for some sheet steel because of tight demand and   curtailed output stemming from relining of blast furnaces. Delivery   time on flat roll products has lengthened from 1 month to 3 or 4   months. Demand for structural steel and plates and other products   consumed by capital goods producers remains relatively weak and is   not expected to pick up until the fourth quarter. Orders for   aluminum also have been rising recently in response to higher demand   from automotive and packaging industries. The industry is operating   at about 75 percent of capacity, but steady improvement is expected   throughout the year.
The capital goods sector is showing signs of a comeback. A variety   of producers report a revival in orders from depressed levels in   early 1975. Heavy-duty truck orders spurted between the fourth   quarter 1975 trough and March 1976, although the March level was 60   percent of the peak in early 1975. Demand for bearings has increased   in recent weeks, reversing a declining trend in orders that lasted   into the early months of this year. One of the nation's largest   producers of machine tools reports orders in the first 4 months of   1976 rose 40 percent from a year earlier and exceeded shipments for   the first time in the last 18 months. An economist with a machine   tool builder doubts the 13 percent increase in capital spending   projected in the McGraw-Hill survey. According to him, time is   running out for 1976 delivery. Additionally, the spring survey in   recent years has been about 5 to 7 percent above actual spending.
Tightening supply conditions are noted by several nondurable goods   producers in the District, especially the paperboard, plastics and   chemical products, and glass containers industries. Operations have   been boosted to 90 percent of capacity or higher for these   industries. Delivery schedules have tightened, but shortages have   not yet appeared. According to one source, shortages are not likely   to appear in paperboard and glass containers until capacity reaches   about 95 percent. Demand for plastics has boosted operations in   recent months close to the pre-recession peak. A petrochemical   producer reports that some of the industry's capacity has been lost   because of environmental restrictions.
A flurry of price increases has accompanied strengthening in   markets. Prices for flat roll steel products will rise in June and   apparently some bar mill products are likely to increase, according   to one steel economist. Industry sources justify price increases   because of the high cost of additional capacity. A major bearings   producer announces a large price increase effective May, and   aluminum ingot prices are scheduled to rise about 6 percent early in   June. Several nondurable goods firms also report actual or   anticipated price increases for their products in order to finance   additional capacity. A plastics producer expects a 10 percent   increase in polypropylene this fall to support its new plant that   will double capacity by late 1977. Another source speculates that   paperboard prices are likely to rise in the third quarter.
Effects of the rubber industry strike, according to an economist   with a major tire producer, may be less widespread than generally   reported. He said 35 to 40 percent of the industry is still affected   by the strike. He expects that the auto industry will attempt to   adjust for the strike by eliminating spare tires in new trucks and   cars, accepting tires that were previously considered blemished,   upgrading tire quality, and increasing imports wherever possible.
Savings and loans generally report deposit inflows are stronger than   loan demand. At least two large associations no longer offer savings   certificates yielding 7-1/4 and 7-3/4 percent, and two others have   extended maturities on 7-3/4 percent certificates to 8 years. One   large association lengthened the maturity on 4 and 6 year   certificates to 10 years. As a result, net savings deposits have   declined since mid-April. Loans for multi-family housing remain   weak, and mortgage rates have eased to around 8 1/2 percent for a 70   percent loan although one association with a variable rate mortgage   lowered its rates to 8 1/4 percent. There is no indication of any   reduction in the passbook rate, although financial officers of   several associations are eager for such action.
