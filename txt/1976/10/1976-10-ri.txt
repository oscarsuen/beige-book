Responses to our October survey of Fifth District business   conditions suggest continued sluggishness in demand at both the   retail and the manufacturing levels. Although shipments by District   manufacturers increased in September, the volume of new orders   remained soft and backlogs of orders declined somewhat.   Manufacturers' inventories are still apparently above desired   levels, although stocks of materials declined slightly.   Manufacturers' responses showed the first signs of weakness in   employment since spring. Retailers reported sales as steady but with   big ticket items continuing to move slowly. Inventories at retail   continued to expand in September. There is some evidence that price   pressures may be abating. Increases were less widespread in   September than in most recent months and respondents in a follow-up   to our regular survey cited relatively low capacity utilization,   growing inventories, and continuing weakness of demand as reasons to   expect greater price stability over the next three to six months   than in the recent past. With only a few isolated exceptions   respondents anticipate no difficulties in obtaining supplies or in   meeting orders. In line with recent developments in business   conditions, there seems to have been some downward revision of   respondents' expectations for the level of activity over the next   six months, although the general tone of those expectations remains   positive.
Of manufacturers responding to our latest survey, over one-third   report an increase in the level of shipments during September and   nearly one-half noted no change from August. With respect to the   volume of new orders, however, only 28 percent reported increases,   slightly fewer than reported declines. Over 20 percent indicated   declines in employment and a comparable number reported reduced   weekly hours. Despite virtually no change in finished goods   inventories and a slight decline in stocks of materials, the   proportion of manufacturers viewing current inventory levels as   excessive was somewhat larger this month than last. The view that   current plant and equipment capacity is excessive remains widely   held but few respondents indicate any inclination to alter current   expansion plans. The fraction of manufacturing respondents expecting   business to improve over the next six months declined slightly in   our latest survey but about 45 percent still expect some   improvement, while another 45 percent expect the general level of   business to remain unchanged.
Among individual industries, producers of consumer goods,   particularly apparel and furniture, seem to have accounted for much   of the slowing in activity. Primary metals producers also apparently   have experienced some slowdown, but producers of machinery and   equipment, electrical equipment, and chemicals continue to report   some improvement.
At the retail level respondents once again noted a weakening in   sales of big ticket items but overall sales apparently held at   almost the August level. Inventories expanded further in September   and remain somewhat above desired levels. Retail price increases   were also less widespread than in recent months.
Responding to a brief follow-up survey concerning price   expectations, a small sample of our respondents expressed general   agreement that prices should show little change or remain flat over   the short-term future. Such reasons as generally soft demand, the   failure of earlier optimistic expectations to be met, stability of   materials costs, and growing inventories in many sectors were cited   as explanations for this view. One respondent expressed great   hesitancy to comment on the future of prices because of what he   called a most confused market, with prices for some lines remaining   quite strong and others showing considerable weakness.
Our survey of District banks suggests some healthy increases in   loans over the past month, particularly business loans but also in   the consumer and real estate areas. Much of the strength in business   loans seems to have originated among wholesalers, commodity dealers,   and public utilities.
With the sharp decline in crop receipts through the first seven   months of the year, the District's total cash farm income has   registered only a slight increase over a year earlier. But with the   marketing of the fall-harvested crops, this situation could improve   significantly. Both soybean and cotton prices are higher than last   year, while flue-cured tobacco prices are at record levels, 14   percent above a year ago.
