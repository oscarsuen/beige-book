The continuing improvement in economic conditions in the Second   District appears to have been sustained in the face of the apparent   slowing in the pace of the nationwide recovery, judging from   comments of directors and other business leaders who were contacted   recently. The strengthening in retail sales in New York City has   carried into early October and appears to have spread into other   parts of the region. While capital spending continued to lag, there   are scattered reports of a pickup. The rate of joblessness in the   region appears to have stabilized and the gap between the regional   and national unemployment rates has narrowed. On the outlook for   prices, respondents generally felt that inflation was moderating   gradually and that the recent resistance to attempted price   increases would help temper the future inflation. Nonetheless, many   remained concerned over the prospects of mounting cost pressures.
Consumer spending in New York City appears to have retained its new-found strength. While for most of the year, New York City   merchandising has been a weak spot for many national retail chains,   that situation seems to have changed in recent months. The vice   president of a national department store chain reported that the   increase in September sales for New York exceeded that chain-wide   average and that, while sales in the rest of the country showed   signs of a weakening in early October, sales in New York City   remained strong. According to a City department store executive,   sales were strong in September and were better than expected in   early October. The pickup in consumer buying appears to have spread   outside of New York City as well. The directors of the Buffalo   Branch detected a modest improvement in department store sales in   September. Part of this impetus in the recovery in consumer buying   may have been due to growing acceptance of Sunday openings. The head   of a large department store chain in the Buffalo area noted a marked   improvement in sales of the final weeks of September, which he   attributed to the success of recent Sunday openings. He expects   Sunday openings to become a way of life in the Buffalo area. In New   Jersey, a trade association official noted that, although new car   sales continued to be more sluggish than nationwide, automobile   dealers were generally optimistic about the future. He also   commented that sales apparently had been unaffected by the Ford   strike.
Capital spending in the District continues to lag, but there has   been scattered evidence of a pickup. The president of a company   producing petroleum and building equipment expected his firm's   capital outlays, which were up 50 percent this year, to double next   year.. The president of a manufacturing company was also optimistic   concerning plans to augment capacity, stating that his firm would be   emphasizing machinery and tools rather than additions to plant. On   the other hand, the vice president of a mining concern did not feel   that his company would increase capital spending before early 1977,   and the president of a maritime corporation stated that his company   planned to purchase fewer new ships this year than usual.
Production of capital goods in the District continues to lag. A   national manufacturer of industrial machinery announced a 2 percent   reduction in its work force. At the same time, a major steel   producer in western New York announced layoff plans in conjunction   with the closing of relatively inefficient blast furnace facilities.   Directors of the Buffalo Branch, however, expected the near-term   prospects for new orders, production, and employment in steel and   other heavy industries in western New York to be strong. One   director, whose firm is a major purchaser of steel, contended that   press reports were misleading in conveying the impression that   recent cutbacks in steel production reflected weak demand. Rather,  in his view, they were primarily attributable to a spreading out of   existing orders to achieve more efficient production.
While the recovery in the region's economy since the trough of the   recession has still not matched the national recovery, there have   been some encouraging signs in the employment situation of late. The   seasonally adjusted unemployment rates of both New York City and   State held steady from June to August despite an increase in the   national rate. Furthermore, in recent months the slide in the City's   private employment appears to be coming to a halt. Indeed, for the   New York-New Jersey metropolitan area, private employment increased   in July for the first gain in almost three years.
On the outlook for price increases, a majority of respondents   expected inflation to diminish slowly in coming months. The   president of a national retail store chain thought the recent   sluggishness of the economy would have a moderating influence on   pricesâ€”both materials prices and product prices. Consistent with   this view, the chief economist for a paper company stated that   prices of his firm's products had "softened" recently, and the vice   president of a company dealing in minerals said that demand   conditions had not allowed cost increases to be passed on. The   chairman of a major New York City bank felt that the recent   resistance to attempted price increases was encouraging and a   healthy development in helping to assure the continuation of the   economic expansion. Other respondents echoed this view and generally   felt that there was little danger of a return to double-digit   inflation. The president of an international oil firm expected   industrial prices to increase 5 to 6 percent over the coming year.   The Buffalo directors expected prices of industrial materials to   rise about 6 to 8 percent during the next six to nine months.
Although there was a consensus that inflation was likely to   diminish, strong cost pressures remained a matter of concern to a   number of respondents. One director expected major wage settlements   to continue in the neighborhood of 10 percent. A senior economist of   a major manufacturer also thought that the momentum for large wage   increases still remained. Indeed, he felt that wage increases might   become larger as certain groups of workers sought to regain their   relative positions in the wage structure. Because this economist   felt that the bulk of cyclical productivity gains had been   exhausted, he expected upward pressures on prices to remain strong,   with prices rising by a minimum of 6 percent in 1977. On the other   hand, the president of a major chemical firm anticipated that   employees would become less aggressive in their wage demands. As a   result, wage settlements would moderate slightly, perhaps to a rate   of 8-1/2 percent. An investment banking economist felt that price   expectations would wind down, causing wage pressures to moderate.   The president of a retail store gave another reason for wage   moderation. He expected that businessmen would toughen their   bargaining stances as they experienced difficulty in raising prices.
