The economic recovery in the Eleventh District has settled back to a   lackluster pace. The growth in total employment has been relatively   flat since June, and with a faster rate of growth in the civilian   labor force, the unemployment rate has increased to 6.6 percent-the   second highest level this year. Industrial production in Texas   continues to edge up, but largely because increases in drilling and   crude oil production are offsetting declines in manufacturing.   According to this month's survey, residential construction remains   strong, and the prospects for commercial building next year have   brightened. Curtailments in natural gas supplies this winter should   not seriously affect economic activity, and the demand for   agricultural loans has strengthened as farmers defer marketing grain   in anticipation of higher prices.
Residential construction in the District continues to be strong, and   a majority of the home builders surveyed expressed optimism about   the overall outlook in coming months. Housing starts in Texas are at   the second highest level this year, and construction employment rose   by 700 workers in August. Residential builders in Dallas and Houston   report that they are actively recruiting labor from outside the   state. Most respondents feel that employment prospects in the   industry will continue to show improvement.
Most of the home builders surveyed think that sales of single-family   homes are good. An El Paso contractor reports that sales are "unbelievable" and that his only problem is a shortage of lots. The   prices of most homes are rising moderately as demand strengthens and   construction costs climb. Most respondents believe housing   inventories are about normal for this time of the year. In Houston,   however, a recent study indicates that the inventory of completed   but unsold homes in that city is growing, as sales have begun to lag   behind new housing starts. Texas home builders familiar with the   recent housing lotteries in Southern California do not see any   prospect for lottery sales here. They cite the greater availability   of land for development and a larger number of home builders   supplying the Texas housing market as primary reasons why the demand   for new homes can be met fairly easily.
Multiple-family construction in the Eleventh District is improving   slowly. Apartment occupancy rates in major Texas cities are high,   ranging from roughly 90 percent in Dallas to 96 percent in El Paso.   The majority of the apartment builders surveyed indicate that the   current level of rents is not providing them with the incentive to   build at a faster pace. They report that the fast rise in utility   rates and their general inability, due to lease arrangements, to   pass these rate increases on to tenants quickly is a major   constraint on the expansion of apartments. A Dallas builder also   feels that the recently enacted tax reform bill could further dampen   the incentive to build new apartment units.
Commercial building continues to be the weakest area of   construction. A commercial builder in Dallas reports that   construction financing will likely be tight the remainder of this   year and that some new form of interim financing is necessary to   stimulate industry growth. Almost all the commercial builders   surveyed are optimistic about the prospects for increased   construction activity next year.
A survey of mobile home manufacturers and dealers found that current   sales are being hampered by stringent financing terms. All   respondents cited a need for lower down payments and longer-term   financing. Dealers in Houston, who are familiar with the new   Veterans Administration financing program for mobile homes, indicate   they feel the program will not significantly improve sales. Another   Houston dealer cites a general unwillingness to handle Veterans   Administration loans because of the large amount of paperwork and   the long lead time necessary for approval of loan applications.
The outlook for natural gas supplies in the District states this   winter is mixed. Louisiana, New Mexico, and Arizona may have   curtailments in natural gas supplies much larger than the estimated   22 percent cutback that may be experienced nationwide. Curtailments   in Texas and Oklahoma, however, are likely to be smaller than the   national average. A survey of state utility agencies indicates that   none of the states is expecting curtailments to significantly   interfere with economic activity. Alternative fuels, such as   distillate and residual fuel oils, should be readily available and   can carry most industries for short periods of time.
Although higher production costs and increased farming and ranching   activity have increased the demand for credit, most country bankers   in the District report adequate funds available for agricultural   loans. Deposits at commercial banks have increased substantially in   the past year, and lower yields on alternative investment have   released funds for farm and ranch credit. Moreover, correspondent   lending activity can be further increased as loan demand at large   urban banks is not growing as fast as it is at rural banks. And   country bankers are still selling substantial amounts of Federal   funds. However, a few agribankers, particularly in the large wheat   producing areas of Texas, report very high loan-to-deposit ratios.   Repayment of loans has slowed, and many loans have been extended as   farmers have withheld wheat from the market waiting for higher   prices.
