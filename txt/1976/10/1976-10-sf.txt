Our directors continue to report moderate economic growth but   undertones of growing pessimism are discernible. The trend in   consumer spending has been erratic resulting in uncertainty about   the strength of holiday season sales. Demand for basic metals such   as steel and aluminum has weakened more than could be ascribed to   strike activity. The lumber and plywood industry is meeting   expectations for a prosperous year, but there is a heavy overhang of   pulp causing a lowering of sights for that industry. On the other   hand, there has been a decided pickup in sales of commercial   aircraft. Adverse weather and low water inventory in some areas have   impeded crop production, but the more widespread condition is one of   over-supply with selling prices, and consequently incomes,   declining.
Retailers in the District have become apprehensive over the recent   saw-toothed behavior of sales and are following a very cautious   inventory policy. It is generally believed that consumers are in the   process of adjusting their consumption patterns to more modest rates   as opposed to the higher growth rates of 1975 which were caused by   recession-related, pent-up demand. No unseasonable spurt in holiday   spending is anticipated. Nondurable goods sales, especially, are   expected to be flat, as indicated by a declining trend in new orders   for apparel. Early data indicate that 1977 automobile models have   been well-received, but the strike at Ford Motor Co. made analysis   more difficult than usual. In agricultural areas, lower anticipated   incomes are expected to result in lower retail sales of all consumer   goods.
New orders for aircraft have exceeded expectations this year and   manufacturers feel that the industry has turned a corner.   Replacement demand f or commercial aircraft is expected to be heavy   through 1981 leading one large producer to consider introducing a   whole new family of jets. At Boeing, an order for 28 aircraft by   United Airlines (largest aircraft order since 1968) has raised   earlier forecasts of 1976 sales by 70 percent in dollar terms. The   aerospace industry as a whole is leveling out and improvement is   expected next year. Government defense bids are now out on 10   projects valued at $10 billion.
Demand for basic metals has slipped in recent months and is   reflected in shorter lead time on procurements, special discounts   and lower aluminum scrap prices. The rate of increase in the cost of   purchased materials is slowing up and indicating greater   availability of supplies. In contrast, the large overhang of copper   inventory has been reduced and production is picking up. One   director reports a definite lull in demand over the past two months   for steel and aluminum products as well as chemical coatings,   polyester and associated resin products that is not entirely related   to the automobile and rubber workers' strikes.
Within the forest products industry, activity in lumber and plywood   has been strong, meeting earlier expectations of a prosperous year,   whereas, forecasts for the paper industry have had to be scaled   down. "The pulp overhang in the world is the largest that it has   ever been." Operating rates have been flat to declining from the   pace of the first half of 1976 and no pickup is expected over the   next few quarters.
News from the agricultural front is uniformly gloomy . Prices are   low for both crops and cattle and one reporter states that, "This   slump in agriculture could last for a year or two," because of over-production in a long list of commodities. The price of wheat   declined by $1.00 a bushel over the past month. Potatoes are being   ploughed under because the price has slipped to 90 cents per cwt.   Farmers are finding this situation difficult to understand in the   face of the recent European drought.
Machinery and equipment sales to agricultural areas are expected to   decline. Spurts in capital investment are usually made in years of   high income in order to take advantage of tax shelters in the form   of fast depreciation as well as the investment tax credit.
Erratic rainfall and low water inventories have been disruptive to   farmers all year. The content of sugar in the sugar beets is down   because of the weather. Heavy rain hampered harvesting of beans,   caused the third cutting of hay to be low in quality and destroyed   approximately 50 percent of the California raisin crop. Water   restriction (15 percent in the San Joaquin Valley) caused a great   deal of crop diversion, such as from alfalfa to cotton. All agree   that the situation will worsen considerably in 1977 unless there is   adequate rain and a heavy snow pack this winter.
