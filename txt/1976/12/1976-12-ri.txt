Our November survey of business conditions suggests a continued   lackluster performance in the Fifth District economy. Responses of   manufacturers surveyed indicate rather distinct softness, with   shipments, new orders, employment and weekly hours all declining   from a month ago. Reports of reduced volumes of new orders   outnumbered reports of increases by better than two to one.   Materials inventories were unchanged while stocks of finished goods   increased somewhat, and remain above desired levels at many firms.   Retail sales apparently showed no change, while sales of big ticket   items relative to total sales weakened slightly. Inventories at   retail were unchanged, but remain above desired levels. Retailers   report no change in prices paid during November, while manufacturers   experienced further increases. Retailers and manufacturers, on the   other hand, received higher prices. Manufacturing respondents expect   improvement in the level of business activity nationally and in   their respective market areas during the next six months, but   retailers are less optimistic, expecting no significant change. Both   groups, however, expect improvements for their own firms. District   farm income improved slightly in September and October and is now   running 5 percent above a year agoâ€”about the same as the increase   for the nation as a whole.
While over one-third of our manufacturing respondents reported new   orders running below a month ago, much of this weakness seems to   have been concentrated in the textile and apparel industries.   Activity in the apparel sector has fallen since early in the year, a   trend which a prominent trade publication attributes to excessive   inventories at the retail level and to higher imports of apparel   products. Whatever the cause, over one-half of textile respondents   experienced a reduced volume of new orders in November and now view   current plant and equipment capacity as excessive. At the same time,   80 percent of apparel industry respondents also experienced lower   volume of orders and feel current capacity is in excess. Some   weakness was also reported in the furniture industry while reports   from chemicals and primary metals producers were mixed.   Manufacturers of electrical machinery and equipment seem to have   done somewhat better in November, at least in terms of new orders.
Lower levels of shipments were also reported by more than one-third   of the manufacturers, while over one-half report reduced backlogs of   orders. Nearly 20 percent experienced increases in materials   inventories, but a like number report reductions. Stocks of finished   goods apparently grew somewhat, although even here nearly 20 percent   of the respondents report declines. In addition, almost one-third   indicate reductions in employment in November and almost as many   operated fewer hours per week. Prices, including employee   compensation, moved up rather broadly, as has been the case in most   recent months. Almost 40 percent of the manufacturers surveyed feel   current inventory levels and current plant and equipment capacity   are excessive and 10 percent now feel current expansion plans should   be cut back.
Among retailers surveyed, sales and inventories showed little change   last month although sales of big ticket items declined slightly in   relative terms. Employment was also unchanged, but employee   compensation rose as did prices received. Prices paid held steady.   Forty percent of our retail respondents view present inventory   levels as excessive, but all say the current number and size of   outlets is about right.
The retailers are unanimous in expecting the level of business   activity nationally and in their respective market areas to remain   unchanged over the next six months, but 40 percent expect some   improvement in the level of sales of their own firms over that time   period. One-half of the manufacturers, on the other hand, expect   improvement in each of these areas.
Results of a recent survey of district banks failed to yield a   clear-cut picture of business loan demand. The borrowing needs of   business are increasing moderately, with both   short-term and long-term demands represented. It is clear, however, that borrowers are   leaning toward longer maturity, fixed rate loans, and that lenders   are resisting this movement.
Record high prices on all flue-cured tobacco belts highlighted the   1976 marketing season. With prices averaging 11 percent higher than   in 1975 and quality of offerings better on the eastern North   Carolina and border belt markets, the total value of sales was up   about 5 percent even though volume of marketings was down. Reports   from South Carolina indicate that farmers are still holding free   cotton and that some are asking 80 cents per pound.
