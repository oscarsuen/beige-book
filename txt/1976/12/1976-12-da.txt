Most regional economic indicators point to further strength in the   Southwest economy. Business loan demand at large District banks,   however, is expected to continue weak, with further downward   pressure on interest rates. Oil and gas production continues to   decline, but drilling activity and employment and income in the   industry continue to rise. Demand for labor continues to grow.   Unemployment is declining, and the unemployment rate for the five   states of the Eleventh District is down to 6.0 percent. A recovery   in construction activity appears to be taking hold in multifamily   housing and nonresidential building. A survey of department stores   found Christmas sales to be strong, and auto dealers reported   further growth in new car sales. Moreover, manufacturing output   should continue to grow at a moderate rate next year.
Department store sales are showing strong improvement. Almost all   retailers interviewed are optimistic about the prospects for robust   Christmas sales, and early indications seem to support their   optimism. Only at stores in border cities that cater to Mexican   nationals is business off substantially. Sales of both hard goods   and soft goods are reported to be strong. High-priced merchandise is   moving extremely well. Retail inventories are at desired levels and   in line with the anticipated volume of Christmas sales. A major   Dallas retailer stated that his inventories are at their best level   in three years. A director with a large nationwide group of   department stores reported a very conservative outlook for first   quarter 1977 with improvement in the second quarter.
Automobile sales in the District are up moderately, but sales in   Houston are at the highest level in three years. Demand for small   cars remains weak, while sales of intermediate- and full-size cars   continue to strengthen. Also, fleet demand remains strong, and sales   of vans, trucks, and jeeps are brisk. GM and AMC dealers indicate   that the rebate programs on subcompact models increased sales only   marginally. Dealer inventories of full- and intermediate-size models   are low, while stocks of small cars remain high. But nearly all   dealers report that inventories are gradually being brought into   balance. Some Houston dealers, however, cite overall inventory   levels are 30 to 50 percent lower than they would like.
Manufacturing output in Texas continues to increase in most major   industries. However, output of petroleum refining; paper products;   and stone, clay, and glass products has weakened. A Houston   economist notes that durable goods production has been gaining   momentum in that area. And coupled with the high level of output of   nondurables, further gains in production should stimulate increased   capital spending in a few months.
The future increase in production by the Southwest's largest   industrial complex, petroleum refining and chemicals, could be   influenced by the anticipated price increase by OPEC. Most observers   expect an increase of 10 percent, which would lead to a one cent a   gallon increase in gasoline prices. However, there are differences   on the anticipated timing of the price hike. Some respondents expect   no immediate increase in oil prices but felt the increase would   certainly be imposed in the next six months. In any case, output by   the complex is expected to rise next year and may push existing   production capacity in some product lines.
Recovering from a slump earlier this year, the number of active oil   drilling rigs in Texas has risen to the highest level in 17 years.   Despite the high level of drilling activity, production of oil field   equipment has weakened. New orders have fallen as drilling   contractors, faced with higher equipment prices and increased   financing problems, are content to work their current inventory of   rigs more intensively. As a result, production of oil field   equipment next year probably will be geared largely to the   replacement of older equipment.
Production of primary metals is rising on relatively strong demand   for aluminum. Demand for steel and copper remains weak. Output of   steel, however, is expected to increase by next spring, but copper   production will remain little changed for most of next year.   Moreover, a high level of copper inventories will have to be run   down before production can be stepped up. Aluminum producers see a   gradual increase in product prices, while a Fort Worth steelmaker   expects prices of ferrous metals to remain soft. Another steel   producer thought the recently announced 6-percent increase in prices   for sheet steel would not hold.
The recovery in construction activity is beginning to spur the   demand for lumber in Texas. Current inventory levels of lumber range   from "adequate to low." And lumber prices have climbed to the high   levels that prevailed four years ago, according to a lumber   brokerage firm. A Houston company anticipates that the demand and   prices for lumber will continue to move up in the next six months.
In mining, production of oil and gas continues to decline, but   drilling activity has rebounded sharply from a low last June.   Drilling in Texas has surpassed the peak level of output attained a   year ago. In uranium mining, one District state—an important   producer—is considering a large increase of its tax on "yellow   cake."
Grain sorghum prices have fallen substantially in recent months. And   in response to lower feed costs, the number of cattle placed on feed   is up in the District's major feeding areas. Pressured between high   production costs and low prices, grain farmers are reported to be "in trouble" and may press vigorously for higher price supports.
