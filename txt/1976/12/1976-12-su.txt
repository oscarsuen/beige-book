Although many Districts report that activity over the past month has   been sluggish or flat, almost as many report that the lull in   activity is over and an uptrend has been resumed. Consumer spending   is anticipated to be 8 to 10 percent higher this Christmas season   than last although sales will not be this exuberant in agricultural   areas where income gains are low this year. Residential housing has   been picking up momentum over the past three months, generating   capacity operations at lumber mills. There is some doubt as to   whether the recent rash of posted price increases will stick.   Business loan demand remains in the doldrums but inquiries at banks   have picked up. Savings flows at thrift institutions continue to set   new records.
Consumer spending is not expected to be exuberant over the Christmas   season, nor is it expected to flag greatly. Gains over the last year   on the order of 8 to 10 percent are anticipated depending on the   amount of promotional effort expended. A larger proportion of sales   this year involve the use of credit. As reported by Minneapolis,   Richmond and Kansas City, spending is less buoyant in agricultural   areas where income is running about 5 percent over last year.   Inventories of big-ticket appliances continue to be high in the   Northeast. Sales of large cars and intermediates are very strong but   many reports state that the rebate program was unsuccessful in   moving subcompacts. The Dallas District is experiencing more robust   Christmas sales than elsewhere.
The coldest winter in 80 years is draining fuel supplies in the   Midwest and, in some cases, raising home heating bills by 35 to 40   percent over last year. Observers in the oil industry in Dallas   expect an OPEC price increase of 10 percent which would lead to a   one cent per gallon increase in gasoline prices.
Although the most recent indicators of industrial new orders,   employment and the workweek are down, this trend is generally   regarded as a lull and is not expected to continue. There is some   feeling that capital spending plans are being held up in   anticipation of an investment tax credit and other possible changes   from the new administration. The strength of residential   construction reported by Dallas and San Francisco is already causing   tight supply situations for lumber and gypsum in those areas.   According to Cleveland, steel economists have reduced their   forecasts of domestic steel shipments for 1977 from 105 million tons   to about 100 million tons, compared with an estimated 89 million   tons in 1976. Moreover, both the textile and apparel industries are   reported by Richmond to be experiencing declining activity and   capacity is regarded as excessive. The factors responsible are   excessive inventories and higher imports of apparel.
It is unclear whether recent posted price increases for a wide range   of basic materials such as flat-rolled steel, aluminum sheeting,   chlorine and chlorine solvents and synthetic textiles will hold in   today's markets. Some of these increases were unexpected and are   being attributed to fear of the imposition of price controls.   Although the consensus appears to be that these increases will   stick, discounting seems to be a widespread practice.
In agriculture, livestock feeding operations continue to be   unprofitable and some crops such as cotton had a below-normal yield   this year. The winter wheat crop has been planted, but farmers are   very concerned about the low level of soil moisture. Drought seems   to be a real fear this year across much of the nation's farmland.   Spending on new farm equipment and vehicles is down considerably and   loan activity, especially refinancing, is up.
Business loan demand continues sluggish in all Districts. The Boston   District reports that four noted economists interviewed by them   believe that some stimulus is called for to avert an "incipient   recession" and "...provide the strong financial climate for the   strong investment performance which had been hoped for but not yet   materialized." However, some bankers in Philadelphia, Dallas, and   San Francisco have noted an increased number of encouraging   conversations with corporate borrowers regarding additions to plant   and equipment.
