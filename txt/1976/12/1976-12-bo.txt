The Directors of the First District report that the national pause   is curtailing economic activity in New England. "We formerly used   the phrase 'cautious optimism;' now we just use 'cautious.'"   Furthermore, there are no indications that capacity will constrain   growth in the region, since local utilization rates are high only in   the paper and lumber industries. In spite of generally disappointing   business conditions, new orders for machine tools have increased   modestly during recent months and retail sales volumes range from "good" to "excellent."
In the paper industry, the newsprint sector almost always operates   close to 100 percent capacity with Canadian suppliers taking the   fluctuations. Canadian capacity at the present time is adequate,   and, although little expansion is planned, conservation programs   adopted by buyers should prevent shortages in the coming year.   Purchasers of fine papers do not have similar conservation programs   and domestic supply is much more important. However, this sector of   the industry is not generally subject to the fluctuations in demand   that produce shortages.
Retailing is performing very strongly in New England. November was   an excellent month for many stores, and December is running well   ahead of plan so far. Most retailers report that sales have   increased at least 8 to 10 percent over last year during recent   weeks. Officially, the outlook for spring is cautious: there is a   tendency to live "hand-to-mouth" since "nobody predicts far out with   any confidence."
Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, Samuelson, and Tobin were available   for comment this month. Houthakker and Tobin both found the   economy's 1976 performance consistent with what could have been   expected from the monetary policy followed. All expect some further   deceleration in the real growth rate this quarter and little pick-up   in the first quarter of 1977. This decelerating growth trajectory,   Samuelson said, has undermined the animal spirits of investors and   the buoyancy of consumers. Tobin describes the present circumstances   as "incipient recession, ' and Eckstein assigns a 10 percent   probability to an inventory recession. The commendable 6 percent   real growth target is not likely to be achieved, Samuelson points   out, under any of the policies seriously being discussed.
All favor a more stimulative monetary policy although each for   different reasons. Tobin's argument centers primarily on timing and   policy mix issues. He prefers a moderate, temporary fiscal stimulus   combined with a strong, monetary expansion. Given the lagged   impacts, fiscal stimulus can best avert the "incipient recession" and monetary policy can provide the strong financial climate for the   strong investment performance which had been hoped for but has not   yet materialized. This policy prescription stems from his   conservative bias favoring a large investment component and a   balanced federal budget at full employment. He favors a 50 basis   point reduction in the Federal funds rate; if this should violate   the monetary targets, the divergence can be explained as desirable   in view of the state of the economy.
Houthakker finds "monetary policy still on the unnecessarily tight   side." He favors a reduction in the Federal funds rate to 4 percent   to achieve monetary growth near the top (but still within) the   target range. He notes the progress that has been made in reducing   the rates of inflation, expects further progress over the next few   quarters, and sees little risk of a reacceleration so long as   monetary growth remains within the target range.
Samuelson argues policy "should err, if necessary, a little on the   expansionary side because there is still some breathing room."   Despite the revisions in capacity utilization indices, there is   still ample capacity in the aggregate. Admittedly, on a   disaggregated basis, there are very few industries which could be   expected to reach "capacity" before the labor force becomes fully   employed. Good policy, however, does not seek to prevent full   utilization in all industries: to the contrary, the purpose of an   expansion is to put some price and profit pressures on those   industrial sectors where capacity expansion is necessary. To   accompany the fiscal stimulus—which should be shared by   everybody, households and business, taxpayers and nontax-payers—monetary growth should proceed at or above the upper limits of the   target range until the perilous corner has been turned. Once the   system "gets its second wind," monetary growth could be reduced in   order to average within the target range over a period of perhaps a   full year.
To Eckstein, "the situation is clear. The economy needs stimulus.   The burden of stimulus rests on everyone, including the Fed." Short-term rates should be held at or below current levels to accommodate   the fiscal stimulus. Without monetary accommodation, the effects of   fiscal stimulus will be nil or even negative.
