Responses to our latest survey of Fifth District manufacturers   indicate that activity in July remained essentially stable for the   second consecutive month. The pace of improvement appears to have   slowed in the second quarter, and since then there has been little   change in the level of manufacturers' shipments and some softening   in the volume of new orders. Backlogs of orders have declined in   each of the last two months, while materials inventories have   remained essentially unchanged. Stocks of finished goods leveled off   in July, after rising in June, and inventories in general seem to be   somewhat above desired levels. District retailers surveyed report   increased sales in July, but big-ticket items apparently did not   figure in this improvement. Retail inventories showed relatively   little change after three months of widespread increases but remain   above desired levels. Both manufacturing and retail respondents   remain optimistic, expecting further improvement in business   conditions over the next six months. Business loans at large   District banks have shown little, if any, growth in recent weeks.   Real estate loan volume remains essentially flat, while consumer   lending continues to advance. In the agricultural sector, drought   threatens severe crop losses in North Carolina's piedmont and   western coastal plain. Short soil-moisture supplies have also   caused crop conditions to deteriorate in many other areas of the   District.
Manufacturers' responses to our survey reveal a decline in backlogs   of orders during July, resulting from a slight decline in the volume   of new orders accompanied by a small increase in shipments.   Inventories of both materials and finished goods were essentially   unchanged from June, and over one third of manufacturers feel   current levels are too high. Manufacturing employment seems to have   risen somewhat among respondents, although hours worked per week   declined slightly. Most respondents report paying higher prices in   July, but reports of receiving higher prices were less common than   in recent months. One third of our respondents report increased   employee compensation. Thirty percent of the manufacturers   responding to our survey continue to view current plant and   equipment as excessive, although one in ten now considers them   inadequate. There continues to be little desire to enlarge current   expansion plans.
Retailers report increased sales in July, although sales of big-ticket items apparently declined in relative terms. Comments of   retailers suggest a more favorable outlook for fall lines but   continued slack in sales of summer items. The latter are reportedly   selling only at reduced prices. Inventories at retail showed little   change last month and apparently remain somewhat above desired   levels. Prices, paid and received, rose across a broad front.   Retailers remain satisfied with the number and size of their   outlets.
Business loan volume at large District banks has shown little, if   any, growth in recent weeks. Seasonal demand for agriculture-related   loans is also weak. The outlook of area bankers is mixed. While some   foresee no immediate cyclical turnaround for business loans, others   feel the situation is poised for a turnaround in the third or fourth   quarters. One Maryland bank reports a recent nominal increase in   commercial lending, with some interest reported in term borrowing to   finance fixed investment. According to a branch director, however, "there are no signs of inventory accumulation, plant expansion, or   other capital expenditures which are needed to spur demand". For the   time being, loan volume remains below desired levels.
Real estate loan volume at District banks appears essentially flat,   although one Maryland bank reports a moderate increase, primarily in   construction lending. Consumer lending is still advancing, although   at a reduced rate compared with recent months. Area bankers expect   this strength to continue for the present time. The Federal Home   Loan Bank in Atlanta reports continued strong deposit inflows into   District savings and loan associations. The rate of net inflow,   however, has shown recent signs of slowing. The volume of mortgage   loan commitments and closings at savings and loan associations is   exceptionally high but is expected to subside as deposit inflows   slow.
Higher prices than last year, heavier volume, lower but improving   quality of marketings, and a small reduction in the percentage of   sales placed under loan have characterized the 1976 flue-cured   tobacco marketing season thus far. Average prices are currently   running some 8 percent above a year ago. Receipts from farm   marketings continue to run above a year earlier, but the District   increase remains well below that for the nation. The relatively poor   gain recorded in the District is due to a sharp decline in crop   receipts.
There is still no indication of any problems, real or potential,   arising from supply or capacity constraints. Most respondents report   no problems in meeting orders and none in obtaining deliveries from   key suppliers. There remain several who expect some lengthening of   lead time, but nothing out of the ordinary. Only in a few isolated   cases are any difficulties being encountered, and there seems to be   no pattern of industry involvement. In one case, a manufacturer   anticipates difficulty if there is no prompt resolution of the   rubber workers' strike.
