As to the overall outlook for the national economy, a senior economist of a financial firm was highly optimistic, expecting a long-lived recovery and a sharp moderation in inflation. On the other hand, another senior economist expressed apprehension over the danger of a future pickup in real growth with concomitant upward price pressures. An economist of a major business equipment producer looked for deceleration in real growth but anticipated a favorable price performance. With regard to industrial materials prices, the president of a major metals firm felt that, while there would be further increases, a relative "breather" was likely compared with recent previous months. A nonferrous metals economist viewed as likely an additional copper price increase late in the year, with the possibility that the price of aluminum ingots would rise early next year. The Buffalo directors felt that, with substantial agricultural production in prospect, price pressures in this sector would be modest.
