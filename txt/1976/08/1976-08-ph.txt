Economic conditions in the Third District are improving, but the   pace of improvement is somewhat uneven. Retail activity is mixed,   while the manufacturing sector continues to expand. New orders,   shipments, and employment are higher this month, while inventories   in manufacturing are lower. The longer term outlook in both   retailing and manufacturing is still optimistic but less so than in   previous months. Reports of higher prices are less widespread than   in July. There is brisk activity in the market for existing housing   but very little recovery in new construction. Bankers report that   weakness in corporate loan demand is spurring requests by business   borrowers for concessions on loan terms.
District manufacturers, responding to the latest business outlook   survey, report a higher level of activity than last month. One third   of the businessmen surveyed see an improvement in overall business   conditions. Increases in new orders are reported by two fifths of   those polled, and a similar proportion say that shipments have   increased as well. Neither of these indicators showed any increase   last month. At the same time, work forces are larger at 16 percent   of the firms surveyed, while the average workweek is unchanged. One   key area showing no increase is inventories, which are slightly   lower this month after holding steady in July.
The outlook in manufacturing for the next six months is for further   expansion, although projections of gains are not so widespread as in   previous surveys. Of the executives polled, three out of five look   for better business conditions over the next two quarters. This is   down from last month, when three out of four respondents projected   improvement six months out, and well below the monthly average (four   out of five) for the first seven months of this year. Specific gains   are expected in new orders, shipments, and employment, but for each   of these barometers the proportion of respondents anticipating   increases is substantially below the levels of the recent past. In   addition to expansion in these categories, the average workweek and   inventories are each expected to increase over the period. At the   same time, 40 percent of the manufacturers surveyed plan to hike   their spending for plant and equipment, up somewhat from last month.
With respect to prices, 46 percent of the respondents indicate that   they are paying higher prices for their supplies. This is down from   last month when 57 percent were reporting increases. At the same   time, 27 percent report price hikes for their finished products,   about the same as in July. By February, roughly three out of four   expect to be paying more for their inputs and charging higher prices   for the products they sell. Retailers report only slight price   increases by suppliers and attribute this, in part, to the   uncertainty about retail sales prospects down the road.
Reports on area retail activity are mixed. Some merchants indicate   that current sales show little or no growth over the same period   last year, while others note increases of 9 to 10 percent. Almost   all of the retailers contacted, including some with 9 to 10 percent   gains, say that current sales volumes are falling short of the   levels they expected.
Major appliances and big-ticket furniture items are reported to be   particularly soft, while fashion accessories and recreational   equipment are singled out as strong sellers. Merchants note that   price markdowns on seasonal items occurred earlier than usual this   year, and they feel that these have helped generate a sizable chunk   of current sales. According to one retailer, "we've reduced prices   on seasonal items in the latest period in hopes of avoiding bigger   markdowns in the next period". All of the retailers contacted look   for a strong September, but several are reconsidering their   prospects and buying plans for later in the year. According to one   merchant, "we used to be cocky about the fallâ€”now we're just   confident". Yet another feels that, "if our December sales this year   just equal last year's, we'll have nothing to cry about".
The residential housing market in the area is reported to be very   active for existing housing, but only slight recovery is taking   place in new construction. There are signs that the rental market in   the area is tightening somewhat, which may open the way for a few   new multifamily units. By and large, however, the outlook is for no   substantial increase in new construction over the near term. One   mutual savings bank official notes that availability of funds is   good and that mortgage rates have declined recently. This official   expects rates to decline further in the near future before moving   upward by late fall. He even sees the possibility, although remote,   of a drop in rates paid on savings if short-term money market rates   decline further.
Bankers in the District report that, while consumer loans are   increasing, business loan volume remains weak. Most banks are   attempting to attract consumer business through either merchandise   promotions, lower rates, or extended maturities. The results,   however, are "not as good as expected". On the business side, there   are no reported signs of any pickup in loan demand. Several bankers   do note slightly increased pressure from corporate customers for   concessions on loan terms. More requests for fixed rates, as well as   early attempts to renegotiate terms on revolving credits, are   reported. For the most part, bankers indicate that these requests   have been denied. Several bankers feel, however, that, if business   loan demand remains weak, they may find it more difficult to deny   such requests in the future.
