Our directors report a continued gradual improvement in business,   with price pressure moderate compared with recent experience. Newly   negotiated wage packages are averaging gains of approximately 10   percent, but industries in their second or third year of contract   life are averaging less. Although some commodity prices—such as   aluminum scrap and natural gas—have risen quite sharply, most are   showing a decelerated rate of increase, and some (residual fuels and   nitrogen fertilizer) have actually declined. Construction of single-family residences has picked up, but multidwelling building remains   sluggish, due to the gap between prevailing rent structures and   building costs.
The annual wage bill increase in 1976 for newly negotiated contracts   is averaging about 10 percent. In many cases this represents a   considerable scaling-down of the unions' original demands. For   industries in their second or third year of a contract, gains have   been far less. One director reports that "increases are continuing,   but on the whole seem fairly moderate by standards of the recent   past".
Materials prices appear to be strengthening but, except in isolated   cases, increases have not been dramatic. Since the recovery began in   September of last year, a large manufacturer reports that scrap   aluminum prices have risen from 14 cents per pound to 30 cents per   pound; basic costs of pig aluminum and sheet increased an average of   15 percent, the same as the raw materials costs for basic resins   (polyester, epoxies, etc.); and steel products are also up about 15   percent over the same time frame. Paper products sold to the dairy   industry have increased 6 to 7 percent in price since the first of   the year. Motor gasoline has increased about 15 percent during 1976;   residual fuels are down 20 to 25 percent, and the price of the   remaining components of a barrel of crude are about the same as in   January. Current quotes for nitrogen fertilizer average around $130   a ton, down from a 1975 cost range of $210 to $230 a ton. Lumber   costs are up about 10 percent, and copper, which is still being sold   from stockpiles, is starting to increase. Energy costs, especially   for natural gas, continue to rise more rapidly than other costs.
Interest in plant expansion is still minimal, although the president   of a large manufacturing firm in California commented that, "with   production of steel approaching 90 percent of 'optimum' capacity, we   expect a continued, steady—though slower than mid-1974—increase in   capital spending".
New housing construction in the Twelfth District is concentrated in   single-family units, and the market is strengthening. Nevertheless,   a producer of aluminum siding reports that a 70 percent proportion   of its recent surge in sales was for existing home improvement   rather than for new construction. There continues to be a very   strong resale market for single-family dwellings based on profit   taking and upgrading.
Over the first half of 1976, there has been only slight improvement   in apartment construction, and the main reason cited is the   disparity between current rent scales and construction costs (craft   wages). One bank in Oregon calculates that rental fees of 29 to 32   cents per square foot are needed to finance new construction,   whereas current rentals are said to support only a 23 to 25 cents   per square foot level.
In southern California, vacancy rates are down and rents are   reported to have increased sufficiently to have sparked some   interest in apartment construction, but the market tone remains   sluggish. On the other hand, a strengthening trend toward building   more duplexes and "fourplexes" has been noted. One reporter comments   that passage of the tax reform bill with the Kennedy-Haskell   amendment would eliminate multiple-dwelling investment as a tax   shelter and further reduce construction levels.
Many farmers and ranchers are experiencing a very trying 1976. The   farmers who sold crops immediately after harvesting have made a   profit, but those who placed their crops in storage have been facing   a continually declining schedule of prices and, in many cases, will   have to sell at a loss.
The optimism about higher cattle prices is beginning to diminish.   Because of heavy losses taken this year on fattened cattle, the   prospect is for a poor feeder cattle market this fall.
