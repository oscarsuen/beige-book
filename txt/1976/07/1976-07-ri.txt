Responses to our latest survey of Fifth District business conditions   suggest a decided pause in the current expansion. Manufacturers   reports suggest a decline in new orders in June, with shipments   apparently showing no change and backlogs of orders falling off.   Inventories of finished goods were reported to be larger than a   month earlier and current levels are considered excessive by nearly   one-third of our respondents. Despite this apparent slackening in   the rate of advance, District manufacturers remain optimistic.   Expectations of continued gains in the level of business activity   are not quite as widespread as in some recent months, but over one-half of our manufacturing respondents expect further improvement   over the next six months. Beyond some normal lengthening of lead   times, there are no signs of any difficulties arising with respect   to the availability of materials and supplies. Reports from   retailers indicate a similar pattern of activity: sluggish sales, a   relative decline in sales of big ticket items, and further expansion   of inventories. Large District banks report only nominal growth of   commercial and industrial loan volume in recent weeks. In the   agricultural sector, the general condition of most major field crops   in the District has improved in recent weeks in response to much-needed rain and warmer weather.
Of manufacturers responding to our survey, one-half report no change   in shipments over the past month. The remaining one-half are evenly   divided between reporting increases and decreases. Meanwhile, over   40 percent indicate reduced volume of new orders and over one-third   report declines in backlogs of orders. More than one-third also   reported increased inventories of finished goods, while stocks of   materials were apparently unchanged. Inventory levels are now   considered excessive by nearly one-third of our manufacturing   respondents, while nearly as many view current plant and equipment   capacity in excess. Nonetheless, employment continues to rise in   most sectors of the District economy, and reports of higher prices   are widespread.
Among individual industries textile, apparel, chemical, and   furniture manufacturers seem to have been typical, experiencing some   weakness in the volume of new orders. Respondents from the primary   metals industry report little change from a month ago, while   producers of machinery and equipment showed some gains in this area.   Inventories are considered excessive in furniture and fixtures,   while in most other industries a majority of respondents consider   current levels about right. There are individual respondents in   virtually every industry surveyed, however, who feel current stocks   are excessive.
Citing cooler than usual weather and a general lack of consumer   confidence, retailers responding to our survey report marginally   weaker sales in June and the first relative decline in sales of big   ticket items since December. Reports suggest a continuing spate of   bargain hunting, but with consumers retaining an eye for quality.   Rather widespread inventory accumulation and the recent sluggish   sales pace have left over 70 percent of our retail respondents with   what they feel are excessive inventories. Price increases at the   retail level are reported with greater frequency than in recent   months, although most respondents report no change in prices,   received or paid, since May. Retailers remain optimistic about the   level of business activity, particularly with respect to sales in   their own firms. Nearly 60 percent expect further improvement in the   level of activity nationally and in their individual market areas   over the next six months, but over 80 percent expect sales in their   own firms to improve over that time period.
The availability of supplies and materials does not appear to be   presenting any serious problems in the Fifth District. Most of our   contacts in industry report at worst some lengthening of lead time,   but even that is considered normal. Most firms continue to report   that their orders are being met promptly and that they anticipate no   difficulties in meeting orders for their own products. Only one   respondent, an apparel manufacturer, reported operations being   hampered by the performance of his key suppliers. One manufacturer   mentioned the rubber strike, which he feels would adversely affect   operations by the end of July.
Despite seasonal strength in business credit demand from   agriculture-related industry, total C&I loan volume at large   District banks has shown only nominal growth in recent weeks.   According to area bankers, continued cyclical weakness in business   loans is due to two basic factors. First, local industry reaction to   the recent slowing in nondurable sales has been swift and   conservative. In North Carolina, for example, the textile industry   is said to have quickly tightened production to forestall unwanted   inventory accumulation. Second, there is almost complete lack of   term loan requests for purposes of business fixed investment.   Consequently, loan volume is still below desired levels. Consumer   lending is still advancing, but not as rapidly as in recent months.   This seems to hold for both revolving credits and direct installment   loans. Large District S&Ls generally report that the demand for   mortgage funds remains very strong.
In the agricultural sector, earnings from farm marketings continue   to run above a year ago. But the 2 percent gain in the District   during January-April was much smaller than the 10 percent increase   recorded nationally. The corn outlook is especially promising, with   prospects for a record harvest in North Carolina. However, excessive   soil moisture is causing problems for crop farmers in many areas of   South Carolina.
