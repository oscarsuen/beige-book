Activity in the Fourth District is marked by slowing gains in   manufacturing, some revival in retail sales, and spotty recovery in   capital goods. Directors and other respondents still report no   shortages nor are any expected in the near future, although supplies   of some types of steel, plastics and packaging materials have   tightened. Deposit inflows at thrift institutions have slowed   sharply, and expectations are that mortgage interest rates will rise   unless deposit growth strengthens.
Retailers report a pickup in June sales, following two monthly   declines. Although they view the revival with some skepticism, they   remain cautiously optimistic that near-term prospects for consumer   spending remain favorable. A director associated with a major   national retail chain said orders placed by department stores are   reportedly very high, but a few retailers apparently have lowered   their commitments for future delivery. An economist associated with   a major retailer is skeptical about the June recovery because of the   spotty nature of the pickup (apparel and soft goods still weak,   furniture sales strong) and the need for sales promotions to induce   consumer response. He expects sales gains will not be as large as he   estimated a few months ago.
In contrast, an economist with a large producer of major appliances   views the recent decline in retail sales as temporary and expects a   second wave of rapid expansion later in 1976. He attributed the   spring slowdown to emerging price resistance by consumers,   flattening in housing starts and an ending to the effects of tax   cuts early in 1975.
Recovery in capital goods remains mixed. Two large producers of   machine tools report orders in recent months have exceeded shipments   for the first time since mid-1974. Heavy-duty truck sales picked up   last quarter from near trough lows, according to a major supplier in   the industry. A producer of earthmoving equipment for mining,   construction and logging industries continues to lay off workers and   will suspend operations for at least a month over July and August   for lack of orders. Another major capital goods producer, where   orders so far in 1976 have risen only about 3 percent from 1975,   reports inquiries have increased, indicating a step-up in orders   later in 1976. That firm's capital spending plans for this year are   below last year's outlays. Its major capital investment program   includes purchasing a mining company as a hedge against expected   rising prices for basic materials. Projections of a high rate of   inflation, relatively slow growth in economic activity, and adequate   capacity in its industry are among the reasons cited for its   conservative spending plans over the next few years. A director with   a diversified firm also indicated his company's capital spending for   1976 will be considerably less than previously anticipated, but can   be boosted quickly depending upon the strength of customer demand.
There is yet little indication of shortages or bottlenecks in any of   the key manufacturing industries in the District, although steel,   plastics and packaging industries are tight in some product lines.   Major steel producers in the District report order books for flat   rolled products are full for the third quarter. One mill apparently   turned away some business that was later placed with other domestic   sources. Demand for other steel products, such as plates, structural   steel and pipe, remains weak. Steel operations will drop less than   usual for the summer months; operations will likely remain close to   90 percent of capacity, except that some mills may temporarily shut   down for needed repairs. One of the largest producers does not   expect to boost capital outlays until 1977.
A director described the supply of raw materials as adequate for the   near term. Coke and iron ore are potential sources of problems for   steel producers. One steel economist expects no shortages of raw   materials this year, but said a coke shortage may surface in 1977   because of environmental constraints. Another economist said that   inability to meet environmental standards may require his company to   shut down ore mines in Minnesota. Three domestic steel producers and   a prominent ore producer announced joint plans to sharply boost   pellitized ore capacity, but production would not be available until   late 1979 or early 1980.
The 2 1/2-month-old rubber strike is still not expected to shut down   the auto industry, according to an economist associated with a major   tire producer. The rubber industry continues to operate at about 50   percent of capacity but is expected to operate at 100 percent for at   least a year following contract settlement. Contract talks appear   deadlocked, but he pointed out that loss of medical, life insurance,   and accident benefits, which expire next week, might speed up   settlement.
Supplies of several types of nondurable goods, including food,   packaging and paperboard, are judged to be adequate but supplies of   glass containers and plastics are tightening. A director remarked   that capacity in the food processing industry is adequate. Glass   container producers are expected to operate close to capacity in   1976, although supplies of these containers are described as tight   but not critical. No shortage is expected in 1976 or 1977, in part   because of the substitution of metal for glass containers. The   paperboard industry is operating at about 91 percent of capacity,   well below the 1974 peak, but supplies are expected to tighten as   the industry approaches 100 percent operations later next year.   Capacity additions in packing and paperboard industries in the last   few years have been small because of the high cost of building new   plants.
Polyvinyl chloride is in tight supply. One major producer is   operating at about 90 percent of effective capacity compared with 80   percent in the first quarter of 1976. Effective capacity of the   industry, although higher than during the peak in 1973-1974, has   been reduced because of environmental constraints. Sources   associated with the industry expect no shortages such as were   experienced during the last peak.
Financial officers associated with savings and loans report a   seasonal to larger-than-seasonal slowing of deposit inflows in June.   Mortgage loan demand is described as heavy. The view of two   officials is that mortgage rates will rise unless demand softens or   deposits grow as rapidly as they did earlier in 1976.
Business loan demand at banks is described as flat to weak by two   directors. A director with a large bank attributes continued weak   loan demand to corporate use of long-term debt and equity markets,   the sluggish pace of capital spending and tight inventory control by   business firms.
