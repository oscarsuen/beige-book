Financial officers associated with savings and loans report a seasonal to larger-than-seasonal slowing of deposit inflows in June. Mortgage loan demand is described as heavy. The view of two officials is that mortgage rates will rise unless demand softens or deposits grow as rapidly as they did earlier in 1976. Business loan demand at banks is described as flat to weak by two directors. A director with a large bank attributes continued weak loan demand to corporate use of long-term debt and equity markets, the sluggish pace of capital spending and tight inventory control by business firms.
