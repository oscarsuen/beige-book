While New York City loan demand remains sluggish, competition for demand deposits has developed as a result of mutual savings banks bidding for commercial bank customers. Recent legislation now permits mutual savings banks in New York State to issue non interest-bearing demand deposits. A trade association for these thrift institutions indicated that as of the end of June three-fourths of its membership (84 out of 118 members) were offering these accounts. In the few weeks that the accounts have been available, deposits have grown rapidly and already exceed $100 million. In response to this rapid growth and aggressive marketing by savings banks, commercial banks have begun to eliminate or substantially reduce checking charges. While the regional recovery generally continues to lag the national economy, there were some encouraging developments in the District's employment situation. The New York State unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) declined 0.6 percentage points to 8.9 percent in May, the first time in 30 months that it was lower than a year earlier. In Buffalo, where joblessness has persistently been the worst in the District, the unemployment rate fell from a high of 12.1 percent in March to 10.4 percent in May. This is also well below its 11.5 percent rate of May 1975. After holding steady at 10.7 percent in March and April, the New York City unemployment rate fell to 10.1 percent. This improvement is somewhat illusory, however, since it was caused less by an increase in jobholders than by a reduction in the work force. Indeed, New York City's recovery from the recession has fallen further behind that of the nation. The city's unemployment rate in May was 3.4 percentage points higher than the national rate, while in January this difference was only 2.6 percentage points. Of the five downstate counties surrounding New York City, each registered improvement in the jobless rate, but only one had a rate below the national average.
