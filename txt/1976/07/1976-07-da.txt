The economic recovery in the southwest has slowed, and although many   signs of strength are still evident, some areas of weakness are   currently hampering further overall improvement. This month's survey   touches on retail sales, construction, drilling activity, and cattle   feeding. The results suggest a mixed economic picture. New auto   sales are strong and the pace of residential housing starts is again   picking up after leveling sing off for four months. Moreover,   drilling activity should increase further over the remainder of the   year - especially if the interstate price of natural gas is raised.   Despite the areas of strength, department store sales have softened.   Highway construction remains one of the weakest sectors of the Texas   economy, and placements of calves in feedlots have slowed because   fed cattle prices have fallen well below production costs.
Sales of new cars and pickup trucks are strong throughout the   District. The biggest demand continues to be for intermediate size   cars. Demand for large models is also up sharply largely because   General Motors plans to reduce the size of many large models in the   1977 production year to the intermediate size range. The auto   dealers surveyed feel the announced 6 percent price increase for the   1977 models has had no effect in stimulating purchases of the   remaining 1976 models. Inventory levels of intermediate and large   model cars and trucks are low, and some dealers are completely out   of the most popular models or will be before the 1977 models are   introduced. Inventories of compact cars, however, are plentiful as   sales of these models have not met previous sales expectations.   Large price discounts will likely be necessary to move the current   inventory of small cars.
Most respondents in a survey of department store executives   described business as "pretty good" but pointed to a softening in   sales in the past few months. About half of the respondents felt the   softness was centered in durable goods, and about half felt the   weakness was largely in nondurable goods. Inventories are generally   on the "high side," but remain at manageable levels. As a result,   most department stores continue to take a conservative approach to   building inventories, and some have found the time required for   delivery of some goods has begun to stretch out. All respondents   felt retail sales would show steady improvement in the last half of   the year.
After leveling off for four months, the pace of residential   construction in Texas has again begun to quicken. Most of the   activity continues to be in single family starts, but some builders   look to a significant improvement in multi-family construction by   the beginning of next year. One reason for the slower than normal   recovery in single family housing, according to a San Antonio   contractor, was the news media publishing stories that new homes   have become unaffordable. Another builder attributes the current   strength in new starts to the fact that people now see that they can   make mortgage payments despite higher prices and interest rates.
With the exception of single family housing, construction activity   in the southwest remains depressed, and one of the weakest sectors   is highway construction. In Texas, the growth in highway   construction funds has tapered off with slowdowns in both federal   funding and state tax revenues. And with road building costs rising   at an estimated 15 percent per year, actual construction put in   place is being sharply reduced. A few contractors have gone out of   business, while others are selling off used equipment and are   cutting back their work forces. The decline in demand for materials   used in road building is largely responsible for the depressed   market for construction steel and reduced output in the stone, clay   and glass industry.
Although the number of active drilling rigs in Texas is about 4   percent below the high levels attained a year ago, an increase began   a month ago and most industry spokesmen anticipate further gains in   drilling over the remainder of the year. But many drillers no longer   expect the gains to be as strong as anticipated two months ago.   Activity seems to be restrained by the rollback in prices for crude   oil, and many drillers report that proposed tax law changes and the   threat of divestiture could discourage investment in the industry.   Nevertheless, many independent drillers expect that the Federal   Power Commission will raise natural gas prices from $.53 per   thousand cubic feet to as much as $1.50 by September. If a large   increase is granted, exploratory drilling for gas should rise   sharply.
Placements of calves in southwestern feedlots slowed considerably in   June from the increased levels of late 1975 and early 1976. Bankers   financing cattle feeders expect placements to remain low as fed   cattle prices have edged below feeder cattle prices and the cost of   grain. One banker reported that with current prices for fed cattle   around $40 to $41 per hundredweight and the cost of grain near $48   per hundredweight, cattle feeders are incurring heavy losses.   Considering the losses, cattle feeders and bankers are cautious   about placing new cattle on feed. Thus, the demand for feeder cattle   loans has weakened. The weakness in fed cattle prices apparently is   caused partially by the increased slaughter of heavier weight   grassfed calves as prices for feeder calves are restrained by the   lower demand for feedlot replacements.
