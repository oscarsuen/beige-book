Residential building in the Tenth District, especially of single-family homes, has been very strong through the first half of 1976,   and builders are optimistic about the remainder of the year. Cash   inflows to savings and loan associations continue to be heavy, and   loan rates are expected to remain stable through year's end. Tourist   and recreation business in the District's mountain states has also   been very good. Wheat harvest in the District is proceeding   satisfactorily, with total production now estimated to be   significantly greater than originally expected. District commercial   banks report strong business loan demand in June.
Builders and home builders' associations across the Tenth District   report a good year so far in residential construction activity,   especially for single-family homes. There is more activity in   custom-built homes than in speculative building, with some scattered   reports of increasing stocks of the latter. Multi-family unit   construction is generally reported as stagnant, except in New   Mexico. Most builders remain optimistic for the rest of 1976, and   some stretch their optimism through the first half of 1977. A few   respondents expressed some fear of overstocking of houses by year's   end, especially in Colorado, and most have a fear of rising mortgage   costs later this year.
According to spokesmen for Tenth District savings and loan   associations surveyed, rates on a typical 80 percent conventional   loan now range from 8.75 percent to 9.5 percent, with 9 percent the   most commonly reported rate. Most respondents expect rates to hold   at the above levels, at least through the end of 1976. Cash inflows   have been very strong in early July, and loan demand was generally   characterized as strong. Several reporters noted that their firms   had experienced withdrawals of funds that seemed clearly intended   for purchase of consumer durable goods, especially new automobiles.
The tourist and outdoor recreation business in the Rocky Mountain   states of the Tenth District has been very good so far this summer,   with the peak months yet to come. There are more tourists, spending   more money, than in 1974 and 1975. One respondent described the   situation in Wyoming as "back to normal—back to the pre-oil   embargo days." All states report a greater proportion of campers, a   trend toward all tourists staying in one area longer and spending   less time on the road, and a spending pattern that includes more   spending on gasoline but saving elsewhere.
Farm prices have been exhibiting strength in recent months despite   the favorable prospects for agricultural output. For the month ended   June 15, 1976, the index of prices received by farmers advanced 2   percent, as gains in soybean, corn, and hog prices more than offset   the slippage in cattle prices. At mid-June, prices were about 5   percent above year-ago levels.
In recent weeks, the Russians have purchased about 1.5 million   metric tons of soybeans in addition to about 4 million tons of wheat   and corn under the grain agreement consummated last fall. The   general strength in foreign demand, together with the continued   expansion in livestock feeding domestically, explains the uptrend in   grain prices until recently. However, if the summer and fall crops   turn out as large as currently projected, grain prices could   experience additional retrenchment.
The District's wheat harvest is progressing satisfactorily, although   the rate of progress is behind last year's pace as well as the 10-year average. Nevertheless, production prospects in the major wheat   states appear to be higher than originally expected. Recent   estimates for Oklahoma and Kansas, where harvest is virtually   complete, are 151 and 322 million bushels, respectively, down about   7 percent from last year. The Nebraska crop is also expected to be   reasonably good, but output in Colorado is disappointing because of   weather difficulties. For the nation, total wheat production is   expected to be about 100 million bushels below last year, with   spring wheat output partially offsetting the decline in the winter   wheat production.
Most Tenth District banks contacted reported strong increases in   business loan demand during June. Several of the banks indicated   that a source of strength in loan demand was their participation in   smaller banks' loans. Others, however, indicated that demand for   loans arose primarily from their own customers. No particular   industry or loan purpose dominated demand. Reasons for borrowing,   nonetheless, included both inventory financing and capacity   expansion. Agricultural loans—primarily to finance cattle   inventories—also rose strongly in June, with participation again   being a factor. Consumer loans generally rose, with auto loans   showing the most strength.
Banks stated that their levels of negotiable CD's have bottomed out,   but that they do not expect increases in loan demand strong enough   to necessitate a buildup at this time. Several banks mentioned   surprising strength in demand deposits as another reason for keeping   low CD levels.
