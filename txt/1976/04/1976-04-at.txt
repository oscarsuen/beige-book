Improvement continues in the Southeast, except for some parts of the   construction industry. Branch directors find the region   strengthening steadily. Sales of automobiles and trucks continue to   grow rapidly. Businesses serving vacationers continue to provide   major boosts to the region. Changes in lumber demand and prices are   occurring. Possible shortages are perceived in parts of the steel   industry. Despite some improvement in condominium and mobile homes,   the construction industry's condition remains mixed.
Branch directors' comments indicate steady improvement and a   generally optimistic outlook; diverse indicators are cited to   support this view. A Jacksonville director notes that the recession   seems to be disappearing and that air cargo shipments are up.   Another states that optimism remains strong and cites a 30 percent   increase in advertising outlays over last year. A director from   Miami finds steady, if not vigorous, improvement supported by record   consumer spending; he notes a 53 percent growth in tonnage at Dade   County Seaport, with increases from last year in all classes of   goods. A New Orleans branch director cites increased industrial   development activity in Mississippi as a sign of an improving   business climate, but a second director notes a wait-and-see   attitude on the part of central Louisiana businessmen concerned   about the strength and duration of the upturn. Birmingham branch   directors cite strengthening in textiles and apparel, increasing   industrial expansion, and extremely good truck transportation   business as indicators of continued improvement. As evidence of a   continuing steady recovery, Nashville directors note continued gains   in March retail sales in connection with new shopping centers and   downtown area renovation.
Motor vehicle sales continue to grow rapidly throughout most of the   Southeast. Auto sales increased sharply in February and March. Weak   sales of imported models and strength in sales of full-size and   luxury domestic models also persisted. Substantial gains from last   year, as well as a confident view of the future, are widely   reported. Truck sales have been equally vigorous. Recreational   vehicle sales have increased, according to reports from Alabama and   Florida.
Tourist attractions continue to lead the Southeast's recovery.   Nashville's "Grand Ole Opry" is completely sold out through   November. Motels on the east coast of Florida are completely full,   and tourist businesses are "booming." Miami is also enjoying an   exceptional season. Gains in attendance at central Florida tourist   centers continue, and advance bookings are heavy. Vacationers are   reportedly less budget conscious this year, and expenditures per   person have risen.
Developments in industry include a leveling of demand for all kinds   of lumber, reflecting the completion of inventory rebuilding by   lumber yards throughout the country. Prices remain firm but are no   longer increasing; they remain near the high of late 1973 and early   1974. Another report expresses concern regarding sharp price   increases which are likely to result if timber harvests from   national forests are curtailed as a result of environmental   restrictions imposed by legislative and judicial bodies.
A firm which services offshore oil wells fears that continued   production increases in autos and other steel-using industries may   cause a recurrence of shortages of pipe and other tubular goods.   Inventories are being increased. An executive with a major steel   company expects steel products to be on allocation by the middle of   the third quarter. A new steel mill nearing completion in the   Jacksonville area will provide a partial offset to steel shortages.   The electric furnace mill will begin production in midsummer of   steel billets and by yearend expects to start manufacturing   reinforcing bars. About 200,000 tons of steel products are expected   to be produced annually.
Conditions in the construction industry appear to have brightened   somewhat. Single-family home building and sales remain the major   area of activity; with some exceptions, nonresidential construction   is sluggish. Slight improvement is noted in Nashville's condominium   market. In the Miami area, condominium sales have shown little   change in the past 3 months, but the first sign in 3 years of   reduced inventories has appeared. Apartment vacancy rates have   stabilized or declined in several areas. Mobile home sales show a   varied pattern. In one area of Florida, sales are still falling,   while elsewhere, sales have increased. Rising sales of mobile homes   in Alabama are attributed to customers' inability to afford   conventional housing. Financing of mobile home sales is creating   difficulties as a result of banks' unfavorable loss experience.
