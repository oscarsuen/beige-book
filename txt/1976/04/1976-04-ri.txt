Responses to our April survey of Fifth District business conditions   indicate a more general improvement in the level of activity than at   any time in the past year. A majority of manufacturing respondents   report gains in shipments, new orders, and backlogs of orders in   March, with increases in employment and in hours worked as well.   Finished goods stocks apparently declined further while stocks of   materials are reported to have stabilized or increased slightly.   Responses suggest, however, that some further reductions in   inventories may be necessary to bring them to desired levels.   Reports of excessive plant and equipment capacity are less common   than in recent months, but on balance current capacity remains in   excess. Retailers report increased sales, with 80 percent of   respondents indicating gains in sales of big ticket items relative   to total sales. Retail inventories are now apparently in line with   desired levels despite little change in March. Both manufacturing   and retail respondents remain optimistic, expecting further   improvement in the level of business activity over the next six   months. Fifth District banks continue to experience unusually slack   business loan demand, but increased loan demand from consumers has   resulted in a modest expansion in bank loans in recent weeks.
Among manufacturers responding to our survey this month, nearly 55   percent report increases in shipments and new orders in March.   Backlogs also were up at a majority of manufacturers. Inventories of   finished goods continued to decline in March, but there was   apparently some buildup of materials stocks. In any event,   manufacturing respondents viewing current inventory levels as   excessive outnumber those viewing them as inadequate by more than   two to one. One textile manufacturer reported being in the process   of reducing inventories to an all time low.
Among individual industries, survey responses suggest textile and   apparel manufacturers continuing to outperform most others, although   improvements were much more widespread this month than last. Non-electrical equipment and machinery manufacturers reported   improvements in business as did manufacturers of furniture and   fixtures. Survey responses suggest that demand continues to lag in   the chemicals industry.
Nearly one-third of the manufacturing respondents reported increased   employment in March, and over one-third reported working an   increased number of hours per week. Prices, including employee   compensation, continue to rise, but there is no apparent change in   the trend of recent months. Almost three-fourths of the   manufacturing respondents expect the level of business activity   nationally and in their individual market areas to improve over the   next six months, while two-thirds expect increased production within   their own firms.
Retailers reported a larger volume of sales and a higher proportion   of sales of big ticket items than in recent months. Increased demand   for consumer loans and improved sales of big ticket items are   consistent with reports from many parts of the Fifth District   confirming a significant improvement in consumer confidence and   willingness to buy, Inventories at retail were essentially unchanged   in March and are apparently in line with desired levels. One-third   of the retailers surveyed now view their present number and size of   outlets as inadequate. Over 80 percent expect the level of business   activity nationally, regionally, and in their own firms to improve   further over the next six months.
Bankers in several District states have reported noticeable   increases in consumer lending activity in recent weeks. Improved   consumer confidence is cited as an important factor contributing to   this increase. Conversely, business loan demand remains unusually   depressed. While there is some evidence of lending gains with   regional business customers, loans to locally important industries,   for example textiles, continue to be soft. Commercial and industrial   loans at Fifth District weekly reporting banks are now at their   lowest level since early 1974. One weekly reporting bank expects no   significant increase in its commercial lending at least until fall.
District farmers' cash receipts from farm marketings in January were   4 percent below a year earlier, with a sharp drop in crop receipts   more than offsetting a significant gain in receipts from livestock   and livestock products. By comparison, the nation's total cash farm   receipts recorded an 8 percent gain in January. Commercial peach and   apple crops in Virginia and the Carolinas sustained varying amounts   of freeze damage in mid-March. Losses ranged from light to severe.   Land preparation for spring planting is generally ahead of schedule;   corn planting is proceeding ahead of last year's pace; tobacco   transplanting is underway; and small grains are in good condition.
