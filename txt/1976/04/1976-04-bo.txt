The directors of the First District are unsettled by recent   developments. The strong performance of retail sales has waned in   the past few weeks, while new orders placed with capital goods   manufacturers have remained weak. Consequently, the business outlook   has lost some of the post-Christmas glow. Overall, the recent data   present a mixed picture, but the directors emphasize that their   attitude is still positive on the wholeâ€”their forecasts, however,   are scaled back to less optimistic levels.
Retail sales have been disappointing since the latter part of March.   In Connecticut, trade volume has not held up as well as businessmen   had hoped. For that State, retailers report "poor" to "fair" consumer response. In Massachusetts, a similar softness is evident   as well. A director, whose retail business has remained relatively   strong, commented that he is concerned about inventories, even   though he believes that the opportunities for growth are good. He   reported that his buyers' order placements are higher than they   should be, especially in view of continued favorable vendor   performance. According to his analysis, manufacturers are still   attempting to recoup 1973 sales levels and attain high levels of   capacity utilization.
Manufacturing output has begun to fall in several areas of New   England. Responding mainly to weaknesses in the new orders for   capital goods, layoffs have increased and average weekly hours have   fallen in Connecticut. The durable goods industries, especially   machine tools, have yet to participate in the recovery. Most firms   which are maintaining levels of production are completing backlogged   orders essentially.
Mortgage business is beginning to recover, but other categories of   loan demand generally remain stagnant. Bankers report that the   mortgage activity is heaviest for higher priced existing units. The   mortgage interest rate may fall another 1/4 point, but lenders   expect no dramatic price cutting on this front.
Variable rate mortgages are being tested in a variety of areas, and,   for the most part, they are written at interest rates 50 basis   points below similar conventionals. Similar to California contracts,   they guarantee the initial rate for 1 year and subsequently rates   may change by 25 basis points every 6 months.
Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, and Samuelson were available for   comment this month. Houthakker found the pickup in M1 growth "somewhat reassuring" in that it increased the probability of a   sustained recovery. He was not alarmed by the reported size of the   Teamster settlement but was concerned about the increases in the   weekly commodity spot prices. If loan demand strengthens, a small   rise in short-term rates would be in order. Eckstein said the   economy is recovering somewhat faster than had been expected, mainly   because of better progress in curbing inflation. While he agreed   with the Chairman's view that the progress in prices may be a brief   respite, the recent favorable experience still constitutes a part of   the total record. Because money aggregates "have ceased to give   guidance," according to Eckstein, "there is no choice but to look at   interest rates." It would be a grave error to keep interest rates   low for most of 1976 and to raise them dramatically in 1977."   Instead, the Federal Funds rate should begin a gradual ascent of   about 25 basis points each quarter. Samuelson also urged "thinking   hard" about the current level of interest rates. The Fed should be   prepared for the possibility that the economy will be stronger than   had been forecasted. In that event, it might be wiser to permit   short-term rates to begin to ease upward even though this would be   likely to terminate the downward drift in long-term rates.
