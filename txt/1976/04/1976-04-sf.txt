In the opinion of our directors, business has been expanding at a   moderate pace; and although the pace has not been labeled   disappointing, it appears to be taking longer than usual for the   pronounced strength in consumer spending to feed back into inventory   demand. At some point, the business community might be convinced   that the trend in consumer spending will be sustained and a rapid   inventory build-up will take place. Price trends are being watched   closely. Current evidence of lowered inflationary expectations is   confined to agricultural products and some specific industries like   pulp and paper where demand has remained weak. Wage package demands,   however, are reported to be lower than last year. Plans for new   plant and equipment spending that had been shelved during the   recession are being dusted off but are being inhibited by   environment protection studies and anxiety over price trends. Some   bankers appear concerned over the continuing low level of business   loan demand.
Evidence of lower inflationary expectations was reported by several   directors, although the general consensus appears to be that wage   and benefit packages will be up about 10 percent this year. The   directors seem loath to give a long-term interpretation to current   lower food price levels and lower quotes for such items as   fertilizer, corrugated cartons, burlap, brass and titanium and are   cautiously awaiting price reaction to an anticipated second-half   swelling of demand. Those directors connected with natural gas   production seem most convinced that inflation will recur as a very   serious problem. More precisely, it is anticipated that price   increases will continue at a modest rate for the next 3 to 4 months,   but inflationary pressures during the latter half of 1976 will   increase with food, energy and wages the major areas of concern. The   inflation rate for the year is expected to be in the neighborhood of   6 percent, down significantly from 1975.
For the most part, industry in the far west appears to be marking   time. New orders for commercial aircraft have been quiet although   steady, and the overall pulp market is still soft. Activity in   timber and wood products has picked up recently as wholesalers   replenish low inventories in the light of increased residential   housing activity. Other industries such as chemicals, steel and   pleasure boat building report steady expansion. Nonferrous mineral   activity, notably aluminum, remains depressed, but the value of coal   output is up about 25 percent.
Some capital formation in the form of modernized equipment is being   put in place, but sights are not currently being raised.   Environmental impact studies have, in some cases, slowed the rate of   new construction. A further inhibition to power plant construction   is the fact that rate structures which provide the basis for   securing funds in the marketplace must be approved by the public   service commission. Many California projects appear to be on hold   awaiting the results of the June Atomic Energy initiative. Public   works construction is down from a year ago. One director from a   large west coast bank, however, reports that there are early signs   of renewed general interest in plant and equipment spending that   will become supportive of the recovery late this year and in 1977.
Cash receipts from farming in 1975 just about equaled 1974 in spite   of a lower price for wheat. So far in 1976, irrigation has been   sufficient to counter low rainfall, but farmers would suffer if next   year's rainfall were below normal. Many items used in farming have   declined drastically in price over the last year; fertilizer and   insecticide prices have fallen as much as 25 to 30 percent and costs   of corrugated cartons and burlap sacks have declined for the past   two packing seasons. Prices of farm machinery, however, continue to   escalate. The agriculture industry does not anticipate heavy   spending for expansion this year.
Business borrowing at commercial banks has been lethargic as a   result of abundant corporate liquidity and the prevailing cost   differential between bank loans and commercial paper issues.   Consumer loan and real estate demand have been very strong,   bolstering the notion that the consumer is leading the way out of   the recession.
