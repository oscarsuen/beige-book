The Teamsters' negotiations apparently were settled with only minor,   temporary walkouts in this District, and these were largely confined   to the Detroit area. The cost of the Teamsters' 3-year package is   difficult to evaluate. A Detroit union official calls the contract "the best we ever got," and says many over-the-road drivers paid by   the mile could get $10,400 more per year at the end of 3 years,   boosting some into the $30,000 to $35,000 range. This 40 to 50   percent boost assumes a 6 percent per year rise in the CPI under the   new unlimited COLA. Without COLA increase, the 3-year contract is   said to call for a 33 percent rise in costs, with large boost for   pension contributions as required by the new law.
Some knowledgeable analysts in the District are very concerned about   a serious rubber industry strike starting next week. For the first   time, three or four of the largest producers may be struck   simultaneously. The various issues, including a COLA, may not be   resolved without a walkout that might last 60 days. Output of autos   and trucks probably would be affected in 30 to 40 days as stocks of   tires are limited. Many other essential industrial products would be   cut off by a rubber strike. Unlike the Teamsters' settlement, the   rubber contract eventually decided upon is likely to set a pattern.   The main issues in the UAW contracts coming up this fall are not   clear, but General Motors has suggested reevaluation of the company-paid medical-dental program which now costs $150 per worker per   month and is rising rapidly even without further liberalization of   benefits. Chicago lithographers recently agreed to forego a   scheduled wage boost in order to slow the migration of printing and   graphic arts, but such reports are unusual. Chicago teachers   reluctantly agreed to an 8.5 percent salary cut to be achieved by   shortening the current school year.
Virtually all consumer hard goods, especially autos and most   appliances, are selling well again. Sales gains at general   merchandise stores for March are very impressive in view of the much   later date of Easter this year. General merchandisers are pleased   with the improvement in their profit margins, which reflect lower   carrying costs of inventories as well as higher volume. Food   retailers, however, are having a difficult time maintaining their   profit margins in the face of rising costs of labor, transportation,   fuel, insurance and other overhead. Increases in these expenses also   plague private schools, hospitals, and other institutions.
The increase in sales of autos and light to lower-medium weight   trucks has exceeded the hopes of most industry analysts. Inventories   of popular models are inadequate to meet sales potential. The   increase in sales has been concentrated in the compact and   intermediate-sized with the subcompacts and standards losing ground   relatively. Better gas mileage on domestic models and relatively   improved price relationships have helped reduce the market   penetration of imports. Sales of larger trucks have remained at a   very depressed level, but output is being expanded to meet an   expected rise in demand coming about midyear as truck freight   continues to increase.
Purchasing agents' reports for both Chicago and Milwaukee were very   promising for March with significant gains in new orders, output   and, most recently, employment. More firms are reporting increases   in order backlogs, and many are beginning to rebuild inventories of   purchased materials and components. Producers of basic materials   such as steel and cement are boosting forecasts of output for the   year. Steel imports are at a lower rate than most observers had   expected, perhaps because foreign producers are reluctant to match   U. S. prices.
Manufacturers of capital goods components report continued   improvement in orders for such products as controls and motors.   Partly this reflects "bare bones" inventories of distributors. Some   utilities indicate they are moving ahead on deferred capital   expenditure programs as financial positions have improved and   certain regulatory obstacles have been resolved. Announcements of   expanded capital expenditure plans in other industries are rare.   Capacity is currently ample in most types of manufacturing,   transportation, trade, and finance and vacancy rates in commercial   buildings are high, both downtown and in the suburbs.
Despite much talk that "the average family can't afford a home any   more," transactions have been at a very brisk pace both in   preoccupied units and in new housing. Single-family homes are moving   at prices 50 percent higher than 5 years ago in good areas. New   building is beginning to revive, but mainly in single-family   developments and townhouses.
