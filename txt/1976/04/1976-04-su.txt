The recent surge in consumer spending is broadly based. Auto sales   and "big ticket" items are reported to be selling well and exceeding   expectations, according to nearly all District reports. New York   describes the consumer as being less price conscious. Atlanta   reports tourism is "booming" on the east coast of Florida and   advance bookings for central Florida are heavy. Several Districts   commented that retailers are bullish with respect to prospects   through 1976.
Tight control seems to keynote comments concerning retail and   manufacturing inventories. Higher consumer spending has yet to be   translated into higher inventories. Retailers are apparently   cautious with respect to building stocks and they are more likely to   err on the low side, although a large department store chain will   apparently boost its inventory. Low inventories for controls,   motors, and timber have strengthened orders for those products,   while tire production has been boosted because of an anticipated   work stoppage in the rubber industry as well as low stocks relative   to sales. Manufacturers' stocks are still excessive, according to   the Richmond survey, but the latest survey conducted by Philadelphia   indicates that about one-half of the respondents plan to build their   inventories over the next 6 months. Chicago notes beginnings of   inventory buildup of purchased materials and components, while New   York expects cautious rebuilding of inventories that will accelerate   with recovery in capital goods.
Manufacturing activity continues to strengthen, despite the lack of   thrust from capital goods. Forecasts of steel output for 1976 are   being adjusted upward as a result of completion of inventory   liquidation and better than expected auto, truck and appliance   production, according to Chicago and Cleveland. Atlanta reports   allocation of certain types of steel in the third quarter is likely.   Considerable uncertainty and caution mark comments with respect to   capital goods. New York and Boston see little evidence of recovery   while Chicago, Cleveland and Richmond see some pickup in orders for   non-electrical equipment and machinery, Cleveland reports machine   tool orders continue to rise gradually, while higher than expected   orders for printing equipment, bearings, and certain types of   construction machinery have led to upward revision in forecasts for   those industries. A broad pickup in capital goods is not expected   until late 1976 or early 1977, according to Chicago and San   Francisco.
Construction continues to be marked by strong demand for single-family housing. Multifamily housing and nonresidential construction   remain weak throughout much of the country. Demand for new single-family housing appears strongest in the Southwest, the Midwest, and   Southeast. In other areas, however, the market appears strongest for   existing houses, and only limited or moderate recovery in new   housing is reported. Multifamily construction remains depressed,   although scattered positive signs are appearing in some areas. There   is very little evidence of a pickup in industrial construction, and   St. Louis reports only scattered increases in activity in   nonresidential construction.
Reports from agricultural areas suggest conditions are favorable   despite drought and an early freeze that could affect crop output.   St. Louis, Minneapolis and Richmond report spring planting is ahead   of normal in several areas. St. Louis describes prospects for the   winter wheat crop as "excellent." although Kansas City expects   output this year will be off by about 20 percent from last year.   Expected increases in spring wheat production coupled with a large   carryover of stocks from the last crop year are expected to offset   some of the decline. Kansas City expects that expansion of red meat   supplies during the second half of 1976 will constrain livestock   prices, despite recent strengthening. Pork and beef output is   expected to be about 2 to 3 percent above 1975 levels.
Weak business loan demand is continuing throughout the country, but   consumer and mortgage loans have been strengthening in several   Districts. Philadelphia reports that some banks are more   aggressively encouraging customers to use existing lines of credit,   while some larger banks in the St. Louis District are offering loans   at below the prime rate to larger business customers. Bankers in   Philadelphia do not expect loan volume to increase until the third   or fourth quarter. Sluggish loan demand is associated with ample   corporate liquidity and rate spreads between the prime rate and   commercial paper, according to San Francisco, St. Louis and Kansas   City.
