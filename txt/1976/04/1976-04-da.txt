With the exception of a few problem areas highlighted in this   report, the economic recovery is progressing reasonably well in the   Eleventh District. Evidence of the expanding economy can be seen in   most labor market statistics. Total employment has increased by   100,000 workers in the five-state area in the past year, and the   unemployment rate has dropped to 6.2 percent. Only in Oklahoma has   the jobless rate increased, while in Arizona the rate has dropped   3.5 percentage points. In Texas, insured unemployment has declined   39 percent since last June. Moreover, initial claims for   unemployment insurance are now at the lowest level since October   1974, The recovery in manufacturing in Texas is reflected by the   extended workweek for production workers, which, at 41.0 hours,   equals the annual averages for 1972 and 1973.
The only manufacturing industry in Texas that has not participated   in the economic recovery is primary metals. Output by the industry   has dropped nearly a third since September 1974, but the decline now   appears to be leveling off. A survey of steel companies in the   industry indicates most firms are hoping for a slow pickup in   business later this year, but this outlook depends on the   performance of two major markets—construction and oil field   equipment. Some steel companies note the market for materials used   in small residential construction projects has firmed. However,   total output will not be affected substantially until nonresidential   construction begins a comeback. But even stronger demand for  construction materials may not help the steel industry because as   much as three-fourths of the current production of some firms goes   into oil field equipment manufacturing which is now beginning to   soften. In addition, aluminum output continues at the low level   established last summer.
Domestic drilling activity has taken a turn for the worse. After   reaching a 14-year high in late December, the total number of active   rotary drilling rigs dropped 16 percent to a 17-month low in March.   A seasonal decline in drilling is expected in the first quarter of   each year; but according to some industry spokesmen, the cutback was   also in response to a rollback in the average price of domestic   crude oil to $7.66 a barrel—down from the January high of $8.43.   Many drilling contractors expect the decline to slow and drilling to   begin a seasonal upswing in the last half of the year. However, the   future is clouded by proposed legislation that is unfavorable to the   industry. Despite the sharp drop in rig count, more wells were   completed in the first quarter of 1976 than in the comparable period   last year.
Multi-family construction in the Eleventh District remains severely   depressed by high interest rates and rising construction costs. As a   result, a growing shortage of apartment units, already acute in some   District cities, has caused some major changes in the rental market.   In Houston, for example, where the occupancy rate is 95 percent,   tenant resistance to fast-rising rents, discontinuance of lease   contracts, and payment of their own utility bills has become   virtually nonexistent.
The tight rental market is, however, boosting the demand for new   single-family homes. Sales of new houses are near record levels,   according to a survey of the District's largest tract builders.   Demand is strongest for homes priced under $30,000, and most are   being sold to apartment dwellers. In addition, new developments are   mushrooming in suburbs 15 to 30 miles from the central business   districts because fears of gasoline shortages and the inconvenience   of commuting have been overcome.
Custom builders specializing in more expensive homes are also   experiencing brisk sales. Roughly half the new homes sold in Dallas   this year have been priced over $40,000. And in El Paso, demand for   homes costing more than $50,000 is the strongest in several years.
Farm income in the Southwest will be higher this quarter than a year   ago. Prices received by Texas farmers for all agricultural products   are up 17 percent, on average, from last year. With higher average   cattle and calf prices, total livestock receipts will be bolstered   by increased marketing of cattle from feedlots and increased numbers   of grass-fed cattle and calves slaughtered. Receipts from hogs,   milk, and broilers may also rise. But total crop receipts—reflecting very weak rice and soybean prices—may remain near year-earlier levels.
Prices paid by farmers for most production items have increased 8   percent in the last year. Costs of feed, fuel and motor supplies,   farm machinery, building and fencing materials, and farm supplies   should continue to increase moderately, while irrigation costs in   areas of West Texas and Eastern New Mexico will be significantly   higher. Fertilizer prices, however, are below year-earlier levels,   encouraging extensive application of crop land and improved pastures   where adequate moisture is available.
