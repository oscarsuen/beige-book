Economic activity in the Eighth District continued to expand in   recent weeks according to reports from District businessmen.   Consumer spending remains a strong feature of the recovery as   retailers report improved sales. Manufacturing activity, with the   exception of capital goods, continues to improve, and employment has   maintained its upward course since   mid-1975. Construction activity   is also strengthening. Reports indicate the beginning of an upturn   in commercial construction in addition to further expansion in   residential construction activity. Bank loan demand has increased   somewhat, and mortgage loan demand has decreased significantly. In   the agricultural sector, land preparation and planting are currently   underway for a large acreage of crops.
Consumer spending remains strong, and retailers are generally   optimistic about prospects for the rest of this year. Department   store sales have registered gains in recent weeks and are well above   year-ago levels. Most lines of department store goods are selling   well, including big-ticket items such as appliances and furniture.   One appliance dealer in St. Louis noted a definite pickup in sales   in the past 60 days. Automobile dealers report brisk car and truck   sales in March and a continuation of this rising rate of sales into   early April.
Manufacturing activity has gathered momentum as orders and   production registered increases in recent weeks. A representative of   a local steel manufacturer reports an acceleration in the pace of   new orders among all categories of steel products. Manufacturers of   shoes, appliances, televisions, and clothing report improvement in   their sales. Industries closely tied to residential housing,   including a manufacturer of metal connector plates and paints and   coatings, also note continued gains. A representative of the   aircraft and space industry reported that although commercial demand   for aircraft is sluggish, defense contract work is strong. The only   negative report was from a manufacturer of boxboard which   experienced a drop in demand in recent weeks, after a strong pickup   in January and February. However, this drop was thought to be   temporary.
Residential construction remains a leading sector in the current   business recovery. Residential housing permits have increased   recently in all the major District cities. The bulk of this activity   has been in the construction of single-family dwellings, although   some gains were noted in multi-family units. Apartment construction   in some areas is still hampered by relatively high vacancy rates in   existing apartments.
Other types of construction, which heretofore had been depressed,   are now showing initial signs of recovery. One builder, who last   month gave a very pessimistic outlook for nonresidential   construction, reported a flourish of new project proposals in recent   weeks. These projects included several shopping centers, hospitals,   distribution facilities, and restaurants. Notably absent from these   reports are industrial projects. Several industrial projects that   were only partially completed at the beginning of the last recession   remain unfinished. A few industrial projects, including some   chemical and food processing plants, however, are reported to be   underway.
Employment gains have been a strong feature in the current recovery.   Higher employment levels and lower unemployment rates are reported   in most areas of the District than in the previous month. In some   cases, employers report difficulty in filling certain types of jobs.
Loans have improved somewhat in recent weeks. Larger banks, however,   report that the prime rate as officially stated is somewhat above   the actual lending rate to some customers, and above the rate on   other sources of business funds such as commercial paper. These   banks report that some are offering rates at below the official   prime rate to larger business customers. Mortgage loan demand has   continued to strengthen and thrift institutions continue to   experience large increases in savings deposits.
Farming operations are reported to be ahead of normal for this time   of year, reflecting better than average weather conditions. Reports   indicate that farmers will plant more acres overall than last year.   Considerable uncertainty exists about the amount of rice acreage to   be planted in view of sharply lower rice prices. In general, farmers   are expected to shift some acreage to corn and cotton and away from   soybeans. Wheat crop prospects in the District remain excellent.
