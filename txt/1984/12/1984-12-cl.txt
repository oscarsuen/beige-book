Nevertheless, no one anticipates a return to double-digit gains for the two-month period. Further, part of the anticipated November-December gain will likely be achieved through price reductions as retailers attempt to cut inventories.
Auto dealers report strong sales throughout November for both domestic and imported cars. One dealer, in particular, noted that his November sales were about even with the October level. Typically, his November sales run about 20% below the October volume. Car buyers apparently have not been deterred by reports of weakened economic activity or by anticipation of tax increases. A major auto producer believes that auto sales are still constrained by shortages of GMC cars.
A manufacturer of machine tools expects orders to be slightly higher this quarter than last, with slow growth continuing into 1985. Machine tool orders from the auto and defense industries remain strong while weakness persists in orders from producers of farm, construction, and oil field equipment. Imports remain a major drag on the domestic machine tool industry, and are absorbing about 40% of the market. Japanese producers are reported to be competing fiercely for sales of machining centers and numerically controlled lathes.
A diversified producer of components for capital goods reports that automotive related orders remain solid. Orders for some electronic components have declined but the firm views this as a correction of earlier overbuilding of inventories rather than a decline in underlying demand. Space-related and defense-related orders continue to grow out less rapidly than their previous exceptional pace.
Major steel producers report orders aid production remain sluggish because customers are reducing excessive inventories and imports remain strong. Order backlogs are expected to continue falling throughout this quarter. Capacity utilization in steel production is 50 to 55 percent for integrated producers and 55 to 60 percent for the industry. Prices remain weak because of import competition. Producers expect market demand to be stable in 1985 and their shipments to increase slightly if quotas restrain imports.
As a result of a substantial recovery in listings and contract closings, realtors are reversing their previous plans to scale down operations. Realtors, who are the most optimistic among market participants, now expect that housing activity will improve throughout 1985. Builders expect the rebound may continue to mid-1985 out are not reversing previous plans to reduce the size of their operations. Builders apparently would rather minimize down-side risk and forego potential profits if the housing market rebound persists. In contrast, lenders expect the housing rebound to be weak and brief. Although inquiries are up slightly, mortgage volume has been only marginally increased by lower mortgage rates.
Retail deposit growth has been moderate at district banks in recent weeks. Banks have relied less on large certificates of deposit, but rare on the use of borrowed funds.
