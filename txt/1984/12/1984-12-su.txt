The economy continues to show a widespread pattern of slowing expansion across both regions and industries. Manufacturing output is growing overall, but most Districts report substantial variation among industries. Retail sales growth on a year-over-year basis is sluggish compared to earlier this year. Auto sales continue to increase more than is seasonally normal. Residential construction is still weak, but lower interest rates are leading to some signs of a pickup. Most Districts note steady loan demand overall, although consumer lending is strengthening in some Districts. In agriculture, crop prices continue to fall while cattle prices are rising further. Agricultural debt remains a concern in several Districts.
Automobile sales are above year-earlier levels in each of the nine Districts reporting them. Inventory shortages are responsible for slower expansion in some areas. Availability problems persist, but increased production and recent strike settlements lead many dealers to expect further gains in sales.
Nonresidential construction is generally more vigorous than residential. Several Districts comment that commercial construction is proceeding at a strong pace. New York is the exception with ebbing markets for nonresidential construction in all parts of the District except mid-town Manhattan.
