Economic activity in the Twelfth District continues to slow from the vigorous levels earlier in the year, although many economic indicators remain above their levels of one year ago. Retail sales at major department stores remain healthy, but are at a flat or slightly slower pace than last month. Automobile sales have declined significantly since last month in certain parts of the region, but remain above 1983 levels. With the exception of California, most states in the District have experienced continued deterioration in residential building activity despite the moderation in mortgage rates. Non-residential construction activity, however, remains healthy. Increases in manufacturing employment have slowed and, in a few instances, unemployment rates are up from a month ago. The lumber and wood products industries in the Pacific Northwest remain particularly weak, with continued plant closures and activity levels in some products that remain below those in 1979. Weak foreign demand and large harvests has depressed significantly the prices for many agricultural products, threatening the income and solvency of western farms. Commercial loan demand remained cool but consumer loan demand appeared to be strong, leading some to anticipate strong holiday sales activity.
A similar pattern of growth is observed in the savings and loan industry, although the financial problems of a large Association generated a large savings outflow for total deposits of the Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank District in August and September. Mortgage loan commitments declined in September although total mortgage lending in 1984 to date exceeds the level achieved in 1983. There have been declines in profits for the savings and loan industry as a whole since 1983 as new lending increasingly has been financed by expensive. consumer time deposits.
