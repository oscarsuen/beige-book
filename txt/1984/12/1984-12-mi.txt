Except for some large layoffs in northeastern Minnesota, economic conditions in the Ninth District have not changed much lately. Generally favorable employment conditions have changed little from earlier this fall. Consumer spending appears to be stronger in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area than in other less diversified parts of the district. The pulp and paper and the oil and gas sectors are performing well, while the lumber and plywood and the iron mining sectors are not. Crop farmers' profitability has not improved much, but dairy and fat cattle prices have.
Employment in one of the district's industries has not been stable recently: massive layoffs in the northeastern Minnesota iron mining sector were announced in November. Due to a slump in steel demand, about 4,500 more workers were laid off in an industry which had at one time directly employed 14,500 workers, but which more recently had employed only about 8,000. The latest layoffs are a severe blow to the northeastern Minnesota economy which had been recovering from lingering effects of the national recession.
Sales of general merchandise have not been uniformly strong lately. At two large Twin City retailers, sales appear to have picked up late in November. Both of these retailers report November sales about 12 percent ahead of year-earlier levels, although inventories are still high. This Bank's directors also report good sales in parts of western Wisconsin and around Bozeman, Montana. Retail sales have not been so good in other parts of the District, however. In Rochester, Minnesota, early November sales were generally slow, with smaller retailers doing worse than larger retailers. One Bank director reports small increases at best for retailers in South Dakota, while other directors report a general merchandise slump in many parts of Montana and North Dakota.
Motor vehicle sales, in contrast, seem to be continuing at a good pace in many areas of the district (despite the effects of the General Motors strike). Regional offices of domestic auto manufacturers report that sales rose between September and October. Indicative of this strength, one manufacturer experienced 9 percent higher car sales and 43 percent higher truck sales this October than last. Its inventories are low but still adequate. Bank directors report that car sales in October and November were a little light in South Dakota and about the same as a year earlier in Bismarck, North Dakota.
While housing purchases have picked up lately in the Twin Cities and in some scattered areas, they have been slow in other areas. After falling in August, Twin City home sales rose in September, maintaining a level over 17 percent higher than a year earlier. October sales in Minneapolis maintained the September pace. Sales in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, were good, in part due to the availability of subsidized mortgages financed with mortgage revenue bonds. But Bank directors report that housing starts slowed in western Wisconsin and Montana, and many units remain unsold in Bismarck, North Dakota, and in Rochester, Minnesota.
