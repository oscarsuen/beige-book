A recent report indicates that New York City's employment growth during the recovery extended to all five boroughs, in contrast to past years when most job gains were concentrated in Manhattan. Employment increases in Brooklyn and the Bronx reversed a six-year pattern of decline.
Observers across the entire District, however, report slower absorption of office space in almost all areas, with parts of Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey especially sluggish. Potential renters of office space appear to be taking a "wait and see" stance before signing leases. Observers also believe that plans for many construction projects not yet started an likely to be postponed. The one exception to this softening trend is in midtown Manhattan, where demand is still strong and inventories of rental spaces are low.
