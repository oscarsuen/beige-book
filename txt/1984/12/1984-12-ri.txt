Inventories at the manufacturing level are essentially stable and there is little noticeable dissatisfaction with present levels. Current plant and equipment capacity also remains basically at desired levels, and there is little inclination on the part of most manufacturers to alter existing expansion plans. Prices in the manufacturing sector continue stable, with no significant upward pressure apparent in any sector.
Coal production in the District, as in the nation, fell rather substantially after the BCOA-UMW negotiations were completed. Nonetheless, production, year to date, remains well ahead of last year, and record output is still within reach.
Another segment of the District bringing in an outstanding year is the ports. Although much of the traffic is in imports, activity, particularly at the District's larger ports, has been very strong.
Even before the seasonal kick-off, durable goods sales which sagged in late summer, had rebounded and were making gains relative to other product lines. Although retailers had expressed some concern over inventory levels, their fears on that front seem to have been quieted as well. Part of the improvement in retailers attitudes arose from their perception that sales were doing well despite unfavorable weather conditions.
The improved income position of District farmers is expected to show up in the District agricultural credit picture. The quarterly survey of agricultural credit conditions indicates that agricultural loan repayment rates are improving at District banks. In addition, short and intermediate loan demand is strengthening although the demand for long term loans remains weak. District farmland prices are stabilizing.
Consumers and retailers are confident, particularly since recent sales activity has improved. There remains little concern with the prospect for inflation.
