Strengths continue to outweigh weaknesses in the southeastern economy. With the exception of certain import-sensitive industries, the manufacturing sector continue to expand, and optimism remains strong. Retailers expect healthy holiday sale without excessive pressures on profits. The large volume of commercial construction is helping to offset the slower pace of residential building, and contacts believe that underlying conditions portend a revival in housing next year. Bank loan demand remains on the upswing, and thrift mortgage commitments are above the seasonal norm. Business and convention travel is sustaining growth in lodgings and air transportation, although vacation travel has slowed somewhat. The agriculture sector, particularly cotton and soybean growers, also experienced some late-season setbacks as the result of heavy rainfall and flooding.
Although previously idled workers in Louisiana's petrochemical industry are being recalled, the industry remains weak. However, respondents anticipate chemical production to grow from current depressed levels if interest rates stabilize or fall further over the next quarter since demand for the state's chemical products stems largely from the credit-sensitive auto and construction industries. Drilling activity in south Louisiana continues its gradual upward trend. Over 39 percent of rigs are now working compared to 68 percent a year ago. The region's many paper mills are operating near capacity. Industry spokesmen fear that packaging-related orders may slow as the economy cools, but they foresee ongoing strong demand for computer paper and other forms. Defense and space programs are providing additional stimulus. A satellite assembly facility and a cruise missile plant recently began operating In Florida. A major Mississippi defense contractor expects to add 1,500 workers to its payrolls by spring as naval shipbuilding and refurbishing contracts reach the assembly stage.
Shortages of certain popular models and strike-related sales declines slowed car sales activity in October and the first two weeks of November, but regional auto sales remain sharply ahead of 1983 on a year-to-date basis. Southeastern dealers expect new car sales to continue strong through the first half of 1985.
TourismVacation tourism slowed somewhat in October, but business and convention travel remains strong. Attendance at many southeastern attractions decreased relative to year-earlier levels. For the first time since the beginning of the year, Florida welcome centers registered fewer visitors. However, hotels and motels increased revenues in October due to increased occupancy and steady room rates in most markets. Miami's convention bookings were 20 percent ahead of year-ago levels. Most regional airports, which, like hotels, serve primarily business and convention travelers, had higher passenger volume than in October 1983.
