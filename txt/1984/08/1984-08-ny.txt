Employment gains were registered in most of the District's labor market areas in June, and the number of nonfarm jobs in New York State climbed above 7.5 million for the first time. The improvement occurred across all industry categories but was most heavily concentrated among wholesale and retail trade establishments. Additional employment data suggest that the reported June increase in New York State unemployment from 6.7 to 7.1 percent was probably a statistical aberration as was New York City's increase from 7 to 10 percent.
