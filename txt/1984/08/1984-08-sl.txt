Favorable economic trends continued during July in the Eighth District. Consumer spending, factory production, commercial investment and total employment continued to grow. The outlook is for further, but more moderate, expansion for the remainder of the year. Agricultural crops over a broad area have had near-ideal growing weather.
New automobile sales at seven dealers in the District averaged 13 percent above year-ago levels in the first 20 days of July. Both trucks and used cars also moved well.
The strike at the lead mines, which began at the end of March, continues. Prices of lead are now up about 25 percent from before the strike, but industry spokesmen believe prices will fall quickly if the strike is settled soon.
