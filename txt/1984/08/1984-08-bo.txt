Economic activity in the First District continues to expand. Retail respondents report sales increases both over year-ago levels and over plan. Manufacturers also report significant gains over the year. The recovery among manufacturers has been uneven, however; for some firms business is excellent, but for capital goods producers supplying specific traditional industries, the recovery has been slaver than normal. Modest inventory imbalances seem to have developed in both the retail and manufacturing sectors; in some cases, inventories are too large, in others, too small. Price increases for materials and components are still described as moderate. Mortgage lending, which had been very strong, is reported to be falling, and loan demand at some commercial banks has leveled off.
Two contacts mentioned inventory problems. One store has been marking down and promoting since the start of the year, but inventories, while declining, remain considerably higher than desired. Another has the opposite problemâ€”slow shipments by suppliers have reduced inventories enough to harm customer service noticeably and reduce sales.
Retail prices are rising only slowly. One merchant attributed a modest 4 percent annual average price increase to three factors: market competition, no jumps in prices from suppliers, and their own ability to keep costs down.
Several respondents reported mild inventory imbalances. Inventories are higher than desired for some, a little lower than desired for others. In contrast to some past reports, when respondents stressed their commitment to holding down inventories, statements this month suggest that customer service has risen as a priority.
Price increases for materials and components are said to be modest. Supplies are adequate. Concerns about inflation center around next year's wage settlements in key industries. Also, one executive noted that foreign competition has held down the prices charged by U.S. producers; were the dollar to decline relative to foreign currencies, prices would rise not only for imports but also for many domestically produced goods.
Foreign markets are reported to have improved, at least for subsidiary operations. Business in Canada and Asia seems to be quite good; Europe is mixed and South America has stabilized at a depressed level.
Reports from commercial bank contacts on recent lending experience are mixed, with some reporting continued vigorous growth and others seeing a leveling off.
