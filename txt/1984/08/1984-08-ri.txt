Even within the nondurables, however, there is significant variety. The paper industry has been operating at near capacity for some time, so gains have been restricted. The textile and apparel industry, on the other hand, may be giving ground as inventory building appears to have run its course and import competition continues to intensify. There are also scattered reports of some slack developing in the furniture industry. If accurate, these reports probably reflect slower inventory accumulation rather than weakening final sales.
Despite the appearance of great confidence and enthusiasm on the part of consumers, some areas which rely heavily on tourism have found summer business disappointing thus far. Such disappointment is by no means uniform across the District, however. In fact, analysis of the experience of various areas suggests that perhaps tourists and vacationers are venturing farther from home, at the expense of the areas favored during recent periods of recession and concern over gasoline prices and supplies. Tourist-related businesses in the more remote areas seem much more pleased with their experience this season.
A survey of Fifth District bankers has indicated that financial stress, as measured by foreclosures and/or liquidations of farm assets are well within "normal" levels, indicating that strength is returning to the agricultural economy.
Some businesses are facing what they perceive to be more pressing problems. Foreign competition is among them. Such industries as textiles and apparel and furniture are facing very weak markets for their exports and very strong foreign competition in domestic markets. They are concerned that if costs were to rise, margins would deteriorate since price increases would be nearly impossible. Costs are already reported to be putting significant pressure on margins of producers of a wide range of industrial products and goods, but price increases are apparently not tenable in the current market environment. Thus, while the outlook is for relatively stable prices, producers are very concerned about profits.
