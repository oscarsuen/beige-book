The Sixth District economy slowed somewhat in midsummer, but areas of strength continue to dominate the weaker sectors. Slowing housing construction throughout the region has led to a softening of activity in concomitant industries. Foreign imports are pressuring apparel and textile producers, and the bankruptcy of a Florida-based airline has added to unemployment rolls. In contrast, consumer spending has been strong and bank loans to consumers have grown briskly. Auto dealers report inadequate inventories to meet strong demand. Tourism is outpacing that of last summer, and increasing rainfall has brightened the production outlook for most crops.
Contacts at apparel and textile firms throughout the region are expressing increasing concern over rising imports. Imports reached the highest level on record in May, and industry spokesmen see little hope of a downturn in the near term in spite of efforts to make domestic plants more competitive. Aluminum production is decreasing in Tennessee and spokesmen state that further capacity cutbacks could occur. Inventories of aluminum are building due in part to a slackening of demand from the housing industry. Lumber mills also report increasing inventory accumulations in response to the housing slowdown. Florida's impressive recovery suffered a setback with the bankruptcy of a major Miami-based airline and the resulting addition of 1,200 people to the state's unemployment rolls.
By the end of August, recent federal legislation will provide bond-funded mortgage loans in District states as much as 4 percent below market rates. This should aid construction of low- and moderate-priced housing in certain areas. Even so, builders expect a continuing decline in residential construction in major southeastern cities, where purchasers may have difficulty in qualifying for these subsidized loans.
Commercial construction in Atlanta, Orlando, and Tampa continues its strong pace. Hotel construction is very active in the Orlando area despite concerns of overbuilding in the face of attendance declines at local tourist attractions.
Bank deposits have registered little growth since May, and thrifts in the region have also posted slow or negative deposit growth.
Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) delinquency rates continue to climb in the District. The present rate is a record high 42 percent, representing 21,000 southeastern farmers. Farmers in Georgia and Mississippi are experiencing the most difficulty, accounting for 10,000, or nearly half of total delinquencies.
