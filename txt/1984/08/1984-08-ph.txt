Conditions in the Third District economy are mixed, according to business contacts. Bankers report a surge in savings deposits, and loan demand and retail sales continue strong, though not as strong as in the past few months. On the other side, however, manufacturers report a fractional decline in activity, and real estate contacts see slippage in traffic and sales since June.
Even though current conditions are mixed, forecasts from most sectors are optimistic. Contacts expect growth to continue, though at a somewhat slower pace for the remainder of the year. Realtors expect weak activity until interest rates stabilize, which, they indicate, may happen by year-end.
Industrial price increases are more widespread in July than in the last few months. Forty-six percent of respondents are paying higher prices in July than in June and 22 percent are receiving more for their output this month compared to June. Higher prices for both inputs and outputs are expected over the rest of the year.
Loan demand is expected to remain strong throughout the rest of the year, according to local bankers. Bankers look for increases of 10 percent or higher in C&I loans and 8- to 10-percent growth in consumer lending by the end of this year.
The prime rate, currently at 13 percent at all area banks, was raised from 12.5 percent on June 25. Third District bank economists anticipate slight increases in the prime through the end of the year, to 13.5 or 14 percent, and they also look for the federal funds rate to inch up to 12 percent.
Third District bankers report that retail time and savings deposits are up about 10 percent from this time last year. Time deposits especially are growing, in part because of increases in personal income, and also because of the high cost of holding demand deposits and the relatively low rates being paid on money market deposit accounts.
Realtors are looking for greater stability in interest rates by year-end 1984. They expect stable rates to boost the currently sluggish sales, which, in their view, are due to interest rate uncertainty.
