The pace of economic growth in the Ninth District has moderated. Employment conditions remain healthy, in part due to heavy construction activity, and general merchandise and auto sales are still strong in the district's diversified cities. However, housing activity seems to have fallen off, and the region's agricultural sector is still suffering from declining land values and increasing debt service woes. As a result, both consumer spending and financial activities are slack in rural areas and in smaller cities and towns. The pace of tourism, an important contributor to the Ninth District's summer economy, appears to be varying around the region.
Employment conditions remain good in the district. In Minnesota, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell slightly to 6.0 percent in May, then rose slightly to 6.2 percent in June. Analysts attribute the increase to statistical quirks and to temporary layoffs of nonstriking hospital workers, caused by a nurses' strike which ended in July. In Duluth, Minnesota, fueled in part by heavy public construction activity, employment rose to its highest level in 18 months. Heavy construction activity is also lifting labor demand in parts of Montana, in South Dakota, and in North Dakota. In North Dakota, oil production is also increasing demand. June job placements reached an all-time high at the Sioux Falls, South Dakota, employment bureau.
District sales of motor vehicles—particularly full-size cars—continue to show strength across the district. A domestic manufacturer reports good sales in all models, with its full-size car sales 9 percent ahead of a year ago. Its inventories are about normal for this time of year.
Housing activity appears to have slowed somewhat. Twin Cities housing permits started to fall off in May. While Twin Cities home sales rose sharply in May, they fell off in June. Early reports indicate that sales in July won't be better than they were a year ago either. Slowing activity has also been noted lately in the Dakotas and in Montana, where a lot of home remodeling is being done in lieu of new home buying.
While crop conditions have improved throughout the district, farmers are still suffering from low land prices and high debt service burdens. The corn, soybean, sugar beet, and sunflower crop outlooks have all benefited from drier weather. Because northeastern Montana is still way too dry, though, both crop and livestock income is being destroyed. The federal dairy diversion program and strong ice cream sales are expected to help the district's dairy producers. But this Bank's latest survey of agricultural bankers indicates that local farmland values and farm debt service woes continued in the second quarter.
Deposits at district commercial banks, savings and loans, and credit unions rose at an annual rate of 7 percent between mid-June and mid-July. Most of the growth occurred in Minnesota and Wisconsin. District Bank directors report that financial activity has been slack in rural parts of the district because of farmers' difficulties. One notable event is the purchase of the largest insurance agency in Montana by the district's largest bank holding company.
