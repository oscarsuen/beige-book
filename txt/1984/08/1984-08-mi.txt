The pace of economic growth in the Ninth District has moderated. Employment conditions remain healthy, in part due to heavy construction activity, and general merchandise and auto sales are still strong in the district's diversified cities. However, housing activity seems to have fallen off, and the region's agricultural sector is still suffering from declining land values and increasing debt service woes. As a result, both consumer spending and financial activities are slack in rural areas and in smaller cities and towns. The pace of tourism, an important contributor to the Ninth District's summer economy, appears to be varying around the region.
District sales of motor vehicles—particularly full-size cars—continue to show strength across the district. A domestic manufacturer reports good sales in all models, with its full-size car sales 9 percent ahead of a year ago. Its inventories are about normal for this time of year.
Housing activity appears to have slowed somewhat. Twin Cities housing permits started to fall off in May. While Twin Cities home sales rose sharply in May, they fell off in June. Early reports indicate that sales in July won't be better than they were a year ago either. Slowing activity has also been noted lately in the Dakotas and in Montana, where a lot of home remodeling is being done in lieu of new home buying.
