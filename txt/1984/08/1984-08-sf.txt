In the Twelfth District, the growth of the economy appears to be slowing as rising interest rates and the strong dollar adversely affect certain key sectors. Consumer spending appears to have grown at an accelerated rate in July, with both department stares and automobile dealerships experiencing strong sales. Nonresidential construction activity also continues to pick up. But rising mortgage interest rates have further reduced both the construction and sale of new homes. Employment in the manufacturing sector generally has been growing at a slower rate as the rising foreign exchange value of the dollar has increased imports of lumber and primary metals, forcing Western producers to curtail operations. In agriculture, the prospects for significant improvement in farm income in 1984 have deteriorated further as prices have weakened in response to overly abundant harvests and declining exports. In July, Twelfth District banks experienced a further large outflow of money market deposit accounts, without an offsetting pickup in large time deposits.
In May and June, large time deposits picked up, helping to offset this outflow. But in the first three weeks of July, growth in those deposits slowed considerably. The sharp drop in business loans that occurred during this period, following two months of rapid growth, may be one reason banks were less aggressive in acquiring these funds. Consumer and real estate loans closed continued to grow at their trend rates for the year, with consumer loans showing remarkable growth. But bankers report a decline in residential mortgage loan applications, suggesting that the demand for those loans also is falling.
