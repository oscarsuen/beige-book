Two major tire producers report operating at capacity (running as many shifts per week as labor unions will agree to), and one is purchasing tires from competitors to meet customer demand. Capital spending is being used to improve efficiency. Some capacity is still available at other domestic tire producers, and growth of imports has restrained price increases. Nevertheless, prices have begun to firm and industry sources suggest that another price increase is likely in the months immediately ahead.
A paper box producer reports the industry's capacity utilization is in the mid-90s%. Some bottlenecks have appeared but the industry can increase production a little more before physical limits of output are reached.
A chemical producer reports ample capacity in that industry, weak prices, and little interest in adding new capacity.
The auto industry has plenty of additional capacity to produce some compact and subcompact cars but is operating close to capacity for mid- and standard-sized cars. The industry doesn't plan to reopen marginal plants because they expect demand to ease as the year progresses.
Truck producers report light truck (particularly 4-wheel drive) production at capacity, and shortages of axles because supplier capacity was cut during the recession. Heavy-duty truck production is at 90% of capacity, but one parts producer expects demand to fall in the second half of the year after a special sales incentive has ended. Medium truck production is at 70% of capacity.
The aluminum smelting industry is operating at about 83% of physical capacity. Prices have been flat since September. Demand for aluminum is stronger than demand for steel because aluminum is used more extensively in consumer products.
The steel industry is operating at 77% of capacity overall but production of flat-rolled steel, used in cars and major appliances, is at full capacity, and flat bar production is at full capacity at some mills. There is ample capacity to expand production of other steel items.
Electrical equipment producers are experiencing weak demand because electric utilities have ample capacity and the machine tool industry, a major customer, is having a relatively mild recovery. Producers of electronics are experiencing very strong demand. Producers of electronic chips and chip-making equipment are operating near capacity and are planning capacity expansions.
Two commercial and industrial building contractors in the Cleveland area expressed optimism for 1984. Although the vacancy rate of newly constructed buildings is still relatively high, they expect that tile glut of space will be substantially reduced by yearend.
