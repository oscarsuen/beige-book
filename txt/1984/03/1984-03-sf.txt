The Twelfth District economic recovery is continuing with increased momentum. Consumer spending in the post-Christmas holiday period has been stronger than it has been nationally, with both retail stores and automobile dealerships experiencing large year-to-year sales gains. Western homebuilding activity in January rebounded even more strongly than nationally, and permits for new units point to a continuing high-level of activity. Nonresidential construction spending is really beginning to pick up. In the manufacturing sector, nearly all industries have been increasing production and employment recently, with demand especially strong for defense and business capital equipment. Agricultural crop prices are up sharply from a year ago and the planting season is progressing well. In the deregulated environment, financial institutions have chosen not to compete aggressively against each other for small time deposits but to offer rates fairly close to those of money market funds.
