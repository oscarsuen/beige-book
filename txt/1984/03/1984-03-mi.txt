As the Ninth District's snow cover inexorably deepens, so does its recovery. The most recently available statistics point toward general improvement in the labor markets. Similar to nationally reported trends, consumer spending has continued to be quite strong. Construction and manufacturing activities have generally sustained their upbeat performance into 1984. Agricultural conditions have generally not improved. Financial sector performance is consistent with the pace of the recovery.
Motor vehicle purchases in the district also mirrored the national strength. The district manager of one large domestic auto manufacturer reports that in January car and truck sales were over 65 percent higher that a year earlier. A January survey of Minnesota auto dealers shows excellent sales gains throughout the state, with both domestic and imported autos selling briskly. Many South Dakota dealers had a great February, with double-digit sales gains reported for both new and used cars. Directors' reports from North Dakota and Montana indicate that auto sales have been good throughout the rest of the district, too.
Housing activity in the district posted big gains recently as well. January home sales in the Twin Cities metro area were up 58 percent from January 1983. Growth in that area dropped off a bit in February, but remained in double digits. According to a director, variable rate mortgages are helping maintain the good market in Billings, Montana. Another director notes that a lot of housing activity is occurring in many areas of North Dakota.
