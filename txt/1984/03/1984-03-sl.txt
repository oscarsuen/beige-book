On the whole, economic activity in the Eighth Federal Reserve District has been showing substantial improvement recently. According to the latest data, personal income in the District is rising at about the same rate as at the national level. The strength of the recovery across District states has been somewhat disparate, however, with some areas showing considerably more improvement than others. Indexes of general business activity have been rising at rates ranging from 10.8 percent for Arkansas to 4.3 percent for Tennessee.
Despite the expansion in employment, the District's average unemployment rate has remained, roughly, unchanged. Recently, Tennessee has experienced a substantial reduction in its unemployment rate while slight increases have occurred in Kentucky and Missouri. Unemployment rates in other District areas have been fairly static.
These two factors—growth in employment and a stable unemployment rate—suggest that the labor force in the District has expanded at a rate commensurate with employment growth.
Over the next three months, about 20 percent of the District firms contacted plan to increase employment while only 6 percent expected to reduce their workforces. Most of the expected increase appears to be concentrated in the construction and manufacturing industries. A number of manufacturing firms have had job openings for more than six months that they have been unable to fill with qualified individuals.
The expected increase in sales seems to be placing some upward pressure on prices. About 20 percent of the firms surveyed plan to raise prices and these firms were about equally divided between those planning an increase of less than 3 percent, an increase of between 3 and 5 percent, and an increase of between 5 and 10 percent. Only 3 percent of the firms surveyed plan price reductions.
