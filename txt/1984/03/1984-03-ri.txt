District manufacturing employment also rose sharply from year end, as did employee compensation. Manufacturers are also encountering more frequent increases in prices paid and received for goods.
Price increases do not yet appear as prevalent at the retail as at the manufacturing level, but the elimination or reduction of promotional programs may be a factor. In any event, list prices remain essentially flat. Retailers appear to have done some inventory rebuilding in recent weeks, but remain, for the most part, comfortable with current stocks.
On the residential side, sales are holding up quite well for both new and previously owned units. Figures may be distorted as a result of unusually warm weather in February. However, the overall impression must be that the fundamentals on the housing markets are all positive. By all evidence, construction of new units is accordingly strong. Speculative building is being revived, as expectations of strong spring sales gain support.
