No slowdown is apparent in recent reports on sales and employment. In fact, employment in most regionally important industries is increasing. Consumer spending continues to grow at a healthy pace, although cold weather adversely affected some localities. Bank loan demand softened in late February. Mortgage lending at thrifts remains strong; deposit growth, although modest, is better than usual for the period. Single-family residential construction and sales continue to rise, but excess capacity has slowed multifamily building. Although cold weather reduced vacation travel to Florida, convention travel is improving. Credit problems have yet to diminish for a large portion of southeastern farmers.

The phosphate and farm chemical industries are expanding production in anticipation of an increase in farm acreage this year. Projected growth in phosphate fertilizer consumption ranges from 14 to 20 percent. Mines in Florida, the nation's largest phosphate producer, already are recalling laid-off workers. Louisiana's farm chemical companies, which produce 40 percent of the nation's ammonia-a primary ingredient in fertilizer and pesticides-are adding staff selectively. These reports suggest a continuation of the improvement reflected in labor market statistics for January, when unemployment rate fell in three of the six District states and the regional average dropped to 8.6 percent, seasonally adjusted. However, steadily declining rig counts portend renewed weakness in the oil and gas industry.
The Georgia legislature enacted the Southeast's first regional banking legislation. The law will allow banks and bank holding companies, but not thrifts, to merge with and acquire other institutions in states with similar legislation; it does not sanction interstate branching. Meanwhile, Georgia's Attorney General has challenged the legality of remittance processing centers, or corporate lock boxes, operated in Atlanta by several out-of-state banks.
A freeze in early March, accompanied by high winds, inflicted additional damage on Florida's agriculture. Damage was less widespread than in December, although some vegetable crops suffered heavy losses. As much as 50 percent of the early corn crop perished.
