The Third District economy has shown unexpected strength over the last six weeks. Local manufacturing posted gains in February, and retailers continue to experience surprisingly high levels of sales. In the financial sector, C&I loan activity is finally showing steady growth after months of disappointing performance. And, in the real estate industry, steady mortgage interest rates and some pent-up demand for homes have spurred sales since mid-January.
The outlook for the next six months is marked by general optimism but with a touch of caution. Manufacturers expect increasing activity into the summer and retailers foresee continued strong sales. Both bankers and realtors, however, have expressed concern as mixed interest rate forecasts lead to varied outlooks for the two industries.
Despite less prevalent gains in manufacturing activity during February, the outlook for the next two quarters is even more optimistic than January's. Eighty percent of these surveyed expect their businesses to expand further by July, and the percentage at respondents planning to increase capital expenditures remains encouragingly high. Additionally, over 70 percent foresee continuing gains in both new orders and shipments into mid-summer. The employment picture also looks bright, with roughly half of the survey respondents expecting larger payrolls, and one-third forecasting a longer workweek by July.
Industrial prices continued their pattern of steady increases in February. Thirty percent of the executives polled said they were paying more for materials than in January, while only 16 percent reported receiving higher prices for finished products. The six-month outlook was virtually unchanged from January's; 84 percent predicted higher producer costs by July, and 61 percent anticipated receiving higher prices for their own products.
Retailers say that current in-store promotions are typical for this time of year, but add that the general level of such promotions is on the rise as the industry becomes more competitive in the Philadelphia area. Many report that they are conducting extensive media advertising and will continue to do so in the future.
Looking ahead, merchants are uncertain over late March sales due to the late Easter season, but generally forecast sales to be 10 percent to 15 percent higher than a year earlier over the next six months. Accordingly, inventory plans, even those of traditionally conservative retailers, are very expansive for the same period.
Encouraged by the recent steady improvement in the C&I sector, bankers predict moderate, but consistent commercial loan growth throughout the year, with forecasts ranging from 10 percent to 15 percent above same-period 1983 levels. Financial executives base their optimistic outlook on the continued strength of the economy, rising capacity utilization rates, and an erosion of corporate liquidity. The retail outlook is mixed, however, with buoyant consumer confidence offset to some extent by the spectre of higher interest rates.
Area banks are currently quoting a prime rate of 11 percent, unchanged since August 1983, but contacts anticipate some upward movement in rates for 1984. Most predict, however, that rates will do very little over the next six months as economic growth eases and Fed policy remains steady. It is during the last quarter of 1984 that local bank economists foresee increased borrowing demands, rising inflation, and tight Fed policy driving rates up by 25 to 100 basis points.
Homes in the $75,000 to $125,000 price range in the City of Philadelphia and in the $70,000-$85,000 range in suburban areas are exhibiting the strongest sales. Buyer traffic seems to be split along geographical lines; suburban contacts report that traffic has nearly doubled since early January, while Philadelphia realtors have seen the same number of, or fewer, customers. Inventories of unsold homes have remained at fairly constant levels despite the heavy sales, but contacts note that units are staying on the market for a much shorter duration.
