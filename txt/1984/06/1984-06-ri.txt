Some of the District's major industries are facing significant competition from foreign producers and are losing ground in both domestic and world markets. Among manufacturing industries, textiles and apparel and furniture are prime examples. Both industries have expanded output substantially over the past year, but have lost ground to imports in domestic markets. Coal is the major example in the nonmanufacturing area, having raised output significantly in 1984, but with little or no gain in exports, which fell sharply in 1983. It seems likely that both output and prices in these industries will be constrained throughout 1984 as a result of foreign competition.
There is little feeling around the District that current debt levels represent an impediment to further consumer borrowing. In addition, there is no apparent consensus regarding how recent interest rate increases will affect the pattern of consumer credit activity in coming months.
There do not seem to be major sources of cost or price pressures emerging in District industries. Of course, the coal industry is currently involved in negotiating a new contract, and the recent strength in domestic markets might raise the miners' expectations. Also, major collective bargaining contracts in the apparel industry expire next year. However, inthese cases, as well as in the textile industry, foreign competition is likely to impose some restraint, particularly in the case of continued strength of the dollar.
