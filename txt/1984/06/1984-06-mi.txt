With the exception or the agricultural sector, favorable economic trends continue in the Ninth District. Unemployment rates continue to fall, and both consumer spending and commercial investment continue to grow. Both deposits and loans are up. But the agricultural sector continues to be plagued by bad weather, low prices, and cash flow problems. As a result, smaller cities and towns dependent on agriculture are not faring as well as larger, more diversified cities.
The district is facing some major labor market developments-both positive and negative. Another large bank is moving its credit card operation to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, creating hundreds of jobs, and a home appliance manufacturer is adding a few hundred workers to its plant there. But 6,000 hospital nurses are on strike in the Twin Cities, and a large iron pellet plant in northern Minnesota recently announced that it is planning a shutdown in August.
Motor vehicle purchases are maintaining the strength apparent earlier this year. Regional managers of domestic auto companies report continuing good performance. One of them expects record second quarter sales and has less than two months inventories of both cars and trucks. Another reports this May's car sales up 22 percent over last May's. Recreational vehicles are selling exceptionally will. While generally good auto sales reports have come from the bigger cities in the Dakotas, the picture is mixed in Montana.
Housing activity appears to have firmed after some bad weather slowed it in March. Twin Cities housing permits and home sales rose sharply in April. A leading mortgage banking firm singled out the Minneapolis-St. Paul area as one of the few areas in the nation in which sales were still gaining. Activity has been strong in larger cities throughout the rest of the district, but slow in agriculturally dependent smaller cities and towns.
