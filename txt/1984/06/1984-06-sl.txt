The economic expansion continued during May and early June in the Eighth District but at a generally slower pace and with more exceptions to the upward course. Department store sales were somewhat greater than a year earlier, automobile sales were mixed, and housing sales decreased. Factory orders were up, but at a slower rate as businesses became more sensitive to possible inventory excesses. The general outlook is for further, moderate expansion for the next few months.
Auto sales in the District varied among dealers in May and early June. Five dealers reported sales were sluggish; six dealers stated that sales were strong, with one noting that May sales established a record for the agency. Smaller cars sold better than larger models, and truck sales averaged about 8 percent above a year ago.
According to builders and realtors, higher interest rates caused home sales to slow in May and early June. In addition, there were a few interruptions of construction by strikes which may have restrained sales. Must builders, however, will remain busy for several months filling back orders. There has been some new apartment building in the St. Louis area, financed by insurance companies.
River traffic at the Memphis port during May was about average, while in St. Louis a barge line was liquidated because of lack of business. Petroleum shipments were little changed but grain was slow. Several trucking companies reported that business was down in April and May from a record month in March.
Since March 31, strikes over company attempts to restrain increases for both health benefits and cost-of-living have crippled Missouri lead mining production (nearly 80 percent of the nation's output). The strikes, however, have only had minor effects on the price of lead since there has been a worldwide surplus.
