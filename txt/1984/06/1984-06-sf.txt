In the Twelfth District, the growth of the economy appears to be slowing. Consumer spending continues to display exceptional strength, with both department stores and automobile dealerships experiencing excellent business. Nonresidential construction activity also continues to pick up. But in May, the continued rise in mortgage interest rates further reduced both the construction and sale of new homes. Employment in the manufacturing sector generally has been growing at a slower rate due to the ripple effects of the housing slowdown on such industries as lumber, near full capacity operations in a few industries, and the efforts of firms to hold down unit labor costs. In agriculture, the outlook for significant improvement in farm income in 1984 has deteriorated due to the prospect of excess supplies, aggravated by a decline in exports. In April and May, Twelfth District banks experienced a large outflow of money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) as they held the line on MMDA rates.
