Inventories at the end of May remained at high levels for many retailers, ranging front fifteen to thirty percent above those posted last year. Some retailers view these levels as too high and have responded with markdowns and promotions. Other chains, however, have deliberately increased stocks because strong consumer demand is anticipated.
The District continued to have a greater share of its labor force at work than the nation as a whole. In May, New York State unemployment remained at the April rate of 6.7 percent, and New Jersey unemployment dropped a full point to 5.7 percent. The rate in New York City dropped slightly to 7.6 percent on an unadjusted basis.
Several recent announcements painted to additional economic gains in various parts of the District. Plant shutdowns planned for northern New Jersey and Westchester have been cancelled; instead one plant will be modernized and the other will be converted to mixed industrial uses. In addition, a $100 million plant expansion has begun in New Jersey and on Long Island a $126 million International Design Center project has been initiated.
Non-residential real estate activity was strong in most parts of the District. In lower Manhattan, major institutions continued to seek large amounts of office space, although some securities dealers and financial institutions have been moderating their expansion plans.
Long Island commercial and industrial construction was active, and its relatively low rents continued to lure companies from New York City.
Construction also rained brisk in New Jersey although sizable amounts of space are currently available. Construction in lover Connecticut leveled off, and activity in the northern suburbs of New York remained low.
