The pace of economic growth is continuing to slow in the Southeast. For the first time in several months, job growth did not outrun labor force increases and the unemployment rate stabilized. However, a number of industries remain quite strong, including some textiles, paper, and the full gamut of auto-related manufacturing. Consumer spending, and especially auto sales, is growing briskly, but signs of weakness are surfacing in housing and related markets. Mortgage commitments and lending activity at financial institutions have weakened. Tourism is showing growth from a year ago, but attendance has been far below expectations at the New Orleans' World's Fair. Excessively dry, hot weather again threatens southeastern farm incomes.
Despite the softening of overall labor market indicators, some industries are quite strong and prospects for others are improving. Some segments of the textile industry, notably carpets, are performing well, and the paper industry is operating a 45-48 hour workweek, thanks to a high volume of orders and backlogs. Booming new-car sales have induced a lengthening of the workweek and spurred investment spending at plants supplying the automobile industry. Tire plants are currently on a seven-day workweek and one major manufacturer is purchasing new tire machines in a large modernization program. Moreover, employment at Nissan's plant in Tennessee is expected to expand by 1,000 over the next 12 months with the addition of a car assembly line to its truck assembly operation. By summer's end, 21 of Florida's 22 phosphate mines will be back in production and most workers will have been recalled. Improving oil demand and sharply lower drilling costs brighten prospects for increased activity in the energy sectors of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Summer hiring of teenagers, spurred by the Job Partnership and Training Act and private sector initiatives, has been accompanied by a shortage of applicants for available jobs in the fast-food and hospitality industries.
Nonresidential construction declined by one-fifth in April after rising by more than one-half from February to March. Alabama, Florida, and Louisiana construction slipped most, by 25-30 percent. Birmingham developers report declines in all nonresidential construction, and the completion of large commercial construction projects associated with the World's Fair has slowed activity in New Orleans. Continued rapid growth of nonresidential construction in Atlanta, Nashville, and Orlando mark this region's pockets of strength. Although the planning horizon of developers in these areas has shortened recently, most are going ahead with projects whose planned completion dates are well over a year away.
