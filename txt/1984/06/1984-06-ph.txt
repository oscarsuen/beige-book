Contacts in the Third District say the business environment is still healthy. Although some signs of a weakening of the expansion are appearing. Retailers have posted significant sales growth and bank contacts report continuing healthy increases in both commercial and retail lending. Manufacturers, on the other hand, indicate increases in activity which are softer than those of the first quarter, and real estate contacts have seen a sharp slowdown in sales over the past six weeks.
The outlook for the remainder of 1984 reflects a similar pattern. Retailers and bankers are forecasting strong growth for the rest of the year. Manufacturers anticipate continued growth, but are increasingly less enthusiastic, and realtors foresee a prolonged slump in their industry, barring an unanticipated decline or leveling-off of mortgage rates.
Although respondents are not as enthusiastic as they were in the first quarter, the outlook for Third District manufacturing activity remains bright. Almost half of the manufacturers surveyed predict expansion through the end of 1984, whole only 16 percent foresee a decline. Executives polled expect healthy growth in new orders and shipments, yet predict little change in either employment or inventory levels.
Industrial prices have risen again in June, but, as in May, the percentage of respondents indicating higher prices has fallenâ€”37 percent (compared to May's 42 percent) report paying higher prices this month, while 14 percent (18 percent in May) say they are receiving more for their finished products. The outlook, however, continues to reflect widespread anticipation of hirer prices over the next six months. In June's survey, 77 percent of the respondents are forecasting higher input prices by year-end and 57 percent feel they will be receiving more for their output.
Retailers say that a combination of continued strength in consumer demand and extensive promotions will result in strong sales growth for most of the remainder of 1984, and project 8-percent to 20-percent increases in sales over 1983 levels. Some merchants anticipate a definite easing in the general economy and a respective slowdown in retail growth toward the end of the year.
The outlook for loan activity through 1984 is a positive one. Although contacts express mixed views over whether the current increases in C&I loans can be sustained, the majority feel that demand is strong enough to keep loans outstanding 10-to-15 percent higher than year-earlier levels throughout the remainder of 1984. On the consumer side, forecasts are generally positive, although some bankers see rising rates occasionally interfering with otherwise widespread consumer demand for bank credit. Specifically, they note the possibility of "bargain" financing packages offered by auto dealers cutting into the retail lending market.
The prime rate at Third District banks is currently 12-1/2 percent, up from 12 percent six weeks ago. Interest rate forecasts of local bank economists have changed very little since the last report; most contacts foresee gradually, but steadily, increasing rates through the end of the year. The prime is expected to move to 13-1/2 percent and the federal funds rate to 12 percent by the end of the fourth quarter.
