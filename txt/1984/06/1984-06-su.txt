Automobile sales continue to be strong, although St. Louis notes that sales are sluggish at sane dealers. San Francisco reports auto sales at their highest level since the late 1970s, are being supported by subsidized financing by dealers, and some auto dealers in the Cleveland district say that consumer lending rates haven't risen enough to damp sales. St. Louis observes that small cars are selling better than large cars, and Minneapolis reports recreational vehicles sealing exceptionally well.
In contrast, New York reports house sales and starts are so strong that some builders have "suspended" sales because they are producing at capacity, and Richmond says the trend in housing construction is quite strong.
Nonresidential construction is reported to be strong by San Francisco and New York, "active" by Minneapolis, and down by Atlanta. Dallas reports a decline nonresidential construction.
Atlanta reports lumber prices are falling while Kansas City reports price increases for sheetrock and cement. According to Chicago, a shortage of gypsum board has ended because builders and distributors have stopped adding to inventory. Dallas comments that the high level of construction has some lumber, concrete, and brick plants running multiple shifts.
