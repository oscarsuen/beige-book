Moderate economic growth continues in the Ninth District. Seasonal improvement in the labor market continues unabated. Modest consumer spending gains are reported by most sectors. While residential construction appears to have fallen off, nonresidential construction doesn't appear to have done so. Performance in the financial, agricultural, and resource-related sectors remains unchanged from our last report.
By mid-August, motor vehicle sales fell off a bit from their performance earlier this year. Sales were still more than 12 percent ahead of August 1983, though. One domestic manufacturer reports particularly good gains in its truck line. While a recently established car dealership reports that business has been good, it is worried about problems created by low inventories if auto workers strike. This Bank's directors from around the district feel that, while the pace of new car sales may have fallen off a bit in August, it was still good.
Home sales also appeared to fall off in August. A spokesperson for realtors says that August bookings in the Twin Cities seem to have been slower than in past years. Another analyst says that Minnesota housing market activity probably peaked in June. Condominium resales have been slow in the face of many multi-family starts.

One Bank director reports that early school openings hurt resort business in parts of Wisconsin. The number of visitors to national parks in Montana this summer was from 5 to 10 percent lower than last summer, in part due to the low value of the U.S./Canadian exchange rate.
