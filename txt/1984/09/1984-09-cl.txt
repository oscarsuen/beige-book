Cleveland area auto dealers report strong sales demand continued in August but in early September moderating consumer appetite and inventory problems have resulted in a mild sales slowdown. Dealers say an auto strike at the onset of the 1985 model year would sharply reduce fourth quarter domestic sales. Import dealer outlook for the fourth quarter is more positive because 1985-model deliveries are easing quota-induced shortages.
Builders remain cautious and, except for August, have been experiencing a steady dwindling of their order backlogs. Housing completions were strong during July and August and new orders, which typically are seasonally low, registered unexpected gains because of the bond monies. Also, as a result of bond monies, lenders recorded stronger-than-expected loan volume during August, but otherwise are experiencing a gradual slowing of mortgage originations.
Realtors report an unexpected surge of new contracts in August, principally from homebuyers using mortgage bond monies. Contract closings in August, which resulted from June's sales, also exceeded projected levels by a wide margin. According to realtors, the overall deceleration of housing activity will reverse in mid-1985 if interest rates fall and another dose of mortgage bond money becomes available.
Banks appear to be funding new loans to a large extent by stepping up their issuance of large certificates of deposit and reducing the volume of federal funds sold. Although District banks registered increases in time and savings deposits, these gains were negated by declines in transaction deposits.
