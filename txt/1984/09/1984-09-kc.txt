Demand for mortgage funds and mortgage commitments at savings and loan associations is slowing from a generally robust Spring due mainly to the sizable increase in both fixed and adjustable mortgage rates over the past several months. Most respondents expect mortgage demand to continue decreasing, although rates are expected to be stable or down slightly. Savings inflows are higher than last year, but respondents generally anticipate a zero inflow or net outflow over the remainder of 1984.
