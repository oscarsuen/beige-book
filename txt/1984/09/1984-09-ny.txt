The unemployment rate, seasonally adjusted, declined in both New York State and New Jersey during August, in contrast to the unchanged rate for the nation as a whole. New York's 7.7 percent was slightly above the U.S. average of 7.5 percent, while New Jersey's rate of 6.l percent remained below the nation's.
Nonresidential construction continued at its strong pace throughout most of the Second District. The major exception is midtown Manhattan, where lack of sites and high construction costs are restricting the supply of new space. Observers are looking to new development projects in places such as Times Square, south midtown, and the Hudson River area to provide relief. New York's downtown vacancy rate continues to grow as new buildings are coming on line at the same time as the financial services' industry has been weakening, and demand for in-town back-office has been depressed by high prices. On Long Island, leasing activity remains brisk, but observers are not certain that demand can keep pace with the amount of speculative construction activity.
