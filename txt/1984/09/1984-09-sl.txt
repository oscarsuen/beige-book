Economic expansion continued during August and early September in the Eighth District. Expectations are for continued moderate growth over the rest of the year, and many planners assume that the expansion will continue at a reasonable pace throughout 1985. Department store sales and resort businesses were strong, but residential housing sales were below year-ago levels. Construction remained on a high plateau. Factory production and employment continued to grow, but new orders were mixed.
The Missouri resort industry did an unusual volume of business in the last half of August when normally activity begins tapering off. Weekday attendance at amusement parks, resorts and motels was up significantly, partly reflecting a new Missouri law delaying the start of the public school year until after Labor Day. Traffic was up over 60 percent at one major amusement park, and a large resort reported that its lodging units were 95 percent occupied compared to 60 percent at this time last year.
At several dealers in the District, automobile sales were sluggish in August and early September. Others reported favorable sales and noted that they could have sold more if they still had the popular models. On balance, sales were higher than in the same period of 1983. New cars apparently sold better than used cars. Two dealers were greatly upset over recent factory price increases. Although the average price mark-up was relatively small percentage-wise, the dollar increase was said to be enough to hinder significantly sales of certain models. Small truck sales continued to run slightly ahead of year-ago levels.
Most home builders in the District remained busy, but the volume of unfilled orders has declined substantially. There has been an unusual amount of new apartment building in both Memphis and St. Louis. Nonresidential construction also continued at the earlier fast clip, with the building of many offices, roads, stores, hospitals, warehouses and hotels.
