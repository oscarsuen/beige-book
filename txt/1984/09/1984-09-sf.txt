The Twelfth District economy continues to grow, but at a slower rate due to weakness in certain sectors. Retail sales at department stores and automobile dealerships are reported to have dropped in August, although there may have been extenuating circumstances such as the effect of the Olympic Games and shortage of popular automobile models. Nonresidential construction activity continues to pick up, with additional projects announced recently. But rising mortgage interest rates have further reduced both the construction and sale of new homes. Weakness in certain industries, especially primary metals and lumber, is slowing the overall growth of manufacturing employment. The agricultural sector has been experiencing a dismal summer as overly abundant harvests have brought low prices for fruits and vegetables, and farm land prices have continued to drop. Banks reported strong consumer loan growth in August, but most expected some slowdown.
