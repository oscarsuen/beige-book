The economic expansion appears to be moderating to a slower but still quite brisk pace. Manufacturing remains strong despite weaknesses in certain sectors that have been adversely affected by the increased strength of the U.S. dollar. Defense and energy are the chief sources of current expansion. Retail spending remains generally strong, but several Districts are experiencing a slower growth rate. Auto sales continue to advance in most areas; where some deceleration has occurred, the reason is lack of inventory rather than dampened demand. Consumer spending for domestic travel, however, has been disappointing in some areas because of the high exchange rate of the dollar as well as rainy weather. Residential construction is slowing in most Districts, but nonresidential building is proceeding at such a heady pace in certain areas that concerns about overbuilding are mounting. Lending remains strong primarily because of expanded consumer borrowing. Farm conditions are mixed: several Districts anticipate higher yields and revenues, but poor weather reduced supplies in some states.
Weakness is concentrated in industries sensitive to import competition, but this effect appears widespread geographically more than half the Districts mention it. Industries affected include aluminum, steel, copper, machine tools, shoes, textile, apparel, and lumber. Setbacks in the lumber industry are also attributable to slower residential construction, which is precipitating layoffs by furniture producers and building material suppliers as well.
Summer tourist expenditures are below expectations in most areas. The effect is greatest on attractions; business and convention travel is helping to boost the lodgings and air transportation sectors of the industry. However, St. Louis and Philadelphia report that late summer visitations at certain resort areas were up substantially. Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis attribute the lackluster performance of vacation goers on rainy weather and the strong value of the U.S. dollar, which discourages Canadian tourists from visiting border resort areas and encourages increased travel abroad by Americans.
Nonresidential construction is characterized as surging in Atlanta, Minneapolis, Richmond, San Francisco, and St. Louis. Concern over high and rising office vacancy rates is widespread and mounting, especially in Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco. However, commercial vacancy rates in Minneapolis have been declining, and New York reports low office vacancy rates in Manhattan.
