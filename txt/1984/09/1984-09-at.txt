Economic conditions in the Southeast are mixed, but strength continue to outweigh weaknesses. Industries dependent on international trade continue to be hit hard by the climb in the value of the dollar. Consumer spending remained strong through August, but summer tourist trade fell below anticipated levels of growth. Very recently, declines in mortgage rates have contributed to renewed growth in residential construction. Deposits at financial institutions are also increasing for the first time in many months. The general outlook for farmers is somewhat brighter than in several years, but last winter's freeze devastated many citrus groves.
The outlook for the chemical, energy, and defense industries is brighter. Two large oil companies recently announced plans to build refineries in Alabama. For the third consecutive month, the number of active drilling rip in Louisiana increased in July. Military contracts boosted manufacturing employment in Georgia this year, and job growth is likely to continue through 1986.
Commercial construction in the Southeast continues to surge despite high interest and office vacancy rates. Developers, financiers, and leasing brokers, buoyed by the continued strength of nationwide business expansion, believe demand for office, warehouse, manufacturing, and retail space will increase. However, commercial developers have historically provided more office space than most southeastern markets could readily absorb. Office buildings are the most common type of commercial construction currently in progress, yet most markets have more excess office capacity than any other type of commercial structure.
The full extent of Florida's citrus damage from last winter's freeze is now estimated at $1.1 billion. The freeze, the worst in this century, caused varying amounts of fruit loss and tree damage to approximately 100,000 acres of citrus. Florida's citrus industry is likely to shift further south as growers seek to replant trees, which take five years to reach bearing age, in areas less vulnerable to freezes.
