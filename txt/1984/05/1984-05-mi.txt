Regional auto sales have continued to show the strength evident in previous months. Large domestic automakers report that monthly vehicle sales increased 50 percent between February and April. One large automaker reports that both auto and truck sales were up substantially from comparable 1983 levels and that current inventories are low. Corroborating this, Bank directors report good to strong sales in the cities within Montana, the Dakotas, and western Wisconsin.
While home buying increased in the first quarter of 1984, March sales failed to match the very high level of March 1983. In the Twin Cities, both unit and dollar sales were between 10 and 20 percent below year-ago levels in March, whereas in January and February sales had been between l0 and 20 percent above year-ago levels. Scattered reports indicate, though, that home sales remained good in other parts of the district, including Fargo, North Dakota, and western Wisconsin.
Variation is seen among other loan categories. Consumer loans have reportedly increased a bit in North Dakota and southern Minnesota. However, agricultural lending has been fairly flat, partly because of the higher cost of money in rural areas where incomes are depressed. Banks are keeping fairly liquid in most rural areas of Montana, where few good lending opportunities exist.
