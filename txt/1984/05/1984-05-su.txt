The overall economic picture in the nation is fairly bright, according to reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts, although a few industries are still weak. Retail sales in many Districts bounced back in April from a March slump and are expected to continue their growth. Auto sales are very strong, with near-capacity production levels at many auto plants. Other manufacturing industries are also doing well, especially paper products and consumer durables. Residential construction remains strong, although some signs of slowing have appeared in recent weeks. Bankers in the Eastern and Southern parts of the nation report increases in both business and consumer loans, while borrowing in other areas has remained flat. Probably the weakest sector in the economy at this time is agriculture.
Pork farmers in the Atlanta District have been reducing inventories in response to higher feed prices, but that cutback might be near an end. Dairy farmers in the northern Midwest continue to experience financial problems, and they do not expect much help from the new Federal diversion program. Contacts in Kansas City say this year's calf crop is about average. Poultry farmers in the Richmond District continue to be troubled by avian influenza outbreaks.
Both Chicago aid Kansas City report a further drop in farmland values. Kansas City also says farm credit problems are as bad this year as they were last year, and that farm asset liquidation is likely to increase unless debt is reduced.
The oil industry remains weak. The increase in drilling apparently stems from lower costs and more favorable leasing terms rather than from growth in demand. Dallas says these factors have accounted for a 38 percent increase in the number of offshore rigs since the first of the year.
Nonresidential construction remains generally strong despite concern about overbuilding. In New York and Chicago the demand for office space continues to grow. The market for industrial space, however, is mixed.
Auto sales are also reported to be vigorous. Foreign cars and larger domestic autos seem to be leading the pack, although Atlanta reports healthy sales of compact vehicles as well. Some shortages of the more popular domestic models are reported, and delivery times for foreign cars are being stretched out. Recent increases in consumer loan rates in some parts of the country do not appear to have dampened the demand for cars.
