The business improvement in the Seventh District continues, but the uptrend in retail sales slowed in the early spring and housing activity ebbed, allowing for seasonal trends. Employment has increased further, but gains are still concentrated in manufacturing. Despite sharply higher profits, cost reduction programs are still being pressed vigorously. Output of motor vehicles, paper products, gypsum board, and household appliances is high, often at or near full capacity. Nonresidential construction is showing new life, both private and public. Demand for most mechanical capital equipment has improved, but only moderately. Two major public utilities have serious financial problems, with no resolution in sight. Although leadtimes on deliveries of goods have stretched out further and price increases are more frequent, most items continue to be readily available. Inventory building is underway on a broad front, but appears to be voluntary and in line with plans. Despite evidence of slower growth, most District executives anticipate further gains in a highly competitive environment. Pressures to restrict imports are building, supported by business and labor groups. Farmland values declined again in the first quarter.
Various companies whose sales and profits have increased sharply since the low point of the recession continue to press cost-cutting programs—eliminating marginal and replacing better-paid employees, consolidating functions, selling or closing less profitable operations, etc. In past expansions such efforts often were relaxed. New hirings require special approval, and early retirements are encouraged. Staff reductions through attrition are difficult because, reflecting slack labor demand, quit rates are a small fraction of the postwar average, and the lowest since the 1930s. Also cutting staff are banks, insurance companies, and other financial service companies facing intense competition. The medical field--hospitals, laboratories, and medical supply firms—has been

Interested groups are much concerned about publicity given to recent studies indicating that Midwest states are "inhospitable" to business. Problems cited include high wages and benefits, restrictive work rules, energy costs, taxes, unemployment insurance and workers' compensation, government regulation, and lack of special incentives to locate, expand, or remain in the region. Some charge that evaluation methods of the surveys are unfair and inaccurate, but there is general recognition that unfavorable "scores" have foundation in fact.
Increases in manufacturing employment in the District since the low point in late 1982 compare favorably with increases in the nation, mainly because of callbacks in the motor industry. Nonmanufacturing employment, however, has increased less than in the nation. For both manufacturing and non- manufacturing the District experience compares unfavorably with the nation relative to the 1981 peak or to earlier years. Nevertheless, many factories are working long hours—seven-day weeks, heavy daily overtime, and extra shifts. Major food chains in the District have cut compensation of union workers substantially despite existing contracts. Executives say these moves were necessitated by growing competition from food discounters. Cuts in labor costs have been reflected in lower food prices.
For the first quarter, housing permits were one-third above 1983, and four times the pitiful level of 1982, but less than half that of early 1977 or 1978. Sales of new and used homes slowed in the pest month, except in particularly "hot" markets. The housing slowdown is attributed to a reduction in the overhang of deferred purchases, and concern over the soundness of ARMs that involve artificially low starting rates.
Shipments of steel are expected to continue to rise through the year with a less than seasonal decline in the summer. Demand is strong for lighter steels to be used in vehicles, appliances, and housing, with output at virtual capacity. Inventories are building, on a voluntary basis, but remain low by past standards. Structurals are improving, but demand for heavy plates used in capital goods. remains weak.
Our survey of agricultural bankers indicates that farmland values in the District declined nearly 3 percent in the first quarter, ranging from virtually no change in Indiana and Michigan to an unusually large decline of 6 percent in Iowa. Overall, farmland values were 5 percent below the year-ago level and 18 percent below the 1981 peak. Weakness in farmland values partly reflects asset adjustments by a small number of farmers. The major cause of forced sales has been debt-financed investments in the boom of the late 1970s, at high prices and high interest rates.
