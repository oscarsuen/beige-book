Economic activity in the Eighth District continued to increase in March and April, but the pace of the expansion slowed. Retail sales were moderately strong, but year-over-year comparisons were less favorable than during the winter. Industrial production rose moderately, construction remained vigorous, and employment increased. Farmers have been hampered by wet weather, but expectations of large plantings have stimulated seed, fertilizer and implement sales.
Auto sales have been strong. Several dealers report that March and April sales were 16 percent or more above year ago levels. Dealers claim that sales would have been larger if popular models had been available. Sales of used cars and trucks also have been vigorous.
Rainy weather in March and April adversely affected home sales in the District; they were about the same as in the comparable months a year ago. Industry spokesmen, however, expect total home sales for 1984 to be at least 10 percent higher than in l983. This year's growth in the sales of multifamily homes has been offset by a decline in single family home sales. Prices of homes are rising, but not out-of-line with general inflation. Construction costs have increased with a recent 5 percent wage boost, rising land prices and higher material costs. Builders and realtors expressed concern over increases in the mortgage interest rate: if it rises much more, sales are expected to decline greatly.
