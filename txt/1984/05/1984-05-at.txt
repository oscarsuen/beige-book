The pace of economic growth is slowing in the Southeast. Labor markets continue to strengthen largely because of ongoing expansion in the industrial sector. However, most manufacturers, fearful that the recovery is near its peak, are not initiating plant expansions and are monitoring inventories carefully. Growth in consumer spending has decelerated, but retailers are satisfied with current inventory levels. Rising interest rates contributed to a decline in residential construction in the early spring, but commercial building remains on the rise. Consumer and mortgage lending has slackened. Even the growth rate of business lending, which was strong throughout the first quarter, fell in April. Southeastern thrifts are avoiding sharply discounted adjustable-rate mortgages. Conditions in the travel industry are healthy despite rapid expansion of lodging facilities and the lingering effects of intense airfare competition last year. Pork supplies should not fall as drastically in the Southeast as in the nation, and the outlook for profitability in this segment of the agricultural sector is positive.
Contacts in most industries stress that greater utilization of present facilities is a top priority; plant expansions are infrequent at this time. Many producers, fearing that the recent surge in economic growth cannot be sustained, are maintaining a close watch over inventories. The strong dollar and slow recovery abroad are retarding the growth of manufactured exports from Miami to Latin America and of grain and coal exports from New Orleans and thereby limiting the recovery foreign trade activity in the District. Port officials throughout the region foresee a continuation of slow export growth.
Nonresidential construction, measured in square feet, increased 57 percent from February to March, surpassing the national rise of 39 percent. Overbuilding is a concern in Atlanta's office market. Fears of further materials price rises and interest rate escalation have caused builders in Orlando to decrease speculative building and purchase forward commitments to guarantee current rates. Population growth and corporate relocations are also fostering development, but increased building costs and rising interest rates have spurred builders in some areas to rush projects in progress in case the boon should end soon.
Regional interstate banking is gaining legislative momentum in the Southeast. Georgia has enacted a law permitting interstate banking, and Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina have bills at varying stages of the legislative process. Meanwhile, banks outside the Southeast are taking advantage of a provision in federal bankingstatutes allowing out-of-state banks to operate consumer loan and deposit-taking facilities provided they refrain from offering either business loans or checking accounts. Over 30 institutions have applied to operate these consumer banks in Florida and Georgia.
Air traffic continued to rise in most smaller cities in March, but the Atlanta and Miami airports reported a drop in passenger volume of 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. These declines reflect the elimination of sharply discounted fares, which inflated air travel a year ago. Cruise ship bookings are still slow but on the rise. Anticipating growth, several lines have launched new luxury ships from Florida ports.
