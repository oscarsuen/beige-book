In general, current plant and equipment capacity is considered about right. There is occasional mention, however, of plants or industries facing possible short-term constraints. In particular, the paper industry and some of its customers, such as the gypsum wall board industry, may be near capacity. Isolated plants in the textile, furniture, automobile, and printing industries are also cited as examples.
Retailers do report some inventory accumulation recently, but are generally comfortable with current stocks, as they are with the present number and size of outlets. Also, employment by retailers appears to have expanded over the past four to six weeks.
