The Twelfth District economy appears to be growing at a slower rate than earlier this year but still to be outperforming the nation. Consumer spending strengthened in April, with rising interest rates reported to have had no dampening effect or durable goods sales. Western homebuilding activity has slowed since January, but remains far stronger relative to a year ago than nationally. Nonresidential construction activity continues to pick up, but there is some concern that vacancy rates in office and commercial buildings are rising. In the manufacturing sector, employment and output generally continue to grow but at a slower rate, partly due to the effects of the housing slowdown on such industries as lumber and the near full capacity operations reached in a few industries such as aluminum and paper. In California, agricultural crop growing and demand conditions generally are considerably better than a year ago, but wheat farmers in the Pacific Northwest are experiencing another difficult year. Loan demand at Twelfth District banks has continued at a strong pace despite higher interest rates.
