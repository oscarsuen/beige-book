Business activity in the First District continues to expand. Retailers report satisfactory sales, and manufacturers are seeing a pickup in orders. While the expansion is widespread, it is not uniformâ€”some sectors continue to outpace others. A few supply problems have materialized, but price increases are quite moderate. Demand for bank loans is strong and increasing.
Merchants expected low sales in March because of Easter's late arrival, but sales fell below even modest plans because of consistently bad weather in New England. However, April sales rebounded to bring year-to-date sales back to plan or better. Reported increases for April ranged from 8 to 15 percent on a comparable stores basis. Aside from items the stores were actively promoting or downgrading, no specific products were noticeably stronger or weaker than average, except that one chain sold more lumber and building materials than they expected.
Two retailers have lower inventories than desired because some of their suppliers are not providing promised merchandise. In contrast, one department store's high inventory levels were attributed to excessive ordering by divisions faced with shipping delays. These problems are not serious; none of the merchants contacted planned any significant changes in inventory practices.
Most retail respondents this month reported capital spending plans for 1984 similar to last year. New store openings and remodeling and expansion of existing stores reflect continued confidence in steady regional growth.
Manufacturers are operating with lower inventory-to-sales ratios than in the past. Use of computerized inventory management techniques and, in some cases, simply more attention to inventories have made it possible to reduce inventory ratios without impairing customer service. Several respondents commented that because of lower inventory ratios, their need to borrow working capital was substantially below normal for this point in a recovery.
None of the firms contacted has seen evidence of widespread price increases. Pulp prices are said to be rising, but no other products were singled out. Semiconductors are in extremely short supply; but the problem is lead times not price increases. Wage increases are also reported to be moderate; several respondents expect increases in 1984 of about 5 percent.
