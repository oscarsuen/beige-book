In addition, there are indications that at least some dealers were able to trim promotional activities at year end while holding sales levels and preserving margins. Despite some concern just prior to the holiday selling season, there are few indications that stock outages or inventory shortages presented any generalized problems. With the exceptions of a few lines and an occasional sale item, dealers were apparently able to meet customer demands.
Automobile sales are also reported to have held up surprisingly well over the month. Some import dealers continue to encounter supply problems, selling, as they say, everything they can get their hands on. Otherwise, activity is characterized as robust, but stable, despite a continuing shortage of low mileage used cars.
