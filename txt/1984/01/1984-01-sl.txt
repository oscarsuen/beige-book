The upward momentum of the economic expansion in the Eighth District continued in December and early January. The Christmas season surpassed retailers' optimistic expectations despite severe cold weather in the last two weeks, and after-Christmas sales have been satisfactory. Manufacturing has been improving almost across the board, most transportation companies are moving more goods, and employment has risen markedly since early fall. Real estate sales and construction activity have remained strong despite a seasonal slowing.
With greater production, employment has continued to rise. An automobile company increased its employment by 1,500 in early January, both to staff an additional shift and to reduce overtime payments. However, unemployment rates have shown only a slight decline in recent months as the labor force has also continued to expand.
In general, the financial health of the savings and loan associations in the District has continued to improve. Several Louisville and St. Louis savings and loan associations, however, reported an increase in delinquencies on mortgage loans in December.
