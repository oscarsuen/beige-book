Several companies have recently announced plans to open new facilities in the District. These include a large printing plant in Saratoga Springs, a computer operations center on Long Island, end a factory for producing computer components in the Poughkeepsie area. In addition, a number of companies will soon begin expansion and renovation of their existing operations. The largest of these projects is a $67 million, 2-year modernization and expansion of a paper mill in upstate New York. In most cases these new installations and expansions are expected to generate increased employment.
Unemployment has declined in the Second District in line with the national trend. The December unemployment rate in New York State was 7.4 percent, an over-the-year improvement of l.7 percentage points, while New Jersey's 6.8 percent rate was 2.4 percentage points below its December 1982 level.
The nonresidential real estate market continues to exhibit signs of strength. Leasing of office space has progressed at a brisk pace and generally without significant rent reductions or other landlord concessions. Although nonresidential starts have been scarce, several new plans for future projects have recently been announced. Some of these represent expansions into what are generally considered secondary locations such as the West Side and the area north of the World Trade Center in Manhattan, and north of the Route 287 corridor in Westchester County.
Consumer borrowing remained strong in recent weeks. In particular, auto loan demand was cited as being robust. Some banks reported that strong consumer credit demand has continued into early January instead of the usual after-Christmas slowing.
