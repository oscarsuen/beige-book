Capital spending is picking up. Philadelphia, commenting on its survey of manufacturers, observes that "for the first time in seven years, half of the respondents...intend to increase outlays for plant and equipment during the next six months."

Price increases are reported to be more frequent but, for the most part, still moderate. Lead times are lengthening. According to Chicago, cutbacks in domestic capacity have contributed to the scattered supply problems.
