Strong holiday retail sales, which occurred despite the unusually frigid district weather, indicate continued growth in both consumer confidence and the economy. These sales have been accompanied by heavy consumer borrowing. Also despite the cold weather, the agricultural outlook, particularly in the livestock sector, has improved a little. Activity in the district's resource-related industries has improved as well.
Motor vehicle sales continue to show the soundness evident in previous reports. Domestic car sales managers say that inventories of both cars and trucks were barely adequate at year's end. Sales were up last quarter, especially sales of trucks. One firm's truck sales were reportedly 41 percent higher this December than last. Recreational vehicles are also said to be in great demand. Big cars and pickups are selling very well in South Dakota. Moderate to good sales are reported in southern Minnesota, Montana, and most of South Dakota. Furthermore, special promotions have not been fueling these sales; they instead reflect the favorable economic climate.
To finance this spending, consumer borrowing has been increasing at a good clip in nearly all of the district. A Bank director in rural Minnesota reports that consumer lending has been strong there lately, while another in South Dakota says that it has been fairly good at many hanks. One large district retailer says that its credit sales have been rising, both absolutely and as a percentage of its increasing total sales. Another local retailer reports no problems with its credit accounts. However, consumer lending is still weak in the economically troubled Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
