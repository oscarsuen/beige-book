Area auto dealers report an easing in early-October sales. Low inventory rather than a lack of demand continues to be cited as the major cause of slower sales.
Steel producers report soaring imports and customer inventory liquidation have caused a reduction of orders and production. Together with excess capacity, this weakness in demand has kept transaction prices well below published prices. A major producer estimates it will be late in the first quarter of 1985 before customer inventory targets are reached.
A tire producer reports orders from original equipment manufacturers continue very strong but orders for replacement tires have softened in the last two months. Despite their having operated at capacity for any months, domestic tire producers generally plan no increases in production capacity.
Mortgage lenders report considerably fewer applications in the third quarter than in the second, with applications in September ranging from 20 to 40 percent below expected levels. Lenders indicate that high mortgage rates have softened demand considerably, and a recent slight drop in mortgage rates had no effect on borrowing. Unlike in any other parts of the country, mortgage borrowers in this area seem to be particularly cautious about adjustable rate mortgages.
Evidence suggests that district banks used borrowed funds to accommodate much of the recent loan growth. Although savings deposits increased, banks experienced a greater decline in transaction deposits.
