The Southeast's economy continues to progress in spite of nagging difficulties in several areas. The strong dollar and high mortgage interest rates have retarded manufacturing employment growth and dampened somewhat the region's usually dynamic housing industry. Inadequate dealer stocks of popular automobile models and drought-reduced crop yields have countered the general expansion. On the positive side, steady consumer spending continues to be the principal impetus behind the region's growth, followed by swelling defense-related payrolls, strong commercial construction and a rebound in housing, and improving tourism.
In contrast, defense and related industries are boosting payrolls throughout the region. Shipyards doing Navy work, high-tech electronic firms and aerospace companies are all experiencing rapid growth. Appliance producers expect their record-breaking sales to continue through year-end. Oil and gas drilling activity should remain strong in the months ahead and show signs of increasing stability. Carpet manufacturers report strong sales, especially for commercial use.
A low inventory of popular models weakened auto sales during August and September, according to car dealers throughout the region. Although August car and truck registrations in the Southeast fell sharply from previous months, year-to-date figures were 19 percent ahead of the same period last year. A major auto producer's sale in the region and the nation advanced 10 and 18 percent, respectively, in the first nine months of 1984 compared to 1983.
Air traffic remains strong at most District airports. Contacts cite renewed travel interest following the Olympics and ideal weather as two main factors contributing to the overall high level of tourism activity in the District. The start of the school year has not dampened travel to the extent expected.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects a larger domestic supply of orange juice this year than in the 1983-84 season. The Florida crop is expected to be about 30 percent smaller than in 1980-81, the last year without freeze damage. Citrus canker has not yet been found in bearing groves but was discovered in a seventh Florida nursery.
