The economic expansion has slowed in most districts, but a resurgence in consumer spending suggests that the slowdown may only be a pause in a recovery that has not run its full course. With the exception of Boston, which reports a continuation of steady growth, the districts report moderating economic recoveries in the third quarter. Slower growth has been especially apparent in residential construction and manufacturing activities. Agricultural conditions are mixed. Generally, crop conditions continue to improve, but low prices are expected to keep most districts farm income depressed. There is a very bright spot, though, in the economy. Consumer spending in September and early October was robust throughout the country. These developments in real economic activity are reflected in financial conditions: business loans have been somewhat weak, while consumer loans have been strong.
