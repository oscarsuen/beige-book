The Twelfth District economic expansion has cooled dramatically. In September and early October, retail sales at department stores and automobile dealerships are reported to have shown no significant improvement from August's reduced pace. Nonresidential construction activity is reaching boom proportions in key metropolitan areas. But the recent slight reduction in mortgage interest rates has been insufficient to prevent both the construction and sale of new homes from falling further. The strong U.S. dollar, and consequent increase in lower-priced foreign imports, is hurting such key Western industries as lumber and primary metals, reducing the overall growth of manufacturing employment to a crawl. Prices for important Western agricultural products continue to fall, increasing the debt position of many farmers. Business loan demand at many District banks sagged during the third quarter, and only large banks expect a pickup in coming months.
