Consumer spending continued at a brisk pace during September and early October in the Eighth District, but home sales were down and most other sectors of the economy experienced little change. Expectations by most respondents are that consumer spending will remain strong for the remainder of the year and that manufacturing, transportation and employment will rise moderately, while construction is likely to drift lower.
Auto demand remained strong in most parts of the District during September and early October. In the last week of September, however, sales became somewhat sluggish. Seven dealers reported sales 11 percent higher in September than in the same month a year ago, and early October was nearly as good. Reflecting the strong demand and a continued shortage of popular models, effective new car prices increased at the retail level.
Realtors and developers reported that single-family housing sales in September and early October were about 25 percent below the comparable period of 1983, and new housing starts declined further. In some smaller towns, the real estate market was virtually dormant. The volume of construction activity, both residential and nonresidential, however, remained on a high plateau although some softness is beginning to appear. A building material business continued to operate at capacity, which its owner expected would continue through the end of the year.
The availability of hogs for slaughter continues to surprise the market and should dampen what were expected to be sharp increases in red meat prices during the fourth quarter. Higher numbers of hogs for slaughter, however, also are responsible for low prices to farmers; recent prices for feeder pigs were only 1 percent above the 1983 average.
