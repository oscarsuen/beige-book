Manufacturers' inventories have been essentially flat recently, and there appears to be only scattered concern that they might be excessive. Plant and equipment is largely in line with perceived needs, although there is decidedly less optimism among District manufacturers than in recent months. Prices at the manufacturing level are practically flat.
Housing activity is by most indications, making a comeback after a brief respite. Once again, major strength seems to be concentrated in and around the metropolitan areas, but that has been the case, more or less, throughout the recovery. All in all, housing construction and sales are at or near the levels reached earlier in the year.
Consumers and retailers, on the other hand, are seen as confident and still holding to positive expectations, at least for the remainder of the year. Retailers are described as cautious with regard to inventories, but indications are that inventories are adequate to support continued strength in sales. Retailers are not, apparently, inclined to risk losing sales on this account.
There is little sense that inflation poses any near term threat. Prices are expected to rise only very little in coming months.
