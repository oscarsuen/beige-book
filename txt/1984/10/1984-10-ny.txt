The cost of electricity on Long Island is of growing concern. The state Commerce Department reports that 400 firms have threatened to close or relocate in response to recent and expected future rate hikes associated with the Shoreham nuclear plant.
The office leasing market softened considerably in parts of the Second District. High levels of speculative construction are still taking place despite sluggish demand in areas such as Fairfield County and northern New Jersey. On Long Island, in spite of electricity rate fears, demand is fairly strong but some observers question whether it will be sufficient to absorb the large amounts of space coming on line. The market in Midtown Manhattan continues to be very active, and the likelihood is increasing that prime space will be scarce and rents will rise by year-end. Downtown, concern about potential oversupply seems to have abated. Demand seems stable, and very large blocks of space are scarce. Still, observers predict longer phase-in periods for recently announced construction projects.
