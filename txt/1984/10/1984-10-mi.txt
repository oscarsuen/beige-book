Modest growth continues in the Ninth District. Unemployment rates and other labor market indicators seem to have improved lately. Some growth in consumer spending is reported, but not for homes. Also reported are scattered signs of commercial and industrial expansion. Indicators of recent financial activity are mixedâ€”strong in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, but weak in the rural areas, where farmers are facing low prices.
Mirroring reports for the nation, motor vehicle sales in the district seem to have picked up a bit since August. In September, a domestic manufacturer was surprised to find both its car and truck sales in this region up substantially over year-earlier levels. District inventories of vehicles are still low. Some Bank directors in agriculturally dependent areas report that cars and trucks have been moving well there, too.
Home purchases, while still up from levels of a year ago, appear to be falling off. Both Bank directors and district realtors indicate that housing affordability has deteriorated, with high financing costs, prices, and taxes mentioned as factors. Mortgage revenue bonds are helping to prop up sales in parts of western Wisconsin, though.
Tourist spending in the district, which may have been somewhat more restrained this summer than last, picked up with the arrival of the fall color season. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the season started early and is lasting longer than expected. Travel to parks in Montana and the Dakotas has been lower this year than last. While some attribute this to exchange rates inducing Canadians to stay home, in fact more Canadians appear to be crossing the border this year. Canadian tourist dollars appear to be flowing elsewhere than parks.
