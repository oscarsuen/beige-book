Eleventh District economic activity showed signs of contracting in September and early October. Manufacturing activity declined, and retailers reported slower than expected sales. Construction and real estate conditions remained weak, with continued softening in the market for single-family homes. There was no change in financial services activity, and energy activity has not increased with higher oil and natural gas prices. Agricultural conditions have been favorable.
Contacts were significantly more pessimistic about the outlook for growth through the rest of the year, citing concerns about war, terrorism, the dockworkers' strike on the West Coast, declining stock market, and upcoming elections. This widespread uncertainty is leading consumer spending and business investment to be put on hold, they say.
Price declines were also reported. Retailers say selling prices have dropped over the past few weeks. Home prices have also fallen in some areas. Contacts in the temporary service industry report downward pressure on wages. Chemical producers said the series of price increases for plastic products have come to an end and, for some products, there is pressure for price reductions.
The slow improvement that had been reported in the high-tech industry over the summer has dissipated in the past few weeks. Demand has improved for components that go into some consumer products, such as cell phones and personal digital assistants. But personal computer demand remained weak, and contacts say the fight for market share is stiff. Layoffs continue, particularly in the telecommunications industry.
Demand for petrochemicals has flattened. Poor profits and growing inventories of heating oil led refiners to cut back production along the Gulf Coast. Hurricane Lili briefly closed a number of refineries and stopped crude deliveries to the region.
Demand for transportation services is still very weak. Airlines reported that the conditions in the industry are bad and getting worse, as the airlines try to adjust capacity to meet demand. The carriers with labor union contracts reported the most difficulty, because they are unable to lower fixed costs fast enough. Leisure travel over the holidays looks promising they say, but business travel is very weak and there are no signs of a rebound. Trucking firms say demand is 30 percent below a year ago.
