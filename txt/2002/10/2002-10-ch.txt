Reports from Seventh District contacts generally suggested that economic activity softened in September and early October. Consumer spending weakened, and many contacts noted that consumer sentiment had deteriorated somewhat. Home sales remained robust, while nonresidential activity was again weak. Manufacturers' reports indicated that the sector's activity slowed in recent weeks. Lending activity was again mixed, with strong household loan demand, but weak business loan demand. Labor markets softened somewhat as businesses were reluctant to hire. Crop conditions varied widely across the District, but forecasts generally suggested a lower overall harvest than last year. Upward wage and price pressures remained subdued for the most part, but reports of increasing insurance costs persisted. Through mid-October, the West Coast dock situation had had a limited impact on the District's economy.
