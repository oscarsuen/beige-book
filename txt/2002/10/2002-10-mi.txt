Ninth District economic activity during September and early October was slow. Consumer spending was weak, and energy and commercial construction activity were down. Agriculture and mining were mixed, while manufacturing, residential construction and tourism grew. Over this period labor markets were soft. Overall, price and wage increases were modest, but significant price increases were noted in trucking and insurance.
Activity in home building and residential real estate was solid. The number of planned units in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area was 26 percent higher in September compared with a year ago, primarily due to strong growth in multifamily housing projects. However, the vacancy rate for apartments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area increased to 5.2 percent during the third quarter, up from 2.5 percent a year ago. A bank director reported strong recent home construction activity in southwest Montana; however, several construction firms noted reduced bidding activity for 2003 projects.
District mall managers reported soft sales for September. Traffic and sales at a Minneapolis area mall were down in the low single digits in September compared with a year ago. Another Minneapolis mall reported sales down about 5 percent in September from a year ago due to recent expanded local retailer competition. Sales at a North Dakota mall were down during the first week of September compared with a year ago; however, they rebounded during the rest of the month.
Recent auto sales were steady to down slightly from the previous report, according to representatives of auto dealer associations. In North Dakota, sales were steady in September, while in South Dakota a majority of dealers reported good September sales, but October started slow compared with late summer. Car and truck sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area were soft in September, but trucks were selling well in other parts of Minnesota.
Fall tourism activity was solid in several parts of the District. A South Dakota tourism official in the Black Hills area reported tourism-related visits and sales up 12 percent to 15 percent in September compared with a year ago. Visits to Mount Rushmore were on a record-setting pace. Fall tourism traffic and inquiries were on par with a year ago, according to a chamber of commerce official in northwestern Wisconsin. However, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, some tourism businesses predicted that the year will finish lower than 2001.
In contrast, a national bank announced plans to add 120 full-time jobs at its St. Cloud, Minn., facility during the coming year. A retailer in Sioux Falls, S.D., plans to hire as many as 700 new employees during October for a new store.
Wage increases were moderate. Wages for District manufacturing workers increased less than 2 percent for the three-month period ending in August compared with a year ago, the smallest increase in over 10 years. A Minnesota city employees' union ratified a new contract that provides a 3 percent increase in pay each year for two years.
Increases in prices were also reported as moderate, with the exception of significant price increases in trucking and insurance. A Montana bank director noted modest increases in overall prices. Trucking rates recently increased about 6 percent to 8 percent from a month earlier, according to a representative of a major trucking company. In  2003, family health insurance costs will increase 20 percent and 38 percent, respectively, from 2002 at two large Minnesota companies.
