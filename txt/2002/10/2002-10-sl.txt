The Eighth District economy has shown signs of improvement                   since the last report. Several manufacturers report an increase                   in orders and production over last year, with plans for new                   investment in technology and expansions. The services industry                   continues to grow, with activity picking up in freight hauling.                   Retail and auto sales have leveled off in October, and some                   retailers foresee the need to offer future incentives. Residential                   sales and construction continue to increase in the District.                   The commercial real estate markets appear to have improved moderately                   in some locations. Commercial construction, however, remains                   slow. Loan demand at small and midsized District banks was up                   in the third quarter, particularly for real estate loans. In                   the agricultural sector, recent storms had mixed effects, damaging                   some crops but benefiting pastures. Harvest conditions for several                   crops are reported to be lagging last year's pace.
A few electric energy plants in the District have halted construction, anticipating weak prices in the near future and an increased need for cash flow.  Contacts note that freight hauling has picked up considerably and that sales of heavy trucks are strong.  A few logistics and distribution companies have announced plans to expand operations in the District.  After strong sales in September, several auto dealers report that sales of new automobiles have tapered off in October.  Discount retailers in the District continue to have stronger sales than general retailers.  Reports from clothing retailers indicate slow sales and low traffic.  Several retailers expect to offer sale discounts to excite customers.  Business owners continue to voice concern over the rising cost of health care insurance, which is pushing up labor costs.
In St. Louis, contacts note that there is positive absorption in the industrial market, especially for bulk space, and that there is a trend in the office market toward newer, better buildings.  In Memphis, positive absorption rates indicate that the commercial real estate market is doing relatively well, as newly occupied space has increased in net terms.  Despite the improved market for commercial real estate, commercial construction remains weak.  In Memphis and St. Louis, in particular, contacts report a slowdown in the market.  In Little Rock, however, commercial construction was good this summer, but not as good as the summer of 2001. Private construction is picking up slowly in Louisville, where government construction remains good.
The corn crop harvest in the southern portion of the District is virtually complete while the harvest in the northern portion is behind last year's pace in all states except Missouri.  The harvest of the District's soybean crop is also behind 2001 levels in all states except Missouri and Tennessee.  Similarly, the harvesting of cotton, rice, and tobacco all lag last year's pace.  Corn and soybean yields, hurt by a lack of moisture during critical periods this summer, are expected to be lower in most District states.
This fall producer cash flows could be squeezed by a decline in government payments under the new farm law, as counter-cyclical payments for grains or oilseeds are unavailable because projected prices exceed the benchmark level.  In contrast, cotton and rice farmers can now request government payments because prices for their crops will be below the benchmark level.
