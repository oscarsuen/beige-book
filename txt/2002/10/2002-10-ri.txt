Economic growth in the Fifth District remained               moderate in September and October, tempered by declining manufacturing               output and sluggish retail sales. Manufacturing shipments, new orders,               and employment fell in September, extending a pullback that began               the previous month. In general, activity in the services sector               expanded at a somewhat quicker pace but growth in retail sales remained               spotty. Home sales continued to increase, as mortgage interest rates               trended downward, but leasing activity in the District's commercial               real estate sector was flat. Price inflation remained in check throughout               the District's economy. In agriculture, crop harvesting was underway,               but the prolonged drought led to lower yields in most areas.
Fifth District commercial realtors reported generally flat leasing activity in recent weeks. A contact in Raleigh, N.C., noted that when it came to leasing, "the word on the street was slow and cautious." Vacancy rates edged higher in all commercial segments, though the increase was smallest for retail space. Reflecting soft demand, rental rates edged lower across all markets and landlord concessions became more commonplace. A realtor in Columbia, S.C., reported that property owners had become "more open to negotiations in recent weeks." On a brighter note, realtors in Raleigh, N.C., and Northern Virginia reported a smattering of build-to-suit projects in the industrial and retail markets. Contacts from both sectors noted that the space was procured for local, not national clients.
