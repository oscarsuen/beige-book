According to contacts, the Sixth District's                   economy continued to display sluggishness during September and                   early October. Retail sales were at around year-ago levels and                   auto sales have been disappointingly low. The strength in low-                   and mid-priced housing markets continued, but sales of higher                   priced homes remained weak in many areas, and the demand for                   office and industrial space continued to be lackluster. Industrial                   activity was generally subdued apart from the defense and automobile                   sectors. Contacts from the tourism and hospitality sector reported                   weaker-than-expected results for the summer. Labor market conditions                   were largely unchanged, while price pressures remained limited.
By most accounts, September car sales results were lower than expected and had fallen below weak year-ago levels in some areas.  Dealers reported both softer traffic and sales, particularly during the first part of September when financing incentives on 2003 models had been more limited.  New car registrations in the District through August lagged the nation and were moderately below levels for the same period last year.
As before, health care costs continue to escalate and this has cut into business profits, whereas higher co-pay levels has reportedly lowered non-healthcare household spending.  Steel prices remain high for suppliers in the auto industry and others.  Local lumber prices slumped in early October after rallying earlier in the year.
