Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicate                 that economic activity grew modestly in September and early October.                 Upward price and wage pressures remained muted overall. Sales                 of automobiles and smaller retail items slowed a bit, and service                 providers reported mixed conditions across sectors. Demand for                 most manufactured items remained weak, due in part to limited                 spending on capital equipment; however, orders and sales for some                 products, such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, grew further.                 Agricultural contacts noted good yields and sales for most crops.                 Although some agricultural producers faced increased shipping                 costs due to the recent work stoppage at West Coast ports, the                 effects of the work stoppage on other sectors were limited. Demand                 for commercial real estate remained soft, and home sales cooled                 a bit in some areas but remained at very high levels. Financial                 institutions saw continued weak demand for business loans but                 strong household loan demand, spurred largely by mortgage refinancing.
