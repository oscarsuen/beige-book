Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicated that economic activity continued to contract slightly in late November and December.  Respondents reported steady or declining prices for most goods and services and little wage pressure.  Holiday retail sales generally were lackluster, with some retailers faring better than others.  Demand for travel and tourism stabilized in recent weeks, largely due to increased leisure travel.  Manufacturing activity remained weak, although producers of some high-tech products noted a pickup in demand.  District agricultural conditions showed little change during the recent survey period, as low prices and ample supplies continued to depress profits.  Demand for residential real estate cooled slightly but remained at high levels.  In contrast, conditions in commercial real estate markets deteriorated further, damping construction activity in many areas of the District.  Falling loan demand, softening asset quality, and declining interest rate spreads characterized conditions among District financial institutions in recent weeks, but overall the industry remains healthy.
Rising unemployment continued to ease wage and salary pressures throughout the District.  Contacts noted that starting salaries for low- and medium-skilled workers have returned to early 2000 levels, and that starting salaries for information technology jobs have fallen by 15 to 20 percent over the past year.  Contacts in information technology, banking, and legal services reported the elimination of hiring bonuses, decreased moving allowances, and more limited merit increases.  A number of contacts indicated that employees are being asked to pay a larger share of health care costs than in past years and to accept more limited health plan options.
Travel and tourism providers reported modest improvement in airline, rental car, and hotel bookings in late November and December relative to September and October.  Hotel industry contacts noted that occupancy rates stabilized in recent weeks, but remain well below year-ago levels.  Although tourism around markets largely accessed by car such as Arizona, Southern California, and ski areas in Northern California and Utah continued to outperform markets dependent on air travel such as Hawaii, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, the gap closed somewhat compared to the previous survey period.  The improvement in travel and tourism bookings was almost entirely in the leisure travel market where consumers have responded to lower prices.  In contrast, contacts throughout the District reported ongoing restrictions on nonessential business travel, due largely to the weak economy.  Despite the pickup in leisure travel, heavy discounting continued to depress profits in the industry.
With the prices of most energy commodities falling, natural gas and oil producers have begun to reduce drilling activity.  In addition, interest in siting and building electrical power plants  has slowed, with some developers backing off their "fast track" approach and taking a more wait-and-see attitude.
