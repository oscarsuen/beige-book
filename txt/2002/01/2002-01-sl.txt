Economic activity in the District continues to be weak, particularly in the manufacturing sector.  A small number of manufacturing industries, however, have begun to recover.  Retail holiday sales were about the same as last year's and were buoyed by promotions and extended store hours.  The residential real estate sector remains relatively strong, although weakness continues in some parts of the District.  New housing permits continue to be issued at a higher level than a year earlier.  Commercial real estate markets have continued to be stagnant throughout the District, although commercial construction has been expanding in some areas.  Credit standards for commercial loans have been tightening, particularly for commercial real estate loans.  Deposits at banks rose through the fourth quarter along with mortgage volume and mortgage delinquencies.
The District's holiday sales were slightly below expectations, although in line with sales for the same period last year.  Numerous retailers used holiday promotions and longer store hours to lure customers.  Apparel, toys, and jewelry were slow movers, while music, video, and home entertainment products have sold well.  Travel and logistics companies are still recovering from the demand reductions following September 11th, while sales for grocery stores, hair salons, and dry-cleaning services remain steady.  Despite the weakness in retail sales, one major retailer in the District has announced an aggressive expansion that includes the addition of several stores.
Residential construction opportunities remain strong in most of the District, as November year-to-date permit levels were higher than a year earlier.  Commercial construction opportunities have begun to expand in parts of the District.  For example, several companies have announced plans to construct manufacturing and production facilities in western Kentucky and southern Illinois.  Also, state and local governments in Kentucky and southern Indiana have awarded infrastructure contracts for highways, bridges, and water treatment facilities.
According to contacts, demand deposits and time deposits increased moderately between October and December, while mortgage volume rose following reductions in interest rates.  Contacts at local banks in Louisville report increased provisions for loan losses due to an increase in the number of mortgage delinquencies.
