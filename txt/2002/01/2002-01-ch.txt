Economic activity in the Seventh District was again soft           in December and early January, with scattered reports of improvement           in a few sectors. Most retailers failed to meet their holiday sales           goals, despite heavy discounting and extended shopping hours. Residential           construction and real estate activity picked up somewhat toward the           end of 2001, while softness in the nonresidential segment persisted.           Despite progress in working down inventories, industrial production           remained weak in the District. Overall loan demand softened toward the           end of the year as higher mortgage interest rates put a damper on new           mortgage refinancing activity, and business borrowers stayed on the           sidelines. Labor markets were relatively weak, but the rate of job losses           appeared to be waning in some areas. Upward pressure on wages and prices           continued to ease due to the general economic slowdown.
