December vehicle sales were mixed. Car sales were               reported to have declined sharply for some makes and models, but               there were gains in light truck segments and for popular SUV models.               Meanwhile, used car dealers reported large inventories and weak               prices.
Commercial real estate markets have changed little               since our last report, with conditions remaining weak in most areas.               Vacancy rates increased in some markets, and the increasing abundance               of sublease space across the District kept absorption low. Construction               levels have slowed considerably over the year, and current commercial               construction is dominated by build-to-suit and government projects.
