The Tenth District economy remained relatively weak in December and early January.  Manufacturing activity declined further, construction and real estate markets eased, and energy activity continued to fall.  Holiday retail sales, however, were slightly higher than a year ago in much of the district, and tourism activity in Colorado was especially strong over the holidays.  In the farm economy, concerns spread about dry conditions throughout the district.  District labor market conditions were similar to the previous survey, with most firms having few difficulties hiring workers.  Wage pressures were virtually nonexistent, and there were some reports of wage and benefit cuts.  Retail prices fell slightly with heavy holiday discounting, while prices for most manufacturing and construction materials were unchanged.
