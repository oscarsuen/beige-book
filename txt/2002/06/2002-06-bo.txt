Economic conditions               are improving in the First District, according to most business               contacts. Manufacturers report that their business is firming or               improving compared with recent quarters. Most retailers say sales               are picking up, software and IT firms indicate that demand is up               either modestly or substantially, and staffing firms cite modest               signs of recovery. The region's commercial real estate markets,               by contrast, remain in the doldrums.
Some retailers report an increase in employment,                 while others are holding employment level. A tourism contact indicates                 that hotels are hiring back service workers who were let go in                 late 2001. An auto retailer has been hiring in all areas of business.                 Wage rates are mostly level among retailers, with one company                 budgeting a 3 percent increase for its fiscal year beginning June                 1. Vendor prices are said to be fairly stable. Selling prices                 are holding steady, although hotel rates are down 15 percent compared                 to a year earlier. Most firms are increasing their emphasis on                 promotional sales, rebates, special pricing, and added value.
The contacted retailers are expecting their                 businesses to improve in the next six months. Most respondents                 feel positive about the future of the economy, with a few foreseeing                 no change. One contact says, "Despite the economy being a little                 wobbly, I think things will improve."
Many contacts cite signs of slightly improving                 demand in the last month or two. For example, a paper products                 manufacturer indicates that business customers are replenishing                 their inventories. A manufacturer of corporate gift products is                 getting more requests for quotes, and a maker of business uniforms                 has seen a pickup. A furniture maker says store traffic appears                 to be increasing.
In contrast to the general tone, some lines                 of business remain stagnant or are slowing. An aircraft components                 manufacturer says business is down considerably from a year ago                 and below plan. Other firms supplying travel- and transportation-related                 nondurables or services say volumes remain below what they were                 prior to September 11. One equipment maker reports that financial                 services firms have cut their purchases, while another says biotech                 and pharmaceutical firms are increasing their purchases at a lower                 rate than forecasted.
Selling prices are mostly flat. Manufacturers                 cite higher costs for fuel and petroleum products such as plastics                 and resins. Although paper costs reportedly remain low, contacts                 make frequent mention of possible future increases for corrugated                 cardboard. Insurance costs continue to escalate.
Manufacturers remain intent on controlling employment                 costs and deferring unessential capital spending. Very few firms                 are adding employees, and almost one-half of the respondents are                 shutting facilities or installing labor-saving equipment. Pay                 raises range from zero to 3 percent. Budgets for information technology                 and air conditioning equipment are especially tight.

Although many customer industries are still                 in the doldrums, staffing firms cite pockets of strength—call                 centers, telemarketing, and customer services—as businesses step                 up their marketing efforts. The financial services sector is said                 to be hiring on a moderate scale. Some contacts report stirrings                 in the light industrial sector, particularly in assembly and light                 manufacturing. The technology sector, including software, electronics,                 telecommunications, aerospace, and defense, is lackluster.
The supply of well-qualified workers is ample.                 As a result, many applicants display considerable flexibility                 in terms of wage demands and choice of work. The loose labor market                 has also caused some companies to bypass temporary employment                 agencies and hire directly. Those that do hire through temp firms                 are generally taking longer to hire and are more interested in                 short-term placements; they are not eager to add permanent workers.                 Although wage cuts are rare, wage increases are also minimal.
Temporary employment contacts expect the industry                 to grow during the third quarter, typically the busiest and most                 critical quarter of the year. Nevertheless, 2002 is not expected                 to be a banner year for most contacts.
Most contacts are uncertain about the                 future of the economy and also about their business for the rest                 of 2002. Contacts whose businesses have grown slowly so far expect                 growth to continue to be slow or possibly slow further, while                 those whose businesses are performing well consider the future                 to be somewhat uncertain. As a result, most software and IT respondents                 are holding headcounts level, although a couple are reshaping                 their job mix. Longer-term, many respondents are convinced that                 latent demand exists and will be activated either when the economy                 improves or clients decide they cannot postpone software or IT                 purchases any longer.
