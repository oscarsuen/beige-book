Economic activity was sluggish in late May, according to reports from across the Sixth District.  Merchants' sales did not meet expectations, but inventories were balanced. Auto sales were mixed despite generous incentives.  Some softening was noted in District residential housing markets, but activity remained at healthy levels.  Commercial markets continued to decline throughout the District.  The factory sector was mixed, whereas the tourism and hospitality sector improved.  Financial institutions noted continued strength in consumer lending.  Labor markets were little changed, with few firms hiring on a permanent basis.  Price increases were largely limited to health care, insurance, and some building and packaging products.
Sublease space continued to be a drag on commercial real estate markets throughout the District.  Price concessions were present and construction continued to contract.  Absorption remained weak; however, several reports indicated that some District markets have begun to stabilize.
Pricing pressures were largely benign except for increases in health care costs, insurance, and some building and packaging products.  Concrete prices were up by double-digits since the beginning of the year, and paperboard prices have increased.  Insurance rates continued to escalate.
