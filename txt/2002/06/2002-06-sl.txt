Economic activity in the District               is continuing to pick up, although slowly. Retailers report that               sales have been flat compared with their year-earlier levels, although               many apparel and automobile retailers attribute this to cool, rainy               weather and remain optimistic about the coming months. Cutbacks               continue in some manufacturing industries, although reports of recovery               are increasingly common. The residential real estate market continues               to be strong throughout most of the District, although the market               for high-end homes has been less strong. Commercial real estate               markets continue to be weak throughout the District. Although credit               standards remain largely unchanged, there are reports of increased               credit standards for mortgages and commercial and industrial loans.               In the agricultural sector, flooding and unfavorable weather have               delayed planting and damaged crops in much of the District.
Car dealers in the District report               that sales were up, on average, in April but tapered off in May.               Reasons given for this decline include cool, rainy weather and low               consumer confidence. About one-half of contacts said that strong               manufacturer incentives have had the effect of "stealing" current               sales by prompting customers to buy early. A majority of dealers               are still offering these incentives, although less aggressively.               Several contacts noted decreased interest in new and high-end vehicles               and greater interest in cheaper, fuel-efficient vehicles. Overall,               dealers reported desirable inventory levels for all vehicles. Just               under 70 percent of dealers contacted are optimistic about summer               sales, expecting to see growth over last year, while the rest expect               sales to be around their 2001 levels. About one-third of the dealers               noted higher rejection rates of finance applications, while the               rest reported no change.
Reports from the services sector               are mixed. While distribution and logistics companies are still               recovering from a downturn last fall, some contacts noted that losses               were not as large as expected and that some companies have seen               strong employment and sales. Several medical centers in the District               are expanding, although the shortage of healthcare workers continues               to be a concern. Contacts also reported that advertising and gaming               are strong and that the tourism industry is doing better than expected.
