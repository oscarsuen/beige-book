Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicated that economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in most of the region in April and early May.  With the exception of volatile energy prices, respondents reported little change in prices for most consumer goods and services. Moreover, slack labor market conditions worked to damp increases in wages.  Consumers continued to spend at a steady pace, stimulated in part by discounting in the retail trade and service sectors.  Conditions in District manufacturing generally improved further in the most recent survey period; contacts indicated improved conditions in high-tech manufacturing.  However, most firms remained cautious about making technology investments.  District agricultural producers noted some improvement in conditions in recent weeks.  Commercial real estate markets continued to weaken, while demand for residential real estate remained fairly solid.  Bank contacts reported acceptable levels of asset quality and some evidence of increased strength in loan demand.
Most contacts noted little evidence in the current survey period of changes in the pace of investment spending, especially in high-tech products.  Respondents stated that firms generally planned to remain cautious about investment and expansion plans in the months ahead until a sustained upturn in earnings is evident.
In contrast, demand for residential real estate in the District remained solid in most areas during the survey period.  Contacts observed that residential construction activity in several areas continued to rise at a moderate pace.  Respondents in several District states also noted that home prices continued to appreciate in the most recent survey period; reports indicated that Southern California had the most robust housing markets in the District.
