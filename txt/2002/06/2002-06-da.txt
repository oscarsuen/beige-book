Eleventh District economic activity continued to show signs of slow improvement in late-April and May. However, contacts in several industries were disappointed that growth did not pick up as much as they had hoped. Energy activity was up sharply, and manufacturing activity increased. Demand for business services remained unchanged overall, but there were some mild signs of strengthening. Retail sales continued at roughly the same, lackluster pace as the last Beige Book. Construction and real estate activity was weak. The financial services industry reported little change in deposit or lending activity. Drought continued to plague the District's agricultural industry, but the Farm Bill should help the industry's cash flow.
High-tech manufacturing continues to slowly improve, but respondents note that growth is very uneven. Sales of consumer items such as of DVD players, electronic games, appliances and wireless devices are improving, while business investment in technology equipment remains weak. Inventories are reported to be mostly in good shape. Respondents who produce mostly for the consumer market are optimistic that growth will continue to improve over the next six months but those who serve the business market are very uncertain about the short-term outlook. Contacts in the telecommunications industry report no improvement in demand and believe the recovery will take longer than expected.
Demand for petrochemicals has increased. While inventory restocking has helped drive petrochemical sales, there is growing evidence that a significant part of the demand surge is related to economic growth. Refineries have been operating at high levels of production for most of April and May, but have recently lowered the rate of production slightly because gasoline prices--and refining margins--have weakened.
