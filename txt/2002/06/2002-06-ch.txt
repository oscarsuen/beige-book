Reports from Seventh District contacts suggested modest expansion                 in economic activity in April and May. Consumer spending generally                 remained sluggish, but there were reports of strengthening in                 a few segments. Construction and real estate reports were again                 mixed. Manufacturing activity continued to pick up, although the                 improvements were modest. Overall loan demand was mixed, with                 businesses remaining reluctant to borrow. Labor demand appeared                 to improve further in recent weeks. Generally, wage and price                 pressures remained subdued. Unseasonable weather seriously disrupted                 crop planting in some areas. Increases in District farmland values                 in the first quarter were the strongest in several years, but                 bankers reported that farm credit conditions deteriorated for                 the second consecutive quarter.
