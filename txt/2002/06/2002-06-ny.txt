The District's economy has shown further signs of perking up                 since the last report, despite some softening in consumer spending                 and consumer borrowing. There has been no discernible pickup in                 price pressures. The labor market has shown signs of firming.                 Retail sales were generally below plan in May, partly due to unseasonably                 cool weather, with same-store sales little changed from a year                 earlier; still, inventory levels were reported as satisfactory,                 while selling prices were little changed. Surveys of regional                 manufacturing firms and purchasing managers suggest a slight deceleration                 in growth in May, but a                pickup in cost pressures. Housing markets have strengthened further,                especially in the New York City area. Office markets have stabilized,                 though rents are still down by well over 10 percent from a year                 ago. Finally, bankers report weaker demand for consumer loans,                 but stronger demand from commercial borrowers, along with declining                 delinquency rates for consumer and home mortgage loans and tighter                 lending standards.
Regarding the multi-family sector, a leading New York City appraisal                 firm and a major real estate firm both report further strengthening                 in Manhattan's co-op and condo market in April and May. A number                 of recent transactions have had multiple bids, though only modestly                 above the asking price, and prices are reported to be roughly                 back on par with a year ago and increasing. These contacts also                 report that Manhattan's rental market, though still somewhat slack,                 has shown clear signs of picking up since the last report. In                 contrast, eastern Long Island's summer rental market is said to                 be much weaker than                last year.
Commercial real estate markets in the New York City area have                 shown more signs of stabilizing since the last report. In Manhattan,                 Midtown's vacancy rate edged up from 7.8 to 8.1 percent in April,                 but Downtown's rate held steady at 11.9 percent. Asking rents                 are reported to be down 10-15 percent from a year ago, and this                 is said to understate the decline in actual rents. Office rental                                markets in New York City's suburbs have been mixed, with vacancy                 rates                declining in Westchester County, little changed in Long Island,                 but rising in                central and northern New Jersey and Fairfield County, Connecticut.                Separately, office vacancy rates in the suburbs of Albany rose                 to a nearly 10-year high in May, but vacancy rates in downtown                 Albany have declined over the past year.
According to our May survey of New York State manufacturers,                 a smaller proportion of respondents reported improvement in business                 conditions than in April, but positive responses still outnumbered                 negatives. Moreover, expectations on the near-term outlook were                 overwhelmingly positive, even more so than in April. However,                 manufacturers increasingly indicate that input costs have risen,                 but that they have been unable to raise selling prices.                Separately, a growing proportion of New York City area purchasing                 managers report favorable business conditions in May, though those                 in the manufacturing sector report some deceleration from the                 rapid pace seen in April. Meanwhile, Buffalo-area purchasers report                 some weakening in manufacturing-sector conditions and production                 activity, but a modest pickup in hiring. Purchasers in both Buffalo                 and New York City note some pickup in price pressures in May.
On the supply side, bankers report tightening credit standards                 for all types of loans except for residential mortgages, for which                 standards remained stable. Loan rates decreased for most types                 of loans, though rates on nonresidential mortgages held steady.                 Deposit rates also fell since the last report. Lenders report                 lower delinquency rates on consumer loans and residential mortgages,                                but little change in rates for non-residential mortgages and commercial                 and                industrial loans.
