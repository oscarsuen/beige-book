The region's manufacturers forecast further improvement.  Over half of the firms surveyed in May expect increases in orders and shipments during the next six months, while few anticipate decreases.  An increase in demand will prompt some additional hiring and extension of working hours, but the increases will be modest, according to the manufacturers surveyed.  Likewise, capital spending plans at area plants indicate that only slight increases are likely in the months ahead.
Auto dealers said sales in May were steady at a healthy pace, although down marginally from the rate set in May of last year.  Sales of most makes of new cars have been relatively brisk, and sales of used cars have been strong as well.
Retailers expect sales to remain on a slight upward trend, with the usual seasonal slowing during late summer.  Most of those surveyed for this report are optimistic that the fall will bring a boost to the sales rate.  Auto dealers generally expect steady sales for the rest of the year.
Bankers in the Third District expect overall lending to continue to grow slowly this year.  They anticipate very modest growth in business and consumer lending, but they expect a slowdown in residential real estate lending.
Residential real estate agents generally reported a high rate of sales of both new and existing homes in April and May.  Price appreciation has appeared to accelerate for existing homes, and builders have been raising prices for new homes.  Builders and real estate agents expect demand for homes to remain strong as long as mortgage interest rates do not climb, but they expect the pace of sales to slow as fewer existing homes become available for sale and local government limitations on development impede new construction.
