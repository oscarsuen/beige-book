Reports on automobile sales in late April and               May were uneven. Sales were robust in the Boston, Chicago, and San               Francisco Districts. Reports from Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis,               Minneapolis, and Dallas were mixed. Philadelphia and Kansas City               said that sales were down on a year-over-year basis, although Philadelphia               noted that sales were at healthy levels. In the Atlanta and St.               Louis Districts, some dealers complained about lost sales because               potential buyers did not qualify for credit.
Reports on the tourism and hospitality industry               generally continued to indicate an upward trend. Hotel occupancy               picked up slightly in the San Francisco District and remained steady               in the New York District. Richmond and Boston said that hotels reported               steady demand and were hiring additional staff; sources in South               Carolina said that business had "turned the corner" from September               11 effects. Atlanta and San Francisco reported strong forward bookings               for summer tourist destinations, and Florida theme parks were adding               to payrolls. Chicago noted that a major airline was experiencing               strong leisure travel but weak business travel. In the Cleveland               District, business conference attendance remained lower than last               year.
Most Districts continued to report weak commercial               real estate markets, with high vacancy rates and lower rental rates.               Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized               commercial markets as weak. Commercial markets eased in the Philadelphia               District and declined in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and Minneapolis               Districts. New York reported that markets were stabilizing in the               New York City area. Chicago reported mixed results. Richmond noted               an increase in commercial activity, mainly in the office segment.
Price increases remained subdued overall, but               the prices of a few goods and services rose substantially. Most               Districts reported steel prices were sharply higher. Dallas said               that the prospect of further steel price increases had spurred strong               sales for fabricated metal products. Rising insurance costs were               noted as concerns in the Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis,               and San Francisco Districts. Boston, Richmond, and Dallas reported               higher prices for energy and petrochemical products. New York and               Dallas reported that manufacturers generally were not able to pass               along higher input costs.
Energy-related activities were up in the Minneapolis,               Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Kansas City attributed some of               the rebound to anticipated increases in natural gas prices in coming               months. Minneapolis noted expansions in the iron ore mining industry.
