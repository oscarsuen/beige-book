A majority of Federal Reserve districts               report some signs of improvement in economic conditions in January               and early February. The Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta,               Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts note some pickup in activity,               Chicago cites a more positive tone, and Kansas City and St. Louis               say that economic activity is weak, but there are some bright spots.               Cleveland indicates that although some positive signs continue to               emerge, overall business conditions in the district have neither               improved nor deteriorated compared with the end of last year. New               York reports mixed signals, and Dallas notes continued weak activity.
Most districts say that manufacturing               activity is generally weak, but selected industries in some areas               are showing more positive results. Boston, New York, Philadelphia,               Atlanta, Dallas, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco report               modest improvements in retail sales recently compared with the end               of last year. Retail results were more mixed in the other districts.               Districts indicate that residential real estate markets are generally               stronger than commercial markets. Reports on demand for bank loans               are mixed across the districts. Warm, dry weather figures prominently               in agricultural reports. Warm weather and the slow global economy               have contributed to weaker energy demand.
Labor markets continue to be slack               in most districts, with many citing business contacts who have suspended               bonuses, frozen wages, or skipped annual salary increases. However,               contacts at temporary employment firms in several districts suggest               employment is bottoming out, and new hires in selected occupations               are said to be in short supply. While wage and price pressures are               described as "subdued" to "largely nonexistent," business contacts               in many districts mentioned rising health insurance costs. Firms               in most districts indicate that their purchase and selling prices               are generally stable, but Dallas reports upward pressure on services               prices and declining prices for chemicals and paper, while Cleveland               notes an increase in spot market prices for steel.
Wage and price pressures in the retail               sector are virtually nonexistent. Retail employment is said to be               stable in Boston, but down in the Richmond and San Francisco districts.               Most districts indicate that retail contacts expect flat to slightly               increasing sales during the first half of 2002; only retailers in               the St. Louis and Philadelphia districts expect somewhat stronger               sales growth during this period. The Boston, Cleveland, and Kansas               City districts say that retailers expect sales growth to resume               at a modest pace during the second half of 2002.
Cleveland and Chicago report a pickup               in automotive production in response to higher demand; decreases               in other districts were said to be due partly to winter storm conditions.               Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco note stabilization or               slight improvement in demand for high-tech products, which their               contacts attributed largely to lean finished goods inventories in               these sectors. St. Louis and Dallas indicate that petrochemical               and oil refinery production has been sluggish. Reports on most other               industries are mixed, with increased production in some parts of               the country and decreased production in others.
Throughout the nation, manufacturers               are said to be experiencing flat or declining costs for materials               and energy. Selling prices are reported to be mostly flat, but several               districts mention modest increases in steel prices from low levels.
Some districts comment that manufacturers are               no longer cutting back on labor to the same degree they did in 2001.               For example, Cleveland mentions that manufacturing employment has               fallen but that widespread layoffs in steel and aerospace appear               to have subsided. Manufacturers in the Philadelphia and Richmond               districts also are said to be reducing regular employment but holding               steady or increasing the length of the workweek.
Conditions in the temporary labor               market continue to be slack in most reporting districts, but the               worst seems to be over. District reports suggest that widespread               layoffs have subsided and demand for workers appears to be stabilizing.               The Richmond district is the most upbeat, with reports of strengthening               demand for temporary workers in recent weeks. Atlanta notes improvement               in outplacement activity, even though labor market conditions remain               weak. Other districts indicate that ample supplies of labor are               still readily available, although certain areas of employment in               some districts bucked the sluggish trend. The legal industry in               New York exhibited strong demand for temps; employers in the Richmond               district are seeking light industry workers and customer service               representatives; and, in Dallas, demand was strong for administrative               and clerical positions, and in the banking and retail industries               and some professional services.
Residential markets remained steady               or strengthened during the last two months. Home sales and demand               for houses are reported to be strong in the New York, Philadelphia,               Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco               districts. Lower-priced home sales are especially strong, while               demand for the high-end segment of the market has weakened in a               few districts. New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Minneapolis               note increased home sale prices compared with a year earlier. New               home construction was unchanged or increased in Cleveland, St. Louis,               and Minneapolis, but was lower than a year ago in Kansas City.
According to the Atlanta and Dallas               districts, the second warmest U.S. weather on record for November               through January plus global economic weakness have damped demand               for heating oil and natural gas and have kept prices low. Minneapolis               reports that drilling activity has fallen slightly in recent weeks,               while Kansas City notes that the district's count of active oil               and gas drilling rigs remains near the two-year low hit in late               2001. In the Dallas district, energy activity shows signs of bottoming               out and stocks of crude oil, heating oil, and natural gas are all               well above last year's levels. Because firms storing natural gas               will not want to hold it over the summer, many Dallas contacts expect               significant downward pressure on natural gas prices this spring.               In the case of mining, Minneapolis iron ore production is up slightly               from late 2001 levels and is nearing more normal levels. In Kansas               City, higher coal prices have encouraged increased activity.
