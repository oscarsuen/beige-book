Overall economic activity in the Ninth District             appears to have edged up in recent months. Residential construction             and mining activities are up slightly. The commercial construction,             tourism and energy sectors have slowed. Meanwhile, the consumer spending,             manufacturing and agriculture sectors are mixed. From early January             to mid-February, labor markets loosened slightly, while overall wages             and prices were stable. However, decreases in some construction materials             prices and increases in home prices and insurance premiums were noted.
District home building is solid. Home permits               in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area were up 7 percent in January compared               with a year earlier, with strength particularly noted in multi-family               construction. According to residential construction officials in               Sioux Falls, S.D., home builders are expected to be busy in 2002,               but the year is likely to finish somewhat slower than the previous               two record-breaking years. A contractor in Bismarck, N.D., expects               to build 25 percent more housing in 2002 compared with a year earlier.               Bank directors reported that the outlook for residential construction               is optimistic for the upcoming year, with softness noted in the               high-end housing market in Montana.
In contrast, a St. Paul area mall manager noted               slightly less traffic in January and February compared with last               year. A Helena branch bank director reported slow February traffic               at a Montana mall compared with a year ago. A Minnesota-based leather               products retailer said that same-store sales in January were down               17 percent compared with last year. Auto sales in Minnesota slowed               in January and February, according to a representative of an auto               dealers association.
Little snowfall and warm weather has halted winter               tourism activities in many areas. Some businesses in the Upper Peninsula               of Michigan expect the season to be off as much as 40 percent to               50 percent due to poor snowmobiling conditions. A tourism official               in South Dakota estimated ski activity down 45 percent and snowmobiling               down 70 percent this year compared with a year ago. However, traffic               at Mount Rushmore, considered a "fair weather" attraction, set monthly               attendance records from October through January. A ski resort in               Montana reported good snow conditions this year and an increase               in visits over last year.
As a marker of looser labor markets, a Minnesota               company recently reported a 70 percent acceptance rate of offers               made to applicants for open positions, an increase from a historical               average of 50 percent. Initial claims for unemployment insurance               in Minnesota were up 28 percent in January compared with a year               earlier, including a large increase in claims from the construction               sector.
In contrast, a computer company is planning to               hire 100 employees in North Dakota. Furthermore, U.S. Customs will               add 39 jobs at North Dakota's border with Canada. A call center               in northern Minnesota will add 65 more workers.
Wage increases are modest. St. Paul public school               teachers recently agreed to a 2 percent increase in pay; the overall               wage and benefit package was considered average compared with recent               contracts, according to a union official. In contrast, according               to the results of a December St. Cloud Area Quarterly Business Report               survey, 55 percent of respondents in central Minnesota expect increases               in employee compensation by June.
Price increases are moderate, with price decreases               noted in some construction materials and increases in home prices               and insurance rates. Recent steel and cement prices have decreased               slightly from a year earlier. Meanwhile, the median price of homes               recently sold in Minneapolis-St. Paul is up 12 percent compared               with a year earlier. Some home insurance premiums during the past               two months are 10 percent to 30 percent higher than last year in               North Dakota, according to an official.
