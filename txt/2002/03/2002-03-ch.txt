Reports of Seventh District economic activity             through mid-to-late February were mixed, but the overall tone was             more positive than earlier in the year. Consumer spending remained             mostly soft in the region, though there were some signs of strength             in a few sectors. Real estate and construction activities were again             mixed, with continuing vigor on the residential side and softness             on the business side. Manufacturing activity was generally weak, but             there were more frequent reports of increasing production and new             orders. Lending activity appeared to increase modestly, with firming             loan demand from businesses. Labor markets slackened modestly, with             most contacts saying that the worst of the region's job losses had             passed. There were no new indications of intensifying pressure on             wages or prices at the retail level.
Reports on consumer spending through mid-February were mixed, but               generally indicated relatively weak spending. Several contacts reported               that sales results in the Midwest were softer than in other regions.               One discount retailer noted that sales of staples and discounted               items remained strong, but sales of discretionary merchandise were               softer. Entertainment spending was mixed. With favorable weather               said to be helping consumers get out and about, theater revenues               were reported to be up between 5 percent and 10 percent so far in               2002. But sales results at casual dining restaurants remained generally               soft, with one industry contact saying that conditions were "hard               to read." Regional auto sales also were said to be mixed, but generally               weaker than late last year. Reports on tourism and travel varied.               A contact with one airline reported strong load factors, and said               the company was planning to add 7 percent or 8 percent to its flight               capacity, mainly through increased domestic flights. At the same               time, United Airlines announced publicly that on April 1 it would               be calling back 1,200 of its recently furloughed flight attendants,               over one-third of whom are based in Chicago. Other contacts, however,               suggested that tourism and travel in the region was softer than               they had expected. Signs of intensifying pressure on retail prices               were virtually nonexistent, as most contacts said that customers               remained very value conscious.
Labor markets continued to slacken in the Seventh District, but               most contacts indicated that the demand for labor was stabilizing.               One industry analyst said that the number of mass layoffs had slowed,               but idled workers were finding it more difficult to secure work.               A contact with a large staffing agency said that total billable               hours and revenues rose early in 2002, after sinking throughout               2001. This contact also noted that most of the company's regional               managers, who at this time last year "saw no end in sight" to the               industry's doldrums, expressed confidence in a rebound in the second               half of this year. Contacts in some industries have said that the               general economic slowdown has helped improve worker productivity               as turnover rates have decreased and managers were learning to "manage               better" during lean economic times. There were no new reports of               intensifying pressure on wages, but contacts continued to express               concern over rising health insurance costs.
