The Tenth District economy remained very sluggish             in late January and February, but some small signs of improvement             were reported. Manufacturing activity fell further, automobile sales             and residential construction activity declined, and commercial real             estate activity remained weak. On the positive side, however, retail             sales excluding autos edged higher, home sales strengthened, and energy             activity stabilized. In the farm economy, dry weather continued to             hinder the development of the winter wheat crop. District labor markets             remained considerably less tight than a year ago, and wage pressures             were largely nonexistent. Retail prices and prices for construction             materials were flat, while prices for several manufacturing materials             edged lower.
