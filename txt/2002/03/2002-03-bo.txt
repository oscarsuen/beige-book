Business conditions are improving in the First             District. Manufacturers and retailers report more positive results             in mid-February than they did at the beginning of the year, and software             contacts say business is picking up. The commercial real estate market             is said to be on the bottom, no longer moving down, and staffing firms             are seeing some improvement, but business is still very slow. Most             contacts expect activity levels to improve very modestly later this             year.
Employment is reported to be stable at most retail               firms; head counts are generally level with year-earlier. One company               with "major, major" layoffs in the last year is not currently planning               further cuts. Wage trends are mixed, with one firm planning "the               usual" 3 percent pay hike this summer, another seeing costs jump               because of a rise in the minimum wage, and a third instituting a               wage freeze.
Retailers say vendor prices are fairly stable.               In most cases, their selling prices are also steady, although one               firm is raising prices on selected products. The computer retailer               reports that the pace of price declines increased in the last half               of last year but has attenuated in the last three months.
Contacted retailers are expecting the economy               and their businesses to improve in 2002. One respondent says he               foresees "something between dead flat and the beginning of a very               modest recovery." Most see the improvement concentrated in the second               half and none expects a strong upturn.
Contacts report that selling prices and materials               costs are generally flat. In a variety of industries, respondents               indicate that they are not even considering higher price quotes               because they would not stick. Contacts continue to express concern               about steep increases in insurance rates.
Manufacturers remain intent on controlling costs.               They are avoiding higher input costs by pressuring their vendors               or shifting to lower-cost sources. Most contacts reduced employment               in 2001, and most anticipate that their headcounts will be steady               or drifting downward in the remainder of 2002. Pay raises will be               nonexistent at some firms and limited to 2 to 3 percent at others.               Most contacts reduced inventories last year and are contemplating               no buildup from current levels. In describing capital spending plans,               manufacturers expressed a "do with what we have" mentality, especially               with respect to technology investments. Many say they will focus               on maintaining their existing capital and investing to develop new               products.
Revenue expectations for 2002 generally are muted.               Although the consensus continues to be that business will improve,               manufacturers remain doubtful that they will see any substantial               pickup until sometime in the second half of the year.
