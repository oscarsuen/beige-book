Many industries continue to report rising costs               for all types of insurance. Security costs are also rising, particularly               for the airline industry. Contacts in several industries note that               stiff competition has prevented these cost increases from being               passed along to consumers. While labor markets have loosened, many               firms say competition remains stiff for quality workers and wages               are increasing for those employees.
The high-tech industry reported that sales continued               to bounce around the bottom of the cycle. While most respondents               believe a recovery has begun, it is expected to be very slow. Demand               for telecommunications products was still very weak, particularly               in Europe, and sales of personal computers continued to be "anemic."               Inventories are lean across high-tech industries, according to contacts.
Demand for petrochemicals and refined products               remained weak. Some refineries have announced cuts in production               while others have begun early turnarounds to produce gasoline for               the spring and summer.
Residential activity is still weak, and potential               homebuyers continue to back out of deals, according to contacts.               Existing home inventories have risen as people continue to leave               houses they can not afford. Demand for multifamily housing is also               weak and concessions are prevalent. Demand remains solid, however,               for lower priced homes.
