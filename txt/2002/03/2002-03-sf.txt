Respondents in the services sector noted that               the demand for professional services such as financial counseling,               advertising, and public relations fell in recent weeks. In contrast,               demand for communications services reportedly improved in January               and February. Travel and tourism also picked up slightly, although               demand remained well below year-earlier levels, creating excess               capacity at hotels, rental car agencies, airlines, and cruise ships.
Outside the high-tech sector, respondents reported               little improvement, with falling orders and excess capacity continuing               to depress output and earnings. Weakness was especially apparent               in the District's aerospace sector, where the impact of reduced               demand for air travel is beginning to show through to employment               at aircraft and parts manufacturers. Numerous manufacturing contacts               reported that the strong dollar and weak foreign economies continued               to damp export demand for manufactured goods.
In contrast, residential real estate markets in               the District remained solid. Respondents noted that sales of low-to-median               priced homes were strong, with many listed properties receiving               multiple offers. In California, markets in the San Francisco Bay               Area improved in January and February adding to ongoing strength               in Southern California and the Central Valley. Across the District,               the market for high-end homes remained weak, with sales and prices               declining relative to the previous survey period.
