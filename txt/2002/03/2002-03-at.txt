Sixth District contacts reported improved               conditions in many sectors during January and early February, and               most noted cautious optimism regarding the near-term outlook. The               majority of retail contacts described sales as exceeding their expectations.               Automobile sales did fall from the robust pace of past months, but               inventory levels were mostly described as acceptable. Reports indicated               positive signs from the manufacturing sector as orders and inventories               were stabilizing. The defense industry, in particular, received               a significant boost in new orders. Residential real estate markets               maintained their strength, but contacts noted that weakness persisted               in the District's office and industrial markets. The improving trend               in the tourism and hospitality industry also continued, although               hotel occupancies remained below those of a year ago. Bank lending               activity was still sluggish, and remained supported primarily by               robust mortgage refinancing. Price pressures were subdued overall.               Several contacts noted rising health care, insurance, and security               costs.
District commercial real estate markets remained               weak in January and early February. Office and industrial vacancy               rates continued to run at high levels and prices were under downward               pressure. The majority of new construction work is government-related               or small build-to-suit projects.
Prices were described as stable by most accounts.               However, continuing increases in health care costs, security costs,               and insurance was noted, and price discounting for rental cars and               cruises were ending. Reports from the Gulf coast noted that high               natural gas inventories and continued warm weather were keeping               natural gas prices in check.
