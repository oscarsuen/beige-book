Despite some bright spots, economic activity             in the District continues to be weak. Retail sales in December and             January were generally at or just below their level from a year earlier,             although retailers are mildly optimistic about the upcoming months.             The manufacturing sector has been mixed, with some industries continuing             to face reduced orders while others have begun to recover. The residential             real estate sector has picked up and remains relatively strong throughout             most of the District. New housing permits continue to be issued at             a higher level than a year earlier. Commercial real estate markets             have continued to be stagnant throughout the District, with rising             delinquencies in at least one area. Driven by rising real estate loans             and loans to banks outside of the District, total loans outstanding             at small- and medium-sized banks have risen significantly. Agricultural             producers in the District anticipate reduced planted acreage for wheat             and cotton in the upcoming year, although there is a great deal of             uncertainty as farmers await the passage of the new farm bill.
Car dealers in the District report that sales               in December were higher, on average, but have tapered off since               the end of the year. Almost all contacts attribute this pattern               to financing incentives and rebates offered by manufacturers on               new cars, the most aggressive of which have ended recently. Several               dealers reported that, because of ongoing rebate offers, new cars               continue to sell better than used cars, causing new-car inventories               to be okay-to-low and used-car inventories to be okay-to-high. About               one-half of the contacts noted higher rejection rates for finance               applications, while the other half have seen no change. Although               individual responses about car sales in the next few months varied               from very optimistic to very pessimistic, the average dealer was               neither optimistic nor pessimistic.
Residential construction opportunities continue               to grow, as December year-to-date permit levels were higher than               year-earlier levels in most of the District's metropolitan areas.               Government-sponsored construction opportunities remain strong in               the Kentucky and Indiana portions of the District with the approval               of projects for highway and bridge construction as well as projects               for public facilities such as libraries and jails. Commercial contractors               in Arkansas and western Tennessee report commercial building has               been slow over the past few months, but they remain optimistic for               2002.
Contacts in central and northeastern Arkansas,               and western Tennessee have reported strong loan demand, particularly               for residential lending. Bankers in northeast Mississippi and western               Tennessee reported high past-due loan ratios and high bankruptcy               filings. Nonetheless, they consider themselves in a good position               with high liquidity and loan loss reserves.
