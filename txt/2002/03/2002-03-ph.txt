The consensus among Third District businesses               surveyed in February is that there will be slow growth in the region               during the rest of the year. Manufacturers expect gains in shipments               and orders. Retailers anticipate modest improvement in sales. Auto               dealers expect the current sales rate to carry through most of the               year. Bank credit officers generally forecast slow growth in overall               lending, with gains in commercial and industrial loans as well as               consumer credit but a falloff in real estate lending. Contacts in               the commercial real estate industry forecast steady market conditions               for the first half of the year and some increase in demand for space               in the second half of the year. Residential real estate contacts               expect sales of both new and existing homes to be steady through               most of the year at around the current rate.
Local manufacturers have positive forecasts. Over               half of the firms surveyed in February forecast increases in orders               and shipments during the next six months, while around one in 10               anticipate decreases. On balance, area firms have raised capital               spending plans, but increases are modest and spotty across the major               industrial sectors in the region. Several chemical and plastics               companies have scheduled increases in outlays for the first half               of the year. Capital spending in other manufacturing sectors is               likely to be flat or up just slightly.
Most area retailers said their inventories were               at appropriate levels. Stores in the region have increased discounting               to spur sales of winter merchandise during a prolonged spell of               warm weather, but they have been conservative in their buying of               spring merchandise and do not expect to make significant markdowns               on spring goods. Store executives believe consumer confidence may               be firming, and some have raised their sales forecasts for the year.               On average, they expect sales for the year to be around 5 percent               above last year, on a comparable stores basis.
Auto sales in the region were steady in February.               Although below last year's high rate, the current pace of sales               was described as good by most of the dealers contacted for this               report, as manufacturers' incentives continued to attract car buyers.               Inventories were generally described as in line with sales. Dealers               expect sales to continue around the current rate through most of               the year.
Bankers in the Third District expect overall loan               demand to increase slowly through the year. They expect a modest               economic recovery with commensurate growth in business and consumer               lending, but they anticipate that residential real estate lending,               both refinancing and purchase mortgage activity, will be slower               this year compared with last year.
Residential real estate agents generally reported               steady sales of both new and existing homes. Sales have been running               at a fairly high rate in most price categories except for the very               high end, where sales have slipped. Price appreciation has been               steady, except for very expensive homes. Price appreciation for               these homes has slowed in recent months. Home builders also reported               steady sales, although below last year's rate. Builders' backlogs               remain high. Real estate agents and builders indicated that relatively               low mortgage interest rates continue to support home sales, and               some real estate agents believe there has also been a shift in consumer               attitudes favoring home purchases over financial investments. Real               estate agents and home builders anticipate relatively steady sales               at around the current pace during the rest of the year.
