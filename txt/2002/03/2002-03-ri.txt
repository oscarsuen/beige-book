Commercial Realtors across the District reported               little change in leasing and construction activity since our last               report. Leasing activity rose slightly in the industrial sector,               but was flat in the office and retail sectors. Vacancy rates continued               to edge up across all sectors and a number of District contacts               noted the persistence of a "wait and see" attitude among clients.               Rents stabilized in the retail and industrial sectors, but declined               further in the office sector. The rate of new sublease space coming               onto the market declined across the office and retail markets. A               Northern Virginia Realtor reported that the office-sublet market               was finally starting to "firm up" and that vacant space was being               absorbed by "a variety of users." Although a smattering of new projects               were reported, new construction activity remained generally flat               across the District.
