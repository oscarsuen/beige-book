More generally, retailers report that inventory levels remain satisfactory.  One large chain indicates that it is building inventories of imports for the upcoming fall and winter seasons earlier than usual, in anticipation of a longshoreman's strike on the West Coast this summer. Most contacts report that selling prices and merchandise costs are essentially flat. Retail wage costs remain fairly stable, but contacts continue to report sharp increases in health and property insurance premiums. One major chain notes that costs in both these categories are running 20 percent ahead of a year ago.
Recent surveys of District residents suggest sturdy improvement in consumer confidence. According to the Conference Board, consumer confidence in the Middle Atlantic region rose sharply in March, climbing to its highest level since last August. A Siena College survey of New York State residents shows that confidence improved across the state in the first quarter, led by New York City.
In contrast, the market for rental apartments remains weak; in both Manhattan and along the Hudson waterfront in New Jersey, rents are reportedly averaging 15 percent lower than a year ago, and some landlords are offering a month's free rent.  Contacts attribute the dichotomy between the sales and rental markets to low mortgage rates, as well as the fact that local residential development in recent years has almost entirely consisted of rental properties.
Commercial real estate markets, though still slack, showed signs of stabilizing in February and March.  A major Manhattan brokerage firm reports that office availability rates, which had climbed to a roughly three-year high in January, leveled off in February and March.  Although leasing activity was subdued in the first quarter, much less new space came to market than in the fourth quarter of 2001.
Manhattan hotels report that business continued to recover in March, with the occupancy rate roughly on par with a year earlier.  Room rates were down roughly 12 percent from a year earlier--about the same as in February but substantially improved from January and especially late-2001.
New York State's goods-producing sector has shown further signs of rebounding. New York City area purchasing managers report that manufacturing-sector conditions continued to strengthen in March, and they expressed more widespread optimism about the near-term outlook than in nearly two years.  Purchasers at Buffalo-area factories report that production activity, new orders and employment leveled off in March, after declining in the first two months of the year.  Purchasers in both areas report that input prices were little changed.  More recently, based on a survey conducted in early April, New York State manufacturers report that business conditions resumed an improving trend, following a lull in March, and that price pressures increased modestly.  Respondents also express increasingly widespread optimism about the near-term business outlook.
