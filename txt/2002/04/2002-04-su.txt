Almost all Federal               Reserve Districts reported signs of improvement or actual increases               in economic activity since the last survey. The sole exception was               Boston, which described economic activity as mixed. While the overall               tone was positive, a few districts expressed qualifications about               the pace of the recovery or the strength of their regional economies.               Cleveland said its economy continued to improve but cited concerns               that the rate of improvement had slowed considerably from earlier               in the year. Also, Kansas City and Dallas noted that their economies               were still weak despite recent signs of improvement.
Retail sales increased or held steady in most               districts, and all districts reported stable or improved manufacturing               conditions. Manufacturers' capital spending plans, however, remained               limited. Residential real estate activity was strong in most districts,               as both home sales and construction increased. Tourism activity               also improved in most areas, while other services activity held               steady. Demand for bank loans was little changed in most districts,               although increases were reported in some regions. Commercial real               estate markets remained generally weak, especially in the San Francisco,               Dallas, and Atlanta districts, but showed signs of steadying in               the New York, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City districts. Energy               activity continued to ease, and agricultural crops in several districts               were damaged by adverse spring weather.
Despite the increases in economic activity reported               in many districts, labor markets remained slack and wage and price               pressures generally stayed in check. Demand for labor showed signs               of firming in several districts but was still reported as weak in               others. Except for skilled health care workers, there were very               few reports of labor shortages. Also, those districts that mentioned               wage pressures described them as minimal. Retail prices were generally               flat. Steel producers sharply boosted prices, but most other manufacturers               held prices steady despite reports in some districts of higher costs               for fuel, steel, and petroleum-based inputs.
Automobile sales were characterized as mixed or               flat in most districts reporting on such activity. Dealers were               cautiously optimistic about future sales in the Philadelphia and               Kansas City districts. On the other hand, Cleveland district auto               dealers did not expect to meet last year's sales levels, and dealers               in the Dallas district were concerned that rising interest rates               would dampen sales. Dealers in the St. Louis district were also               keeping inventories a little lower than usual in case sales did               not pick up.
Manufacturers were generally optimistic about               the outlook for factory activity later in the year. Purchasing managers               in the New York district, in fact, reported their highest expectations               for increases since mid-2000. In contrast, some producers of capital               goods in the Boston district expected weakness to continue until               2003. Despite the generally positive outlook, capital spending plans               remained rather limited across the country. Kansas City reported               a similar number of firms expected to increase as to decrease capital               expenditures over the next six months. Philadelphia reported that               manufacturers have raised capital spending plans, on balance, but               that the planned increases have been spotty and concentrated mainly               in the chemicals and plastics industries.
Commercial real estate activity remained generally               weak but appeared to be stabilizing in a few districts. Markets               remained especially weak in the San Francisco, Dallas, and Atlanta               districts. In the San Francisco district, vacancy rates continued               to increase, lease rates continued to decline, and new construction               was at a minimum. In the Dallas district, office markets were still               being held back by overcapacity and weak demand, causing steep declines               in rental rates in many areas. Commercial markets in Atlanta also               continued to suffer from weak demand, limiting new construction.               Commercial builders in the Cleveland district expected to be busy               in the coming months but were somewhat less optimistic than in the               previous survey, with more projects still in the planning stage               than they had hoped. On the positive side, commercial markets in               a few districts showed some signs of stabilization or improvement.               Leasing activity strengthened in the Richmond district, and office               vacancy rates appeared to level off in the New York, Chicago, and               Kansas City districts following months of steady increases. There               were also scattered reports in the Chicago district of sublease               space being pulled off the market by tenants who had overestimated               the extent of the business slowdown.
Activity in other service industries was generally               steady. Trucking service firms in the Cleveland district noted a               moderate increase in the volume of manufacturing shipments, while               Dallas indicated that demand for transportation services was still               low relative to past levels. In the Cleveland district, trucking               firms' operating margins remained very thin due to high fuel and               insurance costs. A media company in the Richmond district reported               that ad revenues rose for the first time in over a year, and insurance               firms in Boston reported continued high demand for life insurance.               Demand for legal services, particularly in the areas of litigation               and bankruptcy, increased somewhat in the Dallas district.
Changes in credit quality showed no clear pattern.               At banks in the New York district, delinquencies fell for consumer               loans and residential mortgages. At banks in the Atlanta district,               consumer delinquencies increased but remained manageable. Banks               in the Chicago district reported that business loan quality had               stabilized following previous deterioration but was still fragile.               Banks in the Philadelphia and Kansas City districts were still limiting               their commercial real estate lending, and banks in the New York               district continued to tighten standards for all types of loans except               residential mortgages. Otherwise, lending standards were unchanged               in those districts reporting on them.
In the farm economy, spring weather conditions               have adversely affected some areas. Continued low levels of soil               moisture in most of the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas districts               have damaged crops, while portions of the Cleveland, Chicago, and               St. Louis districts reported excessively wet conditions. Recent               cold weather may have also damaged the apple, peach, and strawberry               crops in the Richmond district. The winter wheat crop was reported               to be doing well in areas with sufficient moisture, including the               Cleveland and St. Louis districts, but has been severely damaged               in the drought areas of the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts.               Spring planting is either under way or is expected to begin soon               in most districts, with St. Louis and Chicago reporting that more               acres are being devoted to corn and fewer to soybeans this year.
Wage pressures, when mentioned, were characterized               as minimal. Half of the manufacturers contacted in the Boston district               expected to hold wages steady at least until the second half of               the year. San Francisco reported that wages were being held back               due to significant increases in health care and other insurance               premiums. New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas also reported               substantial increases in insurance costs.
Price pressures for consumer goods were               generally subdued, and prices for most manufactured goods held steady               despite higher costs for steel, fuel, and insurance. Retail prices               were essentially flat in the New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco               districts and were flat to down slightly in the Boston district.               Retail price pressures in the Chicago district also remained subdued,               with price-conscious consumers discouraging retailers from going               ahead with planned increases. Steel producers in the Cleveland and               Chicago districts raised prices significantly. Despite reports of               increasing input costs in some districts, other manufacturers generally               held their selling prices constant. Concerns about rising input               costs were especially pronounced in the Dallas district, where rising               costs for fuel, petroleum-based products, and insurance were said               to be adversely affecting many industries.
