Economic               activity in the District has picked up considerably. In particular,               many firms in the manufacturing sector have experienced increased               sales and orders and, as a result, are expanding production and               employment. Retail and auto sales have remained steady, while residential               real estate sales have been strong throughout the District. Although               commercial real estate markets continue to be weak, commercial construction               has been strong. Total loans outstanding at small- and medium-sized               banks have risen, as have deposits. Unfavorable weather has hampered               spring planting in the southern part of the District, although the               mild winter has led to a good-to-excellent winter wheat crop in               most areas.
Retail sales held steady in the Eighth District.                 A few contacts report that sales have been higher at discount                 stores than at department stores and malls, although mall traffic                 is noted to be relatively normal for this time of year. Auto sales                 have been mixed, with reported sales levels ranging between good                 and flat. Additionally, while some dealers report increased sales                 of used vehicles, others report that it has been new vehicles                 that have been selling well. Several dealers report that their                 inventories of new vehicles are a little lower than usual as they                 take a "wait and see" approach to ordering.
Reports from each of the District's metropolitan areas indicate                 that residential real estate sales have been strong since the                 beginning of the year. Sales volumes in Memphis and Little Rock                 were higher in January and February than a year earlier. Realtors                 in several northern Mississippi markets report improved sales                 are correcting the oversupply of homes in those markets. Sales                 of new homes in Louisville are higher than normal for this time                 of the year. Nonetheless, slow sales in homes valued over $250,000                 reflects caution among District homebuyers. The Memphis market                 for industrial space recorded lower absorption for 2001 than for                 2000, leading to lower lease rates in 2002. The lease rate for                 commercial space in Little Rock remains steady. Net absorption                 and construction of office space in St. Louis continued to decline                 in the first quarter.
Residential and commercial construction has                 been strong in the District, despite the slump in the markets                 for office space. In all District metropolitan areas the number                 of building permits issued in February was higher than that for                 February 2001. Commercial construction in Arkansas has picked                 up, with large projects concentrated in central and northwest                 Arkansas. Public construction projects and work on dams have kept                 commercial construction steady in western Kentucky. Commercial                 contractors in Memphis expect a delay in new projects until they                 see lower vacancy rates for industrial space.
Farmers in the northern portion of the                 District expect to plant slightly more corn acreage this year,                 which will be offset by slightly reduced soybean plantings. Mississippi                 farmers, however, intend to increase soybean acreage. Contacts                 report that the unresolved federal farm bill has led to uncertainty                 about loan rates for soybeans. This may contribute to a decline                 in planting intentions and affect producers' ability to obtain                 financing. Cotton farmers in the southern portion of the District                 expect to plant about 11 percent fewer acres this spring, substituting                 corn and rice for cotton on some acreage. This follows the significant                 drop in cotton and cottonseed meal prices. Partly as a result                 of a Russian ban on U.S. poultry imports, the quantity of poultry                 on the market increased over the last month and poultry prices                 have declined modestly. Meanwhile, cattle prices have also declined                 modestly, while hog prices have declined substantially.
