Economic activity in the Seventh District appeared to improve in March and early April, although reports from our contacts remained mixed.  Comments on consumer spending varied, but were generally more positive than in our last summary.  Residential real estate and construction markets eased somewhat, but nonresidential markets appeared to stabilize.  There were further signs of improvement in the District's manufacturing industries, but with only modest increases in new orders and production.  Overall lending activity slowed as demand for household loans softened.  Labor markets remained relatively slack, but there were more frequent reports of hiring.  Retail price pressures were again generally subdued, but there were isolated reports of price increases at the producer level.  Spring planting began in the south and central portions of the District, but wet/cold soils slowed progress.  It is still early in the season, however, and weather forecasts portend a normal pace for spring planting.
