Eleventh District economic activity remained weak in late-February and March but showed signs of improving in the first half of April. Contacts remain cautious about the outlook. Manufacturing activity and retail sales continued to be weak but also showed signs of picking up. Construction and real estate conditions remain weak, and energy production activity continues to decline despite higher oil and natural gas prices. There was little change in financial conditions. Agricultural conditions are dry, and selling prices for major crops are below the cost of production.
Soaring prices for all types of insurance remains a concern for all industries. One contact suggested that the significant increases in worker's compensation and employee health insurance premiums was discouraging business owners from expanding their payroll.

Paper producers said demand has picked up some in the Dallas area, but sales remain below the levels of a year ago. Demand for apparel products also increased, which contacts believe is mostly due to retailers increasing their inventory levels.

Several apparel plants in Texas have already shut down, two are slated to close in August and there was a recent announcement of another facility closing in October.
Demand for petrochemicals has increased but profit margins remain thin. Customers reduced their inventory when prices were falling, but rising costs have pushed up selling prices and extensive inventory restocking throughout the supply chain is boosting orders.
