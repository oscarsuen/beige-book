Demand in the travel and tourism sector continued to pick up across the District, boosting growth in states that are travel dependent, such as Nevada and Hawaii.  Moreover, there continued to be heavy discounting in travel and tourism industries.  Despite the recent pickup, hotel occupancy, air travel, and car rentals reportedly remain below last year's values.
While a number of respondents noted that the recently enacted economic stimulus package soon could bolster fixed investments, most expect the impact to be minimal until demand and companies' cash flow positions improve.  District contacts continued to express concern that the strong dollar is damping export demand for manufactured goods.
In contrast, demand for residential real estate in the District remained solid.  Respondents reported that in the most recent survey period, home prices rose in some District states while remaining unchanged in others.  Contacts noted that construction of entry-level and median-priced homes is on the rise, while construction of higher-end homes is flat.
