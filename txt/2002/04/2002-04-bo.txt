Economic activity in the First District is mixed.  Real estate contacts report residential markets are strong.  Respondents in the insurance industry say demand is picking up.  With exceptions, retail contacts report flat sales compared with a year ago, which they indicate is approximately in line with expectations.  Revenues are flat or down for New England manufacturing contacts, but demand is showing signs of picking up for defense contractors and companies producing selected consumer products.  Both manufacturers and retailers say selling prices are flat.  Many manufacturers are keeping wage freezes in effect; retailers indicate wages are rising only slowly.  Contacts continue to expect only modest recovery and have varied views about when their business will rebound, with some expecting improvement during the second half of this year and others looking into 2003.
Retail contacts are generally holding headcounts steady.  Wages are rising at about a 3 percent pace, which is said to be slower than last year.  One respondent has implemented a wage freeze; another is cutting pay.  Prices are holding steady or falling slightly, with the exception of building supplies affected by tariffs.  Some retailers indicate margins are being squeezed, others say cost cutting has maintained profits.
While retailers say they are hopeful the economy will improve this year, they are not planning on a strong turnaround.  Tourism contacts say leisure travel will recover before conference and business travel.  A few contacts expect the third or fourth quarter of the year to be "significantly better."   Others foresee no real improvement until early 2003.
Manufacturers mostly report that selling prices are flat.  Contacts producing large capital goods, plastics products, and paper are experiencing downward pressures.  Materials costs are largely flat, but manufacturers express concern about announced postal rate hikes, already-rising medical costs, and anticipated increases for metals and petroleum-based products as contracts come up for renewal.
Manufacturers remain intent on controlling costs.  About one-half envision having some form of pay freeze in effect through at least the first half of this year; only a couple have announced the lifting of a pay freeze.  Almost all contacts expect their employment levels to hold steady or to drift downward with internal productivity enhancements or outsourcing.  Manufacturers are retaining a tight stance with respect to capital spending and inventory investment.  Although some contacts indicate that they have "loosened the purse strings" slightly this year, all respondents point to ongoing needs to become more efficient or restore profitability.
Manufacturers express mixed views regarding the outlook.  Some interpret very recent upticks in their business as a confirmation of economic recovery.  Others--notably makers of capital goods--now expect their business to remain weak throughout 2002 rather than improving in the second half.
Although there is a feeling of optimism among insurance respondents, all seem to have concerns about the near future.  One points out that while news reports say the economy is improving, they have not seen any signs yet.  Employment levels are expected to remain the same, with some contacts reporting making a small number of cuts while others report a few additions.
