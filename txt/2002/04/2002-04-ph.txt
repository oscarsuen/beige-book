Business activity in the Third District was on the rise in April.  Manufacturers reported increases in shipments and orders, and slightly more firms were posting gains in new orders in April than in March.  Retail sales of general merchandise have been rising modestly, and stores' year-over-year increases appeared to be accelerating somewhat.  Auto sales have been steady.  Bank loan volumes have been moving up slowly, mainly because of some growth in business lending.  Employment in the region has been on the decline, but the downward trend appears to be moderating.  Employment continued to fall in manufacturing and trade and has been virtually flat among financial and insurance companies.  Employment has begun to rebound in the lodging industry, and there have been some gains in employment in business services except among computer service firms, which have been reducing employment.
Looking ahead, Third District businesses contacted in April expect modest growth in the region during the rest of the year.  Manufacturers forecast increases in shipments and orders. Retailers expect the growth rate of sales to accelerate as the spring selling season gets under way.  Auto dealers anticipate steady sales at around the current rate.  Bankers generally forecast slow growth in overall lending, with relatively stronger increases in commercial and industrial loans and slight gains in consumer lending but a decline in real estate lending.  Companies in all industries intend to add equipment and expand facilities as their business improves, but most of the area firms reporting on their investment plans indicated they would not be making major software purchases this year.  Business firms in the region indicate that, on balance, their capital spending this year will be even with or slightly above last year's levels.
The region's manufacturers have positive forecasts.  Over half of the firms surveyed in April expect increases in orders and shipments during the next six months, while around one in 10 anticipate decreases.  On balance, area manufacturing firms have raised capital spending plans, but increases are modest and spotty across the major industrial sectors in the region.  Several chemical and plastics companies have scheduled increases in outlays.  Capital spending in other manufacturing sectors is likely to be flat or up just slightly.
Auto dealers said sales have been steady recently at a healthy pace.  They expect the current sales rate to continue through the rest of the year, supported by ongoing manufacturers' incentives.
Bankers in the Third District expect overall lending to continue to grow slowly this year.  Several noted that their business customers are seeing increased demand, which should result in some increased financing needs, but bankers do not anticipate a large overall extension of credit to business borrowers for major expansion of facilities.  Bankers expect consumer lending to increase slowly, but they anticipate a slowdown in residential real estate lending.
Although area firms are not planning large increases in capital spending in total, the capital spending that they will make includes a broad range of business equipment as well as new buildings.  Manufacturing companies indicated they would be expanding capacity by adding production equipment.  Service companies said they would be updating office equipment.  Several large retail companies said they would be building new stores, but they were only planning the same number of new stores this year as last.  Firms in most industries indicated that they were unlikely to make large purchases of computer software this year.
