Sixth District contacts reported that conditions in most sectors continued to improve during March, and contacts were generally optimistic about future prospects.  First quarter retail sales rose modestly from a year earlier, but District auto sales were below national trends.  Residential housing markets were robust, whereas commercial real estate markets continued to suffer from weak demand.  Reports from the manufacturing sector indicated that factory activity in the District was improving.  Reports on tourism were also encouraging, and industry contacts suggested a favorable short-term outlook for that sector.  District employment has not risen significantly, but firms were reportedly hiring more temporary staff, and extending work hours in the manufacturing sector.  Significant price increases were reported in health care, insurance and fuel.
