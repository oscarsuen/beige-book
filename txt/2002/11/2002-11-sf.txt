Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicated sluggish economic activity in October and early November, with the pace of growth down from the previous survey period.   Respondents reported little pressure on prices for most consumer goods and services.  Wage increases also were limited, although increased health benefit expenditures boosted employee compensation costs.  Consumer spending softened in recent weeks, especially for big-ticket items such as automobiles, furniture, and consumer electronics.  Demand for manufactured goods other than semiconductors remained weak, with contacts noting deterioration in orders.  District agricultural producers reported little change in conditions, with balanced supply and demand keeping prices above costs.  District housing demand remained solid, although signs of cooling were apparent.  Commercial real estate markets continued to weaken, with vacancy rates rising and lease prices falling.  Bank contacts reported ongoing reductions in commercial loan demand and some slowing in the pace of nonresidential consumer borrowing.
Ongoing weakness in labor markets further eased wage and salary pressures in the District during the most recent survey period.  Wage increases were scant across sectors, and contacts noted that many firms now have cancelled year-end bonus programs scheduled earlier in the year.  On the benefit side, employers noted rapid increases in employee health-care costs  this year--15 percent to 20 percent higher than last year.  A number of contacts noted that employees are being asked to absorb a portion of these increases.
Respondents in the services sector noted that the demand for IT services and software development and accounting, financial, and legal services remained soft in recent weeks.  Public relations and advertising firms got a boost from national and local election campaigns and from retailers gearing up for the holiday selling season.  District travel and tourism sectors remained weak in October and early November, despite generally favorable weather conditions--early snows and cold conditions in ski areas and warmer-than-average weather in Northern and Southern California.  Domestic tourism mostly has returned to pre-September 11 levels, though international visitor counts remain weak.
Residential real estate markets in the District remained solid in recent weeks, although the pace of sales and price appreciation slowed, especially at the high end of the market.  The slower pace of activity damped residential construction in many District states.  In the San Francisco Bay Area, construction on some multifamily housing projects was put on hold.  Elsewhere in the District, start times for several residential developments have been pushed back until the economy improves.
