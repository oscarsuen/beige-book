Contacts reported that the Sixth District's economy remained                   sluggish during October and early November. Retail sales were                   lackluster overall, and auto sales were well below last year's                   robust levels. Most housing markets continued to exhibit strength,                   although softness persisted in the high-end segment. Commercial                   real estate markets continued to suffer from low demand and                   vacancy rates remained high. Outside the defense sector, manufacturing                   activity in the District was generally subdued. Most reports                   on tourism and business travel continued to be disappointing.                   Labor market conditions showed little improvement over the month,                   with many businesses continuing to seek cost savings rather                   than expanding payrolls. Price increases remained limited.
Auto sales declined sharply from year-ago levels in October.  A number of dealers that handle domestic brands indicated that October had been one of the weakest months of this year. Several dealers said that buyers were less encouraged by the new round of factory incentives than they had been in the past.  Some dealers of Japanese and Korean makes reported shortages caused by the disruption of shipments through West Coast ports.  Contacts also noted that in Louisiana sales were adversely affected by two tropical storms that erased six selling days from the month.  Through September, District's new vehicle registrations remained below comparable levels last year, despite gains in light truck registrations.
