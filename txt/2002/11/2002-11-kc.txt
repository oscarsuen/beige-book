The Tenth District economy showed some signs of improvement in late October and early November after slowing earlier in the fall.  Retail sales excluding autos rose somewhat, the manufacturing sector appeared to stabilize, and energy activity edged up.  In addition, housing activity remained solid across most of the District.  On the negative side, however, auto sales continued to decline, commercial real estate markets weakened further, and layoff announcements remained higher than a few months ago.  In the farm economy, recent rains helped alleviate some of the difficulties caused by the drought.  Wage and price pressures were generally subdued.
