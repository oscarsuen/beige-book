Reports from Seventh District contacts generally suggested                   that economic activity remained soft in October and early November.                   Consumer spending softened somewhat in recent weeks, weighed                   down by lower light vehicle sales. Home sales remained robust,                   while nonresidential activity was again weak. Manufacturing                   activity remained relatively weak. In a familiar refrain, lending                   activity was again strong on the consumer side and soft on the                   business side. Labor markets remained fairly slack, and demand                   for new workers was said to be very soft. As the fall harvest                   neared completion, crop production forecasts were increased                   slightly for the District, though output was still expected                   to be down from a year ago.
