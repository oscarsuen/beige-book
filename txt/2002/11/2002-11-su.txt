Consumer spending varied among Federal Reserve               Districts. There was some improvement in general merchandise sales               in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and               Dallas. Sales were weak in Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and               San Francisco. Auto sales have fallen in all Districts. Service               industry activity was generally sluggish. Manufacturing remained               soft in most Districts, but Philadelphia and Minneapolis noted some               improvement. Business capital spending in all sectors continued               to be limited. Commercial real estate markets continued to be slack               in all the Districts reporting on this sector. Residential real               estate remained strong, although New York, Chicago, and Dallas saw               some signs of easing demand for housing. Agricultural conditions               have been adversely affected by heavy rain and cold weather in southern               parts of the nation but are good elsewhere. There has been little               change in energy production but mining has declined. Bank lending               remains strong for residential real estate, but other categories               of lending have been lackluster.
Labor markets continued to be soft in nearly all               Federal Reserve Districts, although demand for health-care workers               remained strong. Wage and salary pressures were subdued, but employee               health-care costs continued to rise sharply. Most Reserve Banks               reported nearly steady prices at both the consumer and producer               levels, with the exception of shipping charges, which have risen               in the wake of the West Coast port disruptions.
All the Districts reporting on auto sales noted               declines in October compared with the same month last year and compared               with the sales rate set during most of the year until October. The               slower sales rate continued in November, and some further declines               were noted in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. Dealer               inventories have increased. In the Philadelphia and St. Louis Districts,               dealers said inventories were too high, but dealers in the Chicago               and San Francisco Districts said inventories were not excessive               despite the increase.
Tourism activity has been mixed. Boston, Richmond,               Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported that recent tourist travel,               lodging, and spending had increased from last year in most parts               of their Districts. Chicago indicated flat tourism. In the Atlanta,               Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, travel and tourism have been               weaker this year than last, although Atlanta noted that advance               bookings for winter cruises were strong.
Trucking firms in the St. Louis District still               have large backlogs resulting from the West Coast port disruptions.               Delays in receiving shipments were reported from Boston and Philadelphia,               although deliveries in those Districts appeared to be getting back               to normal. Atlanta-area retailers remain concerned about getting               all their holiday merchandise delivered before Christmas. Also in               the Atlanta District, Asian motor vehicles and parts have been in               short supply because of the West Coast shipping interruption and               slowdown. Dallas reported that transportation activity in the District               was at low levels. In Cleveland and Kansas City, there were few               reports of difficulties obtaining shipments.
Conditions varied among specific goods-producing               sectors. Boston and Chicago indicated that capital goods industries               had flat or falling sales. Producers of industrial equipment were               seeing improved demand in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts.               Philadelphia and Dallas noted declining orders for construction               materials. Orders at defense plants have increased according to               Boston and Atlanta. New York noted a fairly broad rebound in the               manufacturing sector. In general, manufacturers have been producing               below capacity, and they have been implementing cost-reduction measures               to maintain profitability.
Among the Districts reporting on manufacturing               inventories, there was no clear pattern. Manufacturers in the Philadelphia               and Cleveland Districts have reduced inventories recently. Inventories               remained low among manufacturers in the San Francisco District.               Chicago District manufacturers had recent increases in inventories               but generally described inventory levels as "fair."
Residential real estate markets continued to be               strong in the majority of Districts. There has been little change               in the pace of home sales in Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, St.               Louis, and Kansas City. In the Cleveland District home builders               have been exceeding planned construction rates, and home building               in the Minneapolis District is ahead of last year's pace. Residential               real estate markets remained "solid" in San Francisco, but growth               of new home construction has slowed. Both San Francisco and Atlanta               reported some weakening in demand for homes in the higher price               ranges. Three Districts indicated that residential markets were               softening: New York, Chicago, and Dallas. In the Chicago and Dallas               Districts cancellations of house-construction contracts have increased.
Cleveland, Dallas, and San Francisco reported             that deposits have been growing at banks and other depository institutions             in their Districts, but Kansas City indicated that deposits in that             District have been flat. Philadelphia noted that sales of annuities             have been growing in that District as investors look to increase their             returns but are reluctant to make further commitments in the stock             market.
Wage and salary pressures remain subdued. Kansas             City indicated that wage pressures were virtually nonexistent. Dallas             noted that temporary help wages have been flat or declining. San Francisco             reported that many firms in that District were canceling usual year-end             bonuses. Although wage and salary trends have been weak, increases             in employee health-care costs have been large and widespread.
In the industrial sector prices have changed             little. Manufacturers' selling prices have been flat to down, and             prices for software and information technology services have been             practically unchanged in Boston. Manufacturers' selling prices have             declined in New York, although input costs have risen. Manufacturers'             input costs and output prices have been mainly unchanged in Philadelphia.             Manufacturers in the Chicago District said they have little pricing             power.
Minneapolis reported modest price increases             generally, and Dallas noted more price reductions than increases.             San Francisco noted that truckers, marine shipping companies, and             air freight companies have imposed extra charges related to shipping             delays occasioned by the West Coast port problems.
