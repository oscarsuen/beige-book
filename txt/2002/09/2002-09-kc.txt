Growth in the Tenth District                 economy showed some signs of moderating in late July and August,                 although business contacts remained generally optimistic about                 future economic activity. Consumer spending was not quite as strong                 as earlier in the year, the recovery in manufacturing appeared                 to lose some momentum, and some commercial real estate markets                 weakened further. On the positive side, residential construction                 remained solid, and energy activity held on to previous gains.                 In the farm economy, corn and soybean crops were in bad condition                 due to the drought. As in previous surveys, wage and retail price                 pressures were virtually nonexistent, while prices for some manufacturing                 materials continued to increase.
The recovery in district manufacturing activity appeared to                     pause in late July and August, with factory activity showing                     fewer signs of improvement than in previous surveys. Production                     and shipments remained a little below year-ago levels following                     steady increases during most of the first half of the year.                     Most firms were operating at moderate levels of capacity, and                     plant managers said they expected factory activity to increase                     over the next six months. However, firms continued to show little                     enthusiasm for new hiring or capital spending, saying they were                     waiting for further signs of improvement in the overall economy                     before making any major new commitments.
