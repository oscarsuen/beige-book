Growth in the Tenth District                 economy showed some signs of moderating in late July and August,                 although business contacts remained generally optimistic about                 future economic activity. Consumer spending was not quite as strong                 as earlier in the year, the recovery in manufacturing appeared                 to lose some momentum, and some commercial real estate markets                 weakened further. On the positive side, residential construction                 remained solid, and energy activity held on to previous gains.                 In the farm economy, corn and soybean crops were in bad condition                 due to the drought. As in previous surveys, wage and retail price                 pressures were virtually nonexistent, while prices for some manufacturing                 materials continued to increase.
