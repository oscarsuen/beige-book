Recovery in the Eighth                 District continues at a slow pace. Contacts in manufacturing report                 few new hires, although some firms plan to expand in or relocate                 to the District. Some contacts report that they are restructuring                 with few or no layoffs. The services sector shows moderate growth,                 with increased activity, particularly in tourism. Retail and auto                 sales in July and August increased slightly over 2001 levels.                 Sales of new homes have increased in several District locations,                 but conditions in commercial real estate markets are mixed. In                 the last three months, demand for commercial and industrial loans                 has declined, while demand for residential mortgages, consumer                 loans, and credit cards has remained mostly unchanged. In the                 agricultural sector, estimates of crop yields for the upcoming                 harvest are expected to be below year-ago levels throughout most                 of the District.
Car dealers in the District report that sales                   in July and August were up slightly, on average, compared with                   the same period in 2001. Several contacts note that sales of                   used and low-end vehicles were accounting for a relatively higher-than-normal                   percentage of car sales, although the rebates and financing                   incentives are holding consumers' interest in new automobiles.                   Overall, most dealers reported desirable inventory levels for                   all vehicles. One third of the dealers surveyed noted higher                   rejection rates of financing applications, while the rest saw                   no change. Three fourths of contacts are optimistic about fall                   sales, expecting to see growth over last year.
The services sector is showing moderate growth,                   District wide, although several contacts noted that firms are                   not planning to add new jobs in the next few months. A few contacts                   noted increased activity also in tourism and the construction                   of new hotels and restaurants. Reports from the distribution                   and logistics sector are mixed. While there has been an increase                   in ground transportation activity over 2001, air delivery operations                   are below last year's levels. Advertising revenues are also                   reported to be up. Contacts in the healthcare sector report                   that the nursing shortage continues to be a problem.
Residential construction opportunities have                   tracked sales, with July monthly and year-to-date building permit                   levels up in most of the District. Commercial construction opportunities                   are mixed. Expansions of colleges, churches, and hospitals are                   driving most of the commercial construction projects in central                   Kentucky and Arkansas. Contacts in Memphis and St. Louis do                   not anticipate many new commercial construction projects due                   to the oversupply of commercial space.
While rainfall in mid-August helped to improve                   the dry conditions in many locales, the lack of adequate moisture                   has hampered development of the soybean crop and accelerated                   the maturation process of the corn crop. As a result, harvesting                   of the corn crop is under way in the southern regions of the                   District.
