Reports from Twelfth District                 contacts indicate modest economic growth in late July and August,                 with substantial variation in conditions across and within sectors.                 Wage and price increases were limited. Respondents noted solid                 consumer demand for automobiles and other big-ticket items, but                 sales of other retail trade and service items generally were flat                 to down. Orders and sales of most high-tech and other manufacturing                 products were sluggish, with excess capacity still a concern.                 In agricultural markets, despite solid overall conditions, some                 producers struggled with adverse supply factors, while energy                 markets saw stable supply. Demand for commercial real estate was                 weak, with rents falling further in some markets, but residential                 demand remained solid. Financial institutions saw weak demand                 for business loans, and they tightened credit standards for riskier                 business loan applicants.
Conditions also were mixed in the District's                       service sectors. In Hawaii's tourism sector, weak counts for                       international visitors were largely offset by strong domestic                       travel, bringing the sector close to year-earlier performance                       levels. However, travel demand elsewhere was generally weak,                       with slight additional deterioration reported for the San Francisco                       Bay Area; some airlines faced financial difficulties due to                       weak demand for air travel. Providers of telecommunications                       services struggled with their bottom lines and implemented further                       layoffs in some areas. However, demand for health services expanded                       further, and improved demand and firming prices were noted for                       broadcast advertising.
