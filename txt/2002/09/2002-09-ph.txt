The upward trend in business                 activity in the Third District that has been building since the                 beginning of the year appeared to ease in August. Manufacturers                 reported steady shipments and orders after several months of growth.                 Retail sales of general merchandise moved down from July to August,                 although there were scanty year-over-year gains in both months.                 Auto sales have been steady. Tourism activity fell in July and                 August after a strong June. Bank loan volumes have edged down,                 as gains in residential mortgages have been offset by declines                 in other types of loans. Commercial real estate markets continued                 to ease. Home sales have slipped since spring, although they continue                 at a fairly strong pace.
Third District businesses contacted in August                   have positive outlooks, although many feel that prospects for                   the immediate future have become more uncertain. A significant                   number of those surveyed for this report said business and consumer                   confidence has become more fragile recently. Manufacturers forecast                   increases in shipments and orders during the next six months,                   but their capital spending plans are not as strong as they were                   earlier this year. Retailers expect slight gains in sales this                   fall, but they are also looking for ways to cut costs in order                   to maintain profitability. Bankers generally expect overall                   loan demand to remain flat, unless business confidence improves                   and firms step up borrowing. Real estate contacts anticipate                   steady residential sales, but they do not foresee improvement                   in commercial markets until next year.
The region's manufacturers forecast improving                   business conditions over the next six months, although their                   level of optimism has slipped somewhat since the first half                   of the year. Half of the firms surveyed in August expect increases                   in orders and shipments during the next six months, while just                   under one in 10 anticipate decreases. In line with their positive,                   but more modest, outlook, area manufacturers' capital spending                   plans call for increases, on balance, but the number of firms                   that have scheduled stepped-up expenditures has declined in                   recent months.
Retailers said the outlook was uncertain,                   but they expect some improvement, especially in apparel sales,                   once cooler weather takes hold. Auto sales showed no signs of                   weakening seriously, according to dealers, but price increases                   and fewer incentives on 2003 models could result in a drop in                   the sales rate during the fall.
Bankers in the Third District expect overall                   lending to remain flat in the absence of a pickup in commercial                   and industrial lending, which they say is unlikely until business                   confidence improves or firms are faced with pressing needs to                   increase capital spending. Bankers see no signs that mortgage                   demand is softening, although many express concern that the                   current pace of real estate activity cannot persist if overall                   economic growth in the region slows down.
Third District commercial real estate markets have continued                   to ease. The most recent surveys by area real estate firms indicated                   that vacancy rates have increased 1 to 2 percentage points since                   spring in most markets. The office vacancy rate in the Philadelphia                   central business district is estimated at around 14 percent.                   The vacancy rate in most suburban markets is estimated to be                   higher, at around 20 percent. Effective rental rates have eased                   as building owners have expanded capital commitments, such as                   building improvements and free rent periods, for tenants. Contacts                   in commercial real estate believe markets will improve slightly,                   but probably not until some time in 2003, after a number of                   buildings currently under construction are completed and lease                   up.
Residential real estate agents generally reported                   an easing in the rate of sales of both new and existing homes                   in July and August, although the number of sales in those months                   was still said to be relatively high by recent standards. Price                   appreciation remains rapid in many parts of the region. Builders                   and real estate agents said supply and demand for homes in the                   region appear to be coming into balance, however. They expect                   some reduction in the rate of price increases and a steady pace                   of sales.
