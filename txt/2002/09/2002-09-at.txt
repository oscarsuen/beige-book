Sixth District contacts                 noted a modest improvement in economic activity in July and August,                 whereas assessments of future prospects were mixed. Retail sales                 increased, led by autos and positive back-to-school sales. Housing                 markets remained strong overall, while commercial real estate                 markets continued to stabilize. Manufacturing output improved                 slightly. Contacts reported that leisure travel had returned to                 healthier levels, but business travel in the region remained weak.                 Labor market conditions were largely unchanged, while price pressures                 remained limited to a few areas.
Most reports from the tourism and hospitality sector noted some                   recent improvement in leisure travel in August. However, more                   of Florida's visitors were reportedly traveling by car than                   by air, and the duration of visits has declined. Contacts reported                   that sluggish European and South American economies cut into                   international travel to the state, although some reports indicated                   increasing numbers of visitors from Brazil. Mississippi's gaming                   industry continued to attract customers reluctant to fly to                   other destinations. Record revenues for Mississippi Gulf Coast                   casinos were reported for July. Business travel remained weak.                   In Atlanta and New Orleans, attendance at some recent large                   business conventions was substantially below that of a year                   ago.
Summer rains improved the agricultural outlook in Florida, Louisiana                   and Mississippi, but drought conditions remained a problem for                   farmers in parts of Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee. Stronger                   cotton and corn prices were benefiting those producers not severely                   impacted by the drought.
