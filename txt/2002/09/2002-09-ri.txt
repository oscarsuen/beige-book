Outside of continued strength                 in District housing markets, and a pickup in retail activity in                 some areas, there were only scattered signs of growth in the Fifth                 District's economy in July and August. Manufacturing activity                 was essentially flat; shipments edged lower and new orders were                 unchanged. Services firms' revenues also were flat, and retail                 sales growth strengthened in some areas but was sluggish in others.                 Residential mortgage lending rose as mortgage interest rates continued                 to trend down, while commercial lending remained weak. District                 home sales were strong, but with the exception of some pickup                 in retail leasing, commercial real estate activity was little                 changed. Price inflation remained modest throughout the District's                 economy. In agriculture, recent rainfall helped crops, but prolonged                 hot and dry weather during much of the summer reduced corn and                 soybean yield prospects and distressed pastures.
According to commercial realtors, leasing                   and construction activity in the Fifth District remained generally                   flat in recent weeks. Many brokers attributed the market's inertia                   to seasonal factors--a contact in Washington, D.C., noted that                   "potential customers were focusing on vacations, not deals."                   By sector, demand was weak for office and industrial space,                   but interest in retail space edged higher--a Columbia, S.C.,                   realtor reported that "high-end retail establishments" continued                   to perform well. Vacancy rates stabilized in the retail sector,                   but continued to creep up in the office and industrial sectors.                   Commercial rental rates changed little, but contacts in the                   Carolinas and Northern Virginia reported the re-emergence of                   landlord concessions in the office and industrial sectors.
