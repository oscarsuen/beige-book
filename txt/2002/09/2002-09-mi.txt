The Ninth District economy                 appears to have grown very little from mid-July through August.                 Agriculture, residential construction and tourism grew. Output                 was flat, however, in the energy and mining sectors, consumer                 spending was level, and commercial construction and manufacturing                 contracted. Over this period, labor markets were mixed, while                 wages and prices were stable. Significant price increases were                 noted in insurance and housing.
In contrast, home building and real estate                   activity were solid. District housing units authorized were                   up 8 percent for the three-month period ending in July compared                   with a year ago. More home sales were closed in the Minneapolis-St.                   Paul area in July than in any month during the past five years.                   Home builders in Grand Forks, N.D., were busier than last year,                   according to a contractor. However, Minneapolis-St. Paul apartment                   vacancy rates were twice as high as last year. Furthermore,                   recent home foreclosures were above last year's levels in the                   Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
Mall managers reported that sales were generally                   weak. In the St. Paul-Minneapolis area two mall managers reported                   that recent sales were flat to slightly higher than last year.                   Retail sales were down slightly in July from last year at a                   North Dakota mall; however, foot traffic in August was strong.                   A Montana mall manager reported flat sales in July compared                   with a year ago. However, same-store sales at a South Dakota                   mall were up 5 percent in July, and were up about 3 percent                   to 5 percent in August from last year, according to a mall manager.
A Montana car dealer reported record sales                   for the month of Julyâ€”15 percent higher than last year. Recent                   car sales were robust at dealerships in South Dakota, according                   to an auto dealers association representative.
Summer tourism activity was strong. July and                   August tourism activity was up 3 percent to 5 percent compared                   with a year ago in the Duluth, Minn., area due to active convention                   business and leisure travel. In northwestern Wisconsin, recent                   visitor numbers and resort bookings were higher than a year                   ago. Visits to Mt. Rushmore and state parks in South Dakota                   were up 8 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in July compared                   with a year ago. A tourism official in Montana predicted a 1                   percent to 2 percent increase for 2002 in nonresident travelers                   compared with last year. Visits to Yellowstone and Glacier National                   parks were up from last summer.
Meanwhile, a call center in the Upper Peninsula                   of Michigan is expected to hire 60 more people. In North Dakota                   a children's play equipment producer recently announced plans                   to add 100 new jobs.
Price increases were also moderate, with significant                   increases noted in health insurance and home prices. A bank                   director noted slight increases in overall prices, but significantly                   increased health insurance costs compared with last year. The                   median home sale price in the St. Paul-Minneapolis area was                   up 8.6 percent in July over a year ago.
