Overall Eleventh District                 economic growth appears to have stalled in late July and August.                 While some sectors, such as high-tech manufacturing and business                 services, continued to show signs of recovery, other areas, such                 as construction and construction-related manufacturing, appeared                 to contract. While most respondents expect the economy to continue                 to slowly recover, many contacts expressed concern that the recovery                 is very fragile and that war with Iraq or another major terrorist                 event could lead to declines in activity. Manufacturing activity                 was flat or slightly down, and retail sales growth weakened slightly.                 Construction and real estate activity softened further. Energy                 activity was flat. There was also little change in financial conditions.                 Demand for business services continued to show signs of slowly                 improving, although the airline industry continues to suffer.                 Rain helped crop and pasture conditions, but drought remains a                 serious problem in some areas.

Spot prices of West Texas Intermediate crude                   oil remained in a range of $26 to $28 per barrel, except for                   late August when they briefly moved over $30 per barrel. Fears                   of war with Iraq, falling Iraqi output, and tightening inventories                   have supported the price of crude oil, with the "war premium"                   variously estimated at $2 to $6 per barrel. Natural gas prices                   stayed under $3.00 per million Btu, except when oil prices moved                   over $30 per barrel in late August. Natural gas inventories                   have declined slightly but remain 11 percent above their five-year                   average and are expected to be at record high levels as the                   heating season begins. Gasoline prices were mostly unchanged.                   Petrochemical prices continued to rise for polyethylene, polypropylene                   and polyvinyl chloride, but producers do not expect the upward                   pressure on chemical prices to continue. Prices of new homes                   have not declined, but there are more concessions and giveaways.                   The rising inventory of homes in all price ranges is putting                   downward pressure on home prices according to some contacts.
Sales were unchanged for glass, primary and                   fabricated metals and food products. Domestic demand for paper                   products was unchanged, but foreign demand was up, particularly                   from Europe. Another El Paso apparel plant is scheduled to close                   in September, because production is moving out of the United                   States.
Gasoline demand has been strong, and refiners                   on the Gulf Coast kept output unchanged, with capacity utilization                   at 93 to 95 percent. Strong imports helped keep inventories                   about 3 percent above last year's levels.
The high-tech industry continued to slowly                   improve. There has been a broad-based pickup in the demand for                   semiconductors, except to supply business computers. Inventories                   are in good shape and, while semiconductor prices remained soft,                   there are signs of firming. A manufacturer of cordless phones                   reported double-digit sales growth. However, there has been                   little change in the telecommunications industry, and layoffs                   continue to be reported.
Demand for air travel remained at very low                   levels. Business travel has been particularly weak, and airlines                   are no longer able to charge a premium to these travelers, slashing                   revenues. The industry is concerned that business travel may                   remain weak for some time. Airlines are reorganizing to make                   more efficient use of capital and labor.
