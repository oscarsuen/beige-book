Economic activity in the                 Second District has remained sluggish since the last report, except                 in the housing sector, which continued to show strength. Prices                 of goods and services generally remain stable. Hiring remains                 lethargic, though some signs of a pickup were noted in late August.                 Retail sales were on or below plan in August, though some improvement                 was noted in the second half of the month. Most retailers describe                 inventory levels as favorable and report somewhat less discounting                 than a year ago.
Manufacturers indicate tepid business conditions,                   with weakness in July followed by a mild rebound in August;                   business contacts remain optimistic about the near-term outlook,                   though somewhat less so than in the second quarter. Housing                   markets have remained strong, with both construction and resale                   activity described as brisk. Office markets in and around New                   York City remain slack but have stabilized somewhat. Robust                   demand for industrial and warehouse space is reported in northern                   New Jersey. Finally, bankers report a pickup in demand for residential                   and commercial mortgages but weakening demand for consumer loans;                   they also report continued tightening in lending standards and                   stable delinquency rates.
A major regional discount chain, already in                   bankruptcy, recently announced that it will liquidate its inventory                   and close all 85 of its stores in New York and four in northern                   New Jersey; these stores reportedly employ approximately 5,000                   sales associates. Separately, a leading wholesaler of women's                   apparel reports that the business climate is increasingly difficult,                   with sales volume and merchandise costs holding steady but declining                   prices hurting margins and forcing some staff reductions. This                   contact attributed this to weakening consumer demand for clothing                   and consolidation in the retail industry.
Regional surveys of consumer confidence gave                   mixed but generally weak readings in August. According to the                   Conference Board, confidence in the Middle Atlantic region fell                   to a cyclical low in August, mainly reflecting a steep drop                   in consumers' assessment of current conditions. Separately,                   a survey of New York State residents, conducted by Siena College,                   indicates that confidence rebounded modestly in August, following                   a steep decline in July, though it remained at a relatively                   low level.
Tourism was fairly lively this past summer.                   Manhattan hotels report that occupancy rates were steady in                   July and roughly the same as a year earlier, though average                   room rates were down 10 percent from a year earlier. There were                   said to be more leisure visitors this year but fewer business                   travelers. Separately, resort areas north of Albany report that                   business was relatively good over the summer.
Similarly, the resale market across metropolitan                   New York City continues to be robust. In the second quarter,                   prices of single-family homes were up 10-15 percent from a year                   earlier, based on a repeat-sales index, and real estate contacts                   indicate that this strength appears to have followed through                   into the third quarter. Sales of Manhattan co-ops and condos                   are also described as strong, though the rate of price appreciation                   has been more subdued. A leading appraisal firm reports that                   August was its busiest month ever, reflecting both a large number                   of sales transactions and a flood of refinancing activity. Contacts                   indicate that New York City's apartment rental market has stabilized,                   but that rents remain considerably lower than a year ago. Rising                   vacancy rates and falling rents are also reported along northern                   New Jersey's "Gold Coast", which is across the river from Manhattan.
Commercial real estate markets have been mixed.                   New York City's office market continued to slacken since the                   last report, though the pace has moderated noticeably. Availability                   rates edged up in July, while asking rents were steady in Midtown                   but continued to decline in Lower Manhattan. Overall, asking                   rents are down roughly 10 percent from a year ago, though actual                   contract rents are reported to be down by at least 20 percent.                   In contrast, northern New Jersey's industrial market has shown                   signs of strengthening, buoyed by robust demand for warehouse                   space. Brisk activity at Port Newark and Port Elizabeth is seen                   as a major force underpinning this market.
Recent surveys of purchasing managers and                   manufacturers suggest a moderate rebound in the manufacturing                   sector in August. Buffalo-area purchasers report a slight improvement                   in business conditions in August--while production activity                   weakened, new orders rebounded following a slump in July. Purchasing                   managers in the New York City area report widespread strength                   in the manufacturing sector in August, but continued sluggish                   conditions in other sectors; they also expressed less optimism                   about the near-term outlook than in recent months. Purchasers                   in both areas report little change in input prices. Separately,                   our latest monthly survey of New York State manufacturers indicates                   a moderate rebound in business activity in August, following                   a dip in activity in July, though improvement was a good deal                   less widespread than in the second quarter. However, respondents                   remain overwhelmingly optimistic about the near-term business                   outlook.
Finally, a trucking-industry expert notes                   that the recently announced bankruptcy of a major national carrier                   is not expected to have a dramatic effect on the industry overall.                   This contact notes that, aside from substantial escalation in                   insurance costs, the industry has not had major problems and                   that the firm's business and most of its drivers will likely                   move to other companies.
On the supply side, bankers continue to report                   tightening credit standards for commercial and industrial loans                   and nonresidential mortgages, but little change in credit standards                   for consumer lending and residential mortgages. Both loan and                   deposit rates continued to decrease across all categories. Declining                   rates were particularly widespread on home mortgages. Lenders                   report stable delinquency rates for all types of loans.
