The New England economy                 is moving sideways, on net, with some sectors level to down and                 others up modestly. Manufacturers report flat revenues; retailers                 and tourism contacts say business is slow. Commercial real estate                 markets are depressed in the Boston area and flat elsewhere in                 the region. Software and IT markets are still "tough." The outlook                 remains uncertain.
Retail contacts are mostly holding headcounts                   level, although some are choosing not to fill open positions.                   Wages are generally steady, but one respondent implemented an                   increase of 3 percent. Vendor prices and selling prices are                   mostly flat. New England hotels, restaurants, and tourism companies                   continue to offer special pricing and package deals. Capital                   spending remains modest. Many respondents are being cautious,                   with some scaling back marketing expenses and one putting large-scale                   IT projects on hold indefinitely.
Overall, contacted retailers have low expectations                   for the remainder of the year. Many hope the upcoming months                   will be profitable, but few anticipate growth.
Selling prices and materials costs are mostly                   flat to down, and contacts report that they and their customers                   are bargaining for extended payment terms. Responding firms                   face ongoing sharp increases in insurance costs and recent increases                   for steel and plastics. Manufacturers raising their selling                   prices to cover rising costs say the increases have been less                   than desired because of competitive pressures.
The majority of manufacturers have reduced                   employment during the past year and expect to make only minor                   adjustments in headcounts during the remainder of 2002. Some                   companies lifted pay freezes or reversed reductions at midyear                   or have plans to do so in 2003. Where they are occurring, pay                   increases are typically 2 to 3 percent. Responding companies                   generally report that capital spending remains modest. Most                   seem reluctant to spend while the economy remains weak or uncertain.                   The only exception—a company embarking on the largest initiative                   in its history—is doing so to save on labor inputs.
Most contacts believe their sales will be                   fairly flat over the next six to 12 months and that they will                   face pressure on net income. A couple of capital goods producers                   indicate that conditions are unlikely to turn around before                   late 2003 or sometime in 2004.
Temp industry profits are depressed as costs                   for workers' compensation, unemployment insurance, and wages                   move up while clients maintain downward pressure on bill rates.                   Both year-round and seasonal labor remain plentiful. Most contacts                   were overwhelmed with summer job inquiries from students but                   had few openings for them. Respondents are cautiously optimistic                   that business will pick up in the fourth quarter; they expect                   to inch rather than surge forward for the remainder of the year.
Commercial real estate respondents do not                   anticipate any major changes during the next six months, provided                   there is no deterioration in overall economic conditions. Boston-area                   contacts do not see signs that the market will improve this                   year.
Producers of human resources software, custom                   applications development, and program development tools report                   either flat or 5 to 10 percent growth in employment. All cite                   significantly reduced turnover rates, with one company claiming                   one-quarter of the turnover in the past few years. None of the                   responding firms plan to cut back their capital budgets. While                   the contacted companies are generally gaining, their senior                   executives note that sales and profits of some competitors are                   down by as much as 20 to 50 percent. Thus, they believe the                   market for IT and software products is still "tough," with the                   rebound slower than expected. Most respondents express cautious                   optimism for growth in the next 12 months, but admit that their                   outlook has either remained unchanged or been revised down since                   May.
