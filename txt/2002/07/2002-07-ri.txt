Fifth District commercial leasing and construction activity changed little since our last report. Realtors attributed the sluggishness of commercial activity to ongoing uncertainty over economic prospects. The office sector was particularly stagnant in recent weeks. A contact in Columbia, S.C., noted that despite lease renewals by many firms, absorption rates have not increased in that area. Activity in the industrial sector was also generally flat--but the level of activity varied by space type and location. A Northern Virginia industrial broker reported that traditional warehouse space continued to generate more interest than "flex space"--an office-industrial hybrid. Retail sector activity was mostly subdued across most of the Fifth District, but pockets of strength were recorded in Virginia and South Carolina. Rental rates and vacancy rates generally stabilized across the retail and industrial sectors, but weakened somewhat in the office sector.
