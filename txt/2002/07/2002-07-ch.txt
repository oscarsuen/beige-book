Reports from Seventh District contacts suggested that the pace                 of the region's economic recovery remained slow in June and July.                 Reports on consumer spending became more mixed in recent weeks,                 as sales results varied widely by retail segment. The demand for                 housing remained very strong, while conditions in nonresidential                 construction and real estate were still soft. The recovery in                 manufacturing was uneven across industry segments. Overall lending                 activity was buoyed by strong demand for residential mortgages,                 while business loan demand remained low. Labor market conditions                 were mixed across the District, and employers were reluctant to                 take on new hires. Crop conditions in the Midwest have varied                 widely but, on average, appeared substantially less positive than                 a year ago.
