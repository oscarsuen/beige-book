Eleventh District economic activity grew very slowly in June                 and the first half of July. Caution is percolating through the                 economy, with respondents expressing concern about the stock market,                 recent corporate scandals, and terrorism. Several contacts said                 their firms have customers who are interested in doing business--are                 financially ready to do deals--but need more confidence to go                 forward. Manufacturing and service sector activity was expanding                 slowly. Retail sales were weak, and construction and real estate                 activity remained soft. Energy activity flattened, after having                 increased strongly in the spring. Contacts in the financial services                 industry said consumer lending was showing signs of softening.                 Heavy rain improved agricultural conditions.
Most industries reported little change in labor markets. The temporary service industry said that wages are flat to declining, and competition is pushing down fees as much as 15 percent. High tech firms reported that, while the market for programmers and other employees has loosened substantially, the job market for engineers is very tight, and employees are no longer willing to accept stock as compensation.
Demand for construction-related materials was mixed. Cement activity was slow due to heavy rains, but contacts expect demand to pick back up soon. Demand for fabricated metal also softened over the past month. Sales were up for clay and brick, with strong demand for residential and government building. Lumber and glass producers reported little change in sales. Demand for primary metals has been improving slightly according to contacts, who say activity is stronger than a year ago. Steel sales have picked up the strongest, thanks to tariff protection.
Demand is up for plastic products. In contrast, refineries reduced capacity utilization to control stocks, which are high. Refiners' margins have improved from the weak levels of this winter but are still well below normal.
Sales of food and apparel products were up. Paper producers say demand has been slowing over the past few months, and customers are reluctant to buy anything other than what is necessary.
Railroads reported a general pickup in activity, although construction shipments have been weak. Trucking shipments have been weak, particularly of construction materials. Demand for air travel remains weak, and some airlines continue to report double-digit declines in passenger loads in comparison with last year, which has led to large revenue shortfalls. Further employment cuts are expected. Contacts say government guarantees are distorting the industry because they are keeping the less efficient airlines alive.
