The First District economy is said to be going through a "bumpy"                 period. Manufacturing reports continue mixed, with makers of defense,                 medical, and automotive equipment and semiconductors doing better                 than producers of IT and telecom equipment or nonmilitary aircraft.                 Retailers are less upbeat than they were in April and May, with                 sales mostly flat or down from year-earlier levels. Results for                 insurance firms vary by sector, while residential real estate                 markets remain strong. Many contacts express caution and uncertainty                 regarding the outlook.
Most retailers are holding employment steady, though several report layoffs and attrition, especially of administrative and sales employees.  Most are granting modest wage increases, with one employer ending a wage freeze in April.  Vendor prices are generally stable; exceptions include high-tech goods continuing a trend of price declines and lumber prices, which have firmed up recently after exhibiting multi-year lows.  Most retailers claim profit margins are stable.
Overall, the contacted retailers have subdued expectations for the remainder of the year compared with their relative optimism a few months ago.  Most express hope for modest growth in their own firm's sales, despite low expectations for the economy overall.  By exception, lumber/hardware sellers look forward to continued good business.  Catching the mood of other respondents, one retailer characterizes the outlook as "imponderable."
Selling prices and materials costs are mostly flat to down.  Prices for plastics, paper, and semiconductors have reportedly firmed in recent months.  Companies report that increased sourcing outside the United States is resulting in lower purchasing costs.
Employment trends are mixed.  Companies that are increasing head counts are doing so cautiously, and some other companies are still cutting jobs. About one-half of the contacted manufacturers have at least selective pay freezes in effect, especially for salaried employees, but some of these firms now plan to raise pay this year.  Reported pay increases are typically around 3 percent.
Responding companies generally report that capital spending remains modest.  Some firms are increasing their equipment purchases in order to improve the quality of their products or processes, or to develop new products in response to changes in technology.
Although quite a few contacts believe that the worst is behind them, the prevailing mood is somewhat subdued.  Respondents say that the recent stock market decline and concerns about corporate accounting irregularities may depress demand for their products.  Some also worry that no upturn is in sight for industries such as IT, aerospace, and telecommunications.
Home prices continued to rise through the second quarter.  Contacts say the increases are especially pronounced in Massachusetts; the other New England states report moderate price increases.  New construction is down in most states because of a lack of available land, with the exception of Maine, where new construction is very active.  Most contacts expect continued strength in housing markets in the short term, with price appreciation slowing down in the second half of the year.
Insurance industry respondents are less optimistic than they were earlier                 in the year, especially when looking at their investments and                 mutual fund sales. Employment in the sector has mainly been flat,                 as many contacts report continued efforts to improve efficiency.                 Most say that they do not expect significant changes in the second                 half of the year. However, those with current sales running higher                 than anticipated foresee some softening of demand and a return                 to expected levels.
