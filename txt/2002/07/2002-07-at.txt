Growth in the District's hospitality and tourism sector moderated as tourist traffic declined in parts of Florida.  The factory sector remained mixed with lackluster new orders and limited spending on new technology.  New car and truck sales in the District continued to lag behind national figures, although recent incentives improved sales.  Single-family housing remained strong, but weakness in the commercial real estate market continued.  Financial institutions noted modest improvement in consumer loan demand, and commercial loan demand remained soft.  Labor markets were little changed, with few companies hiring on a permanent basis.  Price pressures continued to be limited to insurance, healthcare, and steel.
Price pressures continued to be strong for healthcare and insurance.  One contact reported that healthcare costs were expected to increase by double-digits for the third year in a row.  The tariff-induced increase in steel prices adversely affected some District manufacturers.
