Contacts noted generally improved conditions in the District's travel and tourism sectors.  Respondents observed an increase in travel generally; however, hotel occupancy rates still were below year-earlier levels in several areas, including California and Hawaii.
Most respondents indicated that inventories remained stable during the recent survey period.  They also noted little evidence of changes in manufacturers' inventories or shipping patterns in response to concerns about a potential strike at West Coast ports.  Several contacts noted that the weaker dollar appeared to be boosting exports.
In contrast, demand for residential real estate in the District generally remained solid in June through mid-July.  Conditions were very robust in heavily populated Southern California, where house prices and building activity rose.  Contacts in Hawaii also indicated demand for residential real estate was strong.  Respondents in most other areas reported that home sales and prices rose, though less rapidly in recent weeks than earlier in the year.  Contacts reported some softening in selected markets for high-end housing.  In addition, in parts of the District, respondents noted rising vacancy rates and declining rents for multifamily and other rental housing units.  Overall, residential construction activity continued to rise in the District.
