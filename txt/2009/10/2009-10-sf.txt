Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to pick up slightly during   the reporting period of September through early October, with reports pointing   to additional signs of stabilization or improvement in some sectors. Upward   pressures on prices and wages were largely absent. Retail sales remained   sluggish on net, while demand for most services continued to slide. District   manufacturing activity firmed a bit further, although excess capacity remained   unusually high in some sectors. Demand appeared to hold largely steady for   agricultural producers but continued to weaken for providers of natural resource   products. Demand for housing showed further slight improvement, but conditions   continued to deteriorate in commercial real estate markets. Contacts from the   banking industry and other industries reported stable or slightly increased loan   demand and improved credit access.
Contacts generally characterized wages as flat, although some businesses   faced significant increases in the costs of employee benefits. Upward wage   pressures were limited by high unemployment in most areas, and contacts noted   ample availability for hourly and salaried employees alike. Employment cuts and   an ongoing focus on organizational and technological efficiencies have enabled   many businesses to raise productivity and reduce their labor costs this year,   although this has been offset by rising costs of employee health benefits and   retirement plans in some cases.
Demand for services fell further. Activity was very slow for providers of   business services such as consulting and trucking, and reduced passenger volumes   for airlines were attributed in part to ongoing declines in business travel.   Demand and revenues continued to ease for providers of health-care services, as   consumers reportedly have been deferring elective procedures and coinsurance   payments. Restaurant and food service providers continued to struggle with weak   demand, although one contact pointed to a stabilization compared with the steep   declines observed earlier in the year. Conditions remained somewhat mixed but   very challenging on net in the tourism and leisure sector: the steep slide in   hotel and resort visits continued in Southern California and Las Vegas, but   contacts in Hawaii reported continued firming in visitor arrivals and hotel   occupancy rates.
