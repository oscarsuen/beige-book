Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to pick up slightly during   the reporting period of September through early October, with reports pointing   to additional signs of stabilization or improvement in some sectors. Upward   pressures on prices and wages were largely absent. Retail sales remained   sluggish on net, while demand for most services continued to slide. District   manufacturing activity firmed a bit further, although excess capacity remained   unusually high in some sectors. Demand appeared to hold largely steady for   agricultural producers but continued to weaken for providers of natural resource   products. Demand for housing showed further slight improvement, but conditions   continued to deteriorate in commercial real estate markets. Contacts from the   banking industry and other industries reported stable or slightly increased loan   demand and improved credit access. Wages and Prices Upward price pressures were weak to   nonexistent during the reporting period. Commodity prices in general were   stable, although contacts noted that energy prices have been mixed in recent   months, with oil up and natural gas down. Retailers reported that sales prices   were below their levels from 12 months earlier in many cases, and service   providers such as hotel operators, trucking companies, and providers of   professional services reported significant rate cuts in recent months. By   contrast, prices have firmed for computer memory chips as a result of sustained   demand increases this year. Contacts generally characterized wages as flat, although some businesses   faced significant increases in the costs of employee benefits. Upward wage   pressures were limited by high unemployment in most areas, and contacts noted   ample availability for hourly and salaried employees alike. Employment cuts and   an ongoing focus on organizational and technological efficiencies have enabled   many businesses to raise productivity and reduce their labor costs this year,   although this has been offset by rising costs of employee health benefits and   retirement plans in some cases. Retail Trade and Services Sales of retail items other   than automobiles were little changed on net. Reports from retailers of various   types indicated that unit sales and revenues were little changed from prior low   levels; consumers' continued preference for lower-priced options held down sales   of more expensive items in general and contributed to a decline in revenues at   grocery stores. By contrast, contacts pointed to stronger demand and sales for   furniture. Retail inventories generally were reported to be at or near preferred   levels, as most retailers have adjusted to the lower level and changing   composition of demand. Sales of new automobiles and light trucks fell back to   the very low levels that prevailed prior to the August surge resulting from the   Federal government's cash-for-clunkers program. Demand for used automobiles also   weakened during the reporting period; however, because households and rental   companies have been extending their ownership intervals for existing vehicles,   inventories remained lean and prices rose. Demand for services fell further. Activity was very slow for providers of   business services such as consulting and trucking, and reduced passenger volumes   for airlines were attributed in part to ongoing declines in business travel.   Demand and revenues continued to ease for providers of health-care services, as   consumers reportedly have been deferring elective procedures and coinsurance   payments. Restaurant and food service providers continued to struggle with weak   demand, although one contact pointed to a stabilization compared with the steep   declines observed earlier in the year. Conditions remained somewhat mixed but   very challenging on net in the tourism and leisure sector: the steep slide in   hotel and resort visits continued in Southern California and Las Vegas, but   contacts in Hawaii reported continued firming in visitor arrivals and hotel   occupancy rates. Manufacturing District manufacturing activity showed   further signs of improvement but remained at low levels overall during the   reporting period of September through early October. Conditions continued to   improve for manufacturers of semiconductors and other information technology   products, with capacity utilization rates reportedly returning to levels   achieved prior to the recession in some cases. Food manufacturers also reported   strong demand and significant sales gains. By contrast, metal fabricators and   makers of wood products reported no improvement over prevailing conditions of   extreme slack. Activity at petroleum refineries continued to decline as a result   of producers' efforts to reduce excess inventories. Makers of commercial   aircraft and parts reported that new orders were "almost nonexistent," although   ongoing work on the prior backlog has prevented precipitous declines in   deliveries and revenues. Agriculture and Resource-related Industries Demand for   agricultural products was largely unchanged, but it fell further for extractors   of natural resources used for energy production. Sales held largely steady for   most types of agricultural products, and favorable production conditions,   including ample availability of inputs, reportedly have led to excess supply for   some crops and dairy products. Weak demand has caused a reduction in sales and   extraction activity for oil and natural gas; inventories were very high on a   seasonal basis, especially for natural gas, for which inventories reportedly are   approaching storage capacity. Real Estate and Construction Reports suggested that   demand for housing continued to improve slowly, while demand for commercial real   estate eroded further. The pace of home sales picked up further in parts of the   District, accompanied by rising prices in some cases. However, the momentum for   recovery has been undermined by ongoing increases in foreclosure rates, which   have slowed the decline in the inventory of available homes. As a result, new   home construction continued at a very slow pace throughout the District, and   industry contacts noted little or no prospect for a significant pickup in the   near term. Conditions continued to deteriorate in the commercial real estate   market: demand for office and industrial space fell further, and financing for   new development and purchases reportedly remained "frozen." Financial Institutions District banking contacts reported   that loan demand was largely stable or perhaps rose slightly compared with   previous reporting periods. Reports from various areas suggested some pickup in   total loan volumes, although contacts also noted that business loan demand has   been held down by companies' reluctance to make new capital investments before   they observe concrete evidence of a sustained economic recovery. Lending   standards remained relatively restrictive, with scattered reports of further   tightening, especially for commercial real estate lending, and credit quality   continued to deteriorate. However, on net bankers and other contacts noted   improved access to financial capital in recent months.
