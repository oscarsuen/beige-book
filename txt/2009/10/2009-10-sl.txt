Overall, business conditions in the Eighth District have declined since our   last report, and the rate of decline is mostly comparable to that of recent   periods. Manufacturing has continued to decline, the services sector has   experienced a net contraction of jobs, and the retail sector reported mixed   results. Both residential and commercial real estate declined. Banks reported   declines in lending activity. Reports from the agricultural sector were   mixed.
The District's services sector continued to experience contraction in net   jobs. Small firms in business support services and education services announced   a few new hires, but in contrast, several larger firms in business support   services announced reductions in staff due to declining revenues. One firm   closed its facility, and a few others announced pay freezes for their remaining   workers. Contacts in the retail sector reported a mixed outlook. General and big   box retailers began to expand in a few regions, filling in previously vacant   spaces. However, the bankruptcy of a regional grocery retailer led to a   significant number of job losses. Smaller retailers reported a mixed picture,   with a slight increase in sales but dimmed optimism for the remaining months of   this year. Auto dealerships dropped by GM expressed cautious optimism and plan   to sell off their inventory while pursuing additional service opportunities.
Commercial real estate and construction markets struggled throughout the   District. A contact in St. Louis noted that the pace of commercial foreclosures   is increasing. Contacts in St. Louis and Memphis noted that a number of   high-profile properties have recently been foreclosed. A contact in central   Arkansas reported that while commercial construction has been positive thus far   this year, 2010 is projected to be meager at best. Industrial real estate and   construction contacts throughout the District also continued to report a   difficult environment. A contact in Memphis does not expect the industrial real   estate market to improve until late 2010. Contacts throughout the District noted   that no speculative industrial construction is taking place.
