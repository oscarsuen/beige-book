Overall economic activity in the Ninth District was steady with some signs of   recovery. The manufacturing, energy, mining and residential real estate sectors   saw moderate increases. Agriculture, consumer spending and tourism were mixed,   while activity in services was flat. Decreases in activity occurred in   construction and commercial real estate. Labor markets remained weak, but some   signs of improvement were noted. Meanwhile, wage increases were modest, and   overall prices were generally unchanged.
Auto sales slipped in September following the end of the cash-for-clunkers   program. An auto dealer in North Dakota reported that sales dropped to more   typical levels after the program ended. Inventory levels of new cars were down   substantially; some dealers were purchasing newer used vehicles at higher prices   to make up for the lack of new-car inventory.
Tourism activity was mixed. The number of visitors at several attractions in   the Upper Peninsula of Michigan during late summer and early fall was at or   above year-ago levels; however, lodging revenue was down almost 10 percent,   according to a tourism official. Tourism spending in northwestern Montana was   down slightly from a year ago. Meanwhile, attendance at the Minnesota State Fair   during late August and early September was up about 6 percent compared with last   year.
Commercial real estate markets saw continued sluggish activity. A   Minneapolis-St. Paul commercial real estate firm said office subleases have   increased as tenants required less space, and that more landlords were offering   "as-is" deals with lower rents in exchange for fewer amenities. Retail vacancy   remained elevated in markets across the District. Residential real estate showed   signs of improvement, as buyers scrambled to take advantage of the federal   first-time home buyer tax credit before it expires on November 30. Pending sales   in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in September were about 24 percent higher than   levels a year earlier. Home sales fell slightly from last year in Sioux Falls,   while sales in Bismarck, N.D., were about even with last year's strong   levels.
Wage increases remained modest. According to respondents to the recent St.   Cloud (Minn.) Area Business Outlook Survey, 15 percent expect to increase   employee compensation over the next six months, down from 35 percent in last   year's survey.
Overall prices were generally unchanged. Only about 15 percent of respondents   to the St. Cloud survey expect increases in their own product prices over the   next six months, down from 33 percent a year ago. Minnesota gasoline prices   declined 12 cents per gallon in late September from a month earlier and were   down more than $1 per gallon from a year ago. Lower natural gas prices and an   expected mild winter could reduce home heating bills up to 15 percent in the   Midwest.
