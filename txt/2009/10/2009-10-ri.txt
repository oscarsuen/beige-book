Most sectors in the Fifth District reported either mixed or improving   business conditions since our last assessment. Manufacturing continued to lead   most other sectors, with solid increases in orders and shipments and even a   small gain in employment. Services firms also strengthened, although employment   tended to be flat. Finance and real estate (both residential and commercial)   firms reported improvements over the last four-to-six weeks, but weaknesses were   noted especially in industrial real estate. In contrast, the retail sector   tended to be either flat or down in recent weeks.
Temporary employment was   more evenly mixed between reports of strengthening and weakening, but with more   optimism expressed than earlier. Reports of wage and price changes among sectors   indicated little change, although manufacturing and retail price growth slowed   slightly.
Port authorities in the District reported stable-to-moderate gains in both   import and export activity, but expressed concern about their sustainability.   One official saw "light at the end of the tunnel," with month-to-month changes   flattening out. Auto imports picked up as auto companies replenished dealer   stocks. Another official thought that modest gains over the last month might   reverse once the early holiday importing was completed, especially if businesses   kept a tight rein on inventory.
While commercial real estate activity in the District remained depressed,   most real estate agents reported signs of improvement over the last month at   least in terms of expressing interest in long-term expansion. One agent noted an   increase in foot traffic from retailers interested in developing new sites next   year. Few were willing to commit yet, but an increasing number were revisiting   earlier expansion plans that had been put on hold over the last year. Industrial   real estate activity in most areas of the District was often described as   "dead," and new construction of industrial or office buildings was further   deterred by difficulty obtaining financing. Small business startups in Northern   Virginia were also having trouble getting financing, often due to an inability   to meet higher down-payment requirements.
