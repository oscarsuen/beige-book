Economic conditions in the Third District have shown little change in recent   weeks. Manufacturers, on balance, reported a small increase in shipments and a   steady rate of new orders. Retailers indicated that sales picked up for the   back-to-school shopping period, although there was little improvement compared   with a year ago. Motor vehicle dealers indicated that sales declined from August   to September as the federal "cash for clunkers" program terminated. Third   District banks reported flat loan volume, overall, and further declines in   credit quality. Residential real estate agents generally noted steady sales of   existing homes. Nonresidential real estate leasing and construction activity   declined. Business firms in the region reported mostly level input costs and   output prices in September.
The outlook in the Third District business community remained subdued in   September. Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next   six months, on balance, although most of those expecting gains believe that they   will be slight. Retailers are generally cautious. Although some retailers see   signs of rising sales in the fourth quarter, most believe consumers will   continue to limit spending. Auto dealers expect sales to remain slow through the   rest of the year. Bankers anticipate demand for credit to remain soft while   business and consumer confidence continues to be fragile. Residential real   estate contacts believe housing demand will continue to stabilize, but they do   not expect significant improvement until some time next year. Contacts in   nonresidential real estate expect leasing and construction to remain weak into   2010.
Third District manufacturers expect further improvement in business   conditions, on balance. Among the firms polled in September, slightly more than   half expect new orders and shipments to increase during the next six months;   less than one-tenth expect decreases. Although the balance of opinion among area   manufacturers remains positive, most forecast only slight gains. There is a   general view among surveyed firms that their customers will be slow to restock   inventories and purchase capital equipment in the near term. This view is   consistent with area manufacturers' own plans for capital spending, which call   for only steady expenditures, on balance, during the next six months.
Third District auto dealers reported a drop in sales from August to September   as the federal "cash for clunkers" program ended. The August sales boost helped   dealers reduce inventories, but dealers think that the program also pulled sales   into August that might have otherwise occurred in September or later.   Consequently, they expect sales to be slow through the rest of the year.
Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that leasing and purchase activity   declined during the past few months. Vacancy rates continued to rise for   apartments and office, industrial, and retail buildings. Contacts reported that   tenant downsizings and business terminations were resulting in the return of   space to the market. There has also been a substantial increase in sublease   space coming on the market. Rents have declined, especially for older buildings.   Contacts expect nonresidential real estate markets to remain soft for some time.   One contact said, "markets will struggle through the remainder of this year, and   they will still face challenges in 2010."
