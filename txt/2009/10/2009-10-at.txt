On balance, information from Sixth District business contacts suggested that   economic activity pulled back somewhat in September. Retail and tourism-related   spending was below expectations according to most contacts, while automobile   dealers reported that sales had dropped following the expiration of the "cash   for-clunkers" program. Reports from real estate contacts indicated that home   sales continued to improve in most areas, although the pace of the improvement   slowed somewhat in September. Commercial real estate conditions deteriorated   further as vacancy rates rose, rents declined, and more planned commercial   projects were delayed or cancelled. A small majority of manufacturer contacts   noted a modest decline in production and orders in September. Most contacts in   the banking sector reported that credit conditions remained tight. The pace of   layoffs in the District continued to slow, but most contacts also indicated that   they were not looking to hire in the near term. Overall, inflationary pressures   remained subdued, with most contacts noting that input and output prices were   flat to down slightly over the month.
Tourism-related spending in the District remained weak in September. Industry   contacts reported that hotel reservations, particularly related to conventions,   were down. Room rates continued to decline, as well, in most locations.   Cruise-line occupancy rates remained solid. However, this was attributed to very   deep discounting. Hospitality industry contacts expect subdued activity to   persist over the next few months.
Private-sector commercial real estate activity weakened further in September.   Vacancy rates continued to rise across all segments, and contacts continued to   cite downward pressure on rents. Developers reported fewer backlogs, and more   projects were delayed or cancelled. The outlook among contractors remained   unchanged since last reported, with most anticipating activity to continue to   decline into 2010. However, contractors in some parts of the District noted that   federal stimulus monies were starting to help spur some public-sector   activity.
Overall, transportation activity remained weak, with rail shipments of   automobiles being one of the few areas showing improvement. Weak demand and   lower prices were noted as adversely impacting revenues for several regional   trucking companies.
Construction and manufacturing firms reported that several raw material   prices continued to moderate. Real estate contacts noted some further downward   pressure on rents. Once again, most retailers remarked that retail prices   remained stable relative to year-earlier levels.
Unusually high rainfall amounts were reported in most parts of the District.   Floods damaged some of North Georgia's nurseries, vegetable farms, and   commercial vineyards. However, Florida citrus growers benefited from recent   rainfall. Crop conditions were described as generally favorable for cotton,   soybeans, and peanuts in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.
