Economic activity in the Seventh District improved marginally in September   and October. Most contacts reported that the decline in economic activity had   ended, and many remained cautiously optimistic for a recovery over the remainder   of 2009. Business spending and consumer spending excluding autos decreased at a   slower rate, and business and consumer expectations improved. Manufacturing   activity showed some further signs of firming. Residential real estate   conditions continued to improve, while commercial real estate conditions   worsened. Credit conditions, while still tight, also further improved. General   and agricultural price pressures were mixed, while wage pressures were   minimal.
Consumer spending decreased from the   previous reporting period. Auto sales were considerably lower in September after   conclusion of the cash-for-clunkers program, but contacts indicated a pickup in   activity in early October. Used vehicle sales were steadier through September   helping to offset some of the decline in new vehicle purchases. Auto dealers   reported that vehicle inventories remained low, but that they were comfortable   with the level of stocks. Retail sales excluding autos decreased at a slower   rate than during the previous reporting period. Consumers continued to spend   mostly on necessities, but the decline in spending on luxury goods slowed.   Recent trends of higher personal saving rates and trading down to lower-priced   brands were expected to continue to hold back sales, but their impact was seen   as easing. Retailers reported maintaining low inventories; however, contacts   also indicated that expectations for sales during the holiday season had   improved. With customers still price sensitive, retailers also noted efforts to   improve customer service and the shopping experience in order to attract new   business.
The decline in business spending slowed   in September and early October, and the outlook for future spending improved.   Some inventory rebuilding took place in the manufacturing sector, and contacts   generally expected this to continue through 2009. Trucking shipments increased,   although the level of activity remained low. In a sign of rising business   confidence, several contacts also noted an increase in merger and acquisition   activity. Tentative signs of increased interest in structures investment were   reported, and some projects that had been put on hold earlier in the year were   being re-priced with the possibility of moving forward later this fall. Higher   credit standards remained an issue, however. For example, a contact reported   facing much higher equity requirements and much less favorable terms than in the   past. In addition, a contact reported that equipment investment by his firm was   likely to remain on hold despite attractive prices until their labor force   adjustments had ended. Labor market conditions remained weak with hiring limited   outside of healthcare, education, and information technology. However, the rate   of job loss continued to slow as did reductions in hours. Furthermore, a large   staffing firm indicated that billable hours had increased in recent weeks,   particularly in the manufacturing sector.
Construction activity in the   District increased slightly in September and early October. Residential   construction inched up, but a contact noted that most of the building was on   existing developments. Credit remained tight for residential developers.   Residential real estate conditions also improved with home sales increasing and   housing inventory coming down. Contacts noted higher affordability and the   nearing end of the first-time home buyer tax credit as drivers. However, the   availability of financing continued to be a concern for potential home buyers.   Public nonresidential construction was strong with road building and repair   accounting for most of the activity. In contrast, private nonresidential   construction declined, reflecting both weak demand and restrictive credit   conditions.                Commercial construction was particularly weak. Commercial real   estate conditions deteriorated again, as prices fell further and vacancy rates   increased. Contacts reported that lower absorption of retail and office   construction would likely cause vacancy rates to continue to rise. Downward   pressure on commercial rents also intensified and subleasing activity increased   with more tenants seeking to renegotiate their leases.
Manufacturing activity in the District was   slightly improved in September and early October. Lean inventories and stronger   demand from the auto sector led to an increase in demand for steel. A contact in   the steel industry reported that previously idle capacity would be brought back   on as a result, although it would take time to do so. Other metals-related   manufacturers also reported small gains. Automakers expected demand to slowly   improve over the rest of the year and maintained plans to increase production.   The surge in sales in July and August allowed them to favorably alter their   product mix and manage inventories. Automotive suppliers also benefitted from   the increase in auto production; however, several contacts noted that orders   past the fourth quarter were shaping up to be weaker, while others expected   demand to increase slowly over the next six months. The latter pointed to strong   demand from Asia, Mexico, and Europe as reason for cautious optimism. The   decline in sales of heavy equipment flattened out and order flows improved with   demand from Asia particularly strong in recent months. Manufacturers with ties   to housing also noted a leveling out in the decline in activity in their   industries.
Credit conditions, while still tight,   further improved in September and early October. Credit spreads narrowed, and   net corporate funding costs continued to decline. Banking contacts reported an   increase in deal discussion, although loan demand remained weak. Asset quality   improved and showed some signs of stabilizing at current low levels. In general,   contacts expected credit to ease going into 2010 for businesses and consumers.   However, several pointed out that lenders' balance sheets remain constrained and   capital preservation and loan loss provision continue to restrict the flow of   credit. Small businesses, in particular, still experienced very tight credit   markets. Deteriorating commercial real estate conditions were again a concern,   although a banking contact noted that they had some success in modifying loans   so that cost savings could be passed on to tenants. Liquidity in the secondary   mortgage market was also raised as a concern with the end of the Fed's agency   security purchase program nearing. Financial contacts were more inclined to be   pessimistic about the outlook for the beginning of 2010, pointing to the end of   stimulus measures as well as weak labor and housing markets.
Price pressures were mixed in September   and early October. Several contacts noted an increase in prices for materials   like steel and paper. Some increase in energy prices was also reported, although   a contact noted that very high levels of stored natural gas will likely lead to   lower heating costs this winter. Pass-through of cost pressures to downstream   prices was minimal, as contacts indicated pricing power remained limited. In   contrast, downward price pressures were reported in the construction and retail   industries as well as in food prices. Wage pressures were not significant, with   most firms holding current wage levels.
Harvesting the District's large corn and   soybean crop will take longer than normal due to delays from wet weather in   addition to the late maturity of the crops. Early reports indicated lower than   expected yields for corn and some issues with quality. Soybean yields were in   line with expectations for a record crop. With old supplies drawn down and new   supply slowed coming out of the fields, corn prices moved up throughout the   reporting period, benefitting those farmers who could deliver corn. In contrast,   soybean prices were lower in early October than at the start of September.   Livestock prices recovered some from summer lows, but were still well below the   levels of a year ago. Purchases by the U.S. Department of Agriculture provided   some support for hog prices. However, there were reports of unpaid feed bills   and bankruptcy negotiations for hog operations; and a contact indicated that   some nearly new hog facilities sat empty. Government payments helped smaller   dairy operators, but were a relatively minor factor for large dairy operations   that continued to operate underwater. The ethanol industry benefited from higher   sugar prices which reduced competition from substitutes for corn-based ethanol.
