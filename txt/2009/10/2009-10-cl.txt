The economy in the Fourth District has shown a few signs of improvement since   our last report, though overall activity is sluggish and the recovery remains   fragile. Reports from factories indicated that production was steady to up   slightly, with increases being attributed to new orders and seasonal   adjustments. New home sales showed a modest improvement, while commercial and   industrial construction continued at a slow pace. Credit availability remains a   major issue for residential and commercial contractors. Sales by District   retailers were flat to up slightly. New motor vehicle sales fell since the   "cash-for-clunkers" program ended, whereas purchases of used vehicles improved.   Coal production declined, with little change noted in oil and gas output.   Reports indicated an uptick in freight transport volume. Demand for new   commercial and industrial loans was soft, while consumer lending was flat to   down. Core deposits continued to grow substantially at most banks.
The only industries reporting notable employment reductions were commercial   construction and coal mining. Staffing firm representatives had mixed responses   when asked about the number of new job openings. However, a majority said that   they received more requests for temps rather than permanent employees. Given the   weak labor market, wage pressures are contained. We heard several reports of an   uptick in steel prices. Otherwise, raw materials and product pricing were   relatively stable. Business fixed investment remains at reduced levels, with   little change expected in the upcoming months.
A majority of our contacts said that they are in the process of further   reducing inventories or are not replenishing existing stocks. Capacity   utilization remains below historic norms, with little change noted over the past   six weeks. Capital expenditures continue to be substantially below pre-recession   levels, and only modest adjustments are expected in the upcoming months. Reports   show that other than an uptick in the cost of steel (especially stainless), raw   materials and product pricing was relatively stable. On net, there was little   change in staffing levels, and wage pressures are contained.
Commercial and industrial construction continues to be sluggish, though   activity in public works projects has picked up. All of our respondents said   that business has fallen on a year-over-year basis. Inquiries are coming in at a   much slower pace, while backlogs are down substantially for nearly all builders.   Most contacts expect construction activity will be weak in the upcoming months,   and it may be a year before a recovery begins. We continued to hear numerous   accounts of difficulties in obtaining financing for private-sector projects. For   the most part, construction materials prices were stable. A majority of our   contacts reported reducing the size of their workforce during the past six   weeks, while subcontractors are charging significantly lower rates.
