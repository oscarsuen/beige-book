The Tenth District economy expanded slightly in September and early October.   Retail spending increased somewhat, but auto sales dropped back sharply and   tourism activity slowed. Manufacturing activity showed gains, and further   improvements were expected in the months ahead. The residential real estate   sector exhibited signs of stabilization, while commercial real estate conditions   worsened. Bankers reported slight declines in loan demand and increases in   deposits; they expected loan quality to deteriorate in the coming months.   Activity in the energy sector expanded slightly since the previous survey but   was still down considerably from year-ago levels. The anticipation of an above   average harvest trimmed agricultural prices and farm income expectations.   Despite rising raw materials prices, consumer prices drifted down. District   employment conditions remained soft with almost no contacts reporting any wage   pressure.
