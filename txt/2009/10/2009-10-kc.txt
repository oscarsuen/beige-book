The Tenth District economy expanded slightly in September and early October.   Retail spending increased somewhat, but auto sales dropped back sharply and   tourism activity slowed. Manufacturing activity showed gains, and further   improvements were expected in the months ahead. The residential real estate   sector exhibited signs of stabilization, while commercial real estate conditions   worsened. Bankers reported slight declines in loan demand and increases in   deposits; they expected loan quality to deteriorate in the coming months.   Activity in the energy sector expanded slightly since the previous survey but   was still down considerably from year-ago levels. The anticipation of an above   average harvest trimmed agricultural prices and farm income expectations.   Despite rising raw materials prices, consumer prices drifted down. District   employment conditions remained soft with almost no contacts reporting any wage   pressure. Consumer Spending Consumer spending has been mixed since   the last survey period. Some retail contacts indicated increased sales in   September and early October. Retailers reported strong sales of cold weather   apparel and lower-priced goods but sluggish sales of jewelry and summer   merchandise. Retail sales were expected to increase further over the next three   months, but many contacts expected consumer demand to be weak relative to   pre-recession levels for some time. Restaurant sales and average check size   stabilized over the survey period, but most restaurant contacts continued to   report fewer sales compared with one year ago. Auto dealers reported a sharp   drop-off in sales after the end of the cash-for-clunkers program. Most auto   contacts reported that inventory levels were too low, especially for used cars.   Tourism spending declined, and almost all hotel contacts indicated that   occupancy rates remained below year-ago levels. Both tourism and hotel contacts   expected worsening conditions over the next three months. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Activity in the   District's manufacturing and high-tech sectors rose in September, while   transportation activity was flat. Manufacturers reported increases in   production, shipments, and new orders and expected further gains over the next   six months. Increased activity was noted for both durable and nondurable goods   production, but activity remained well below year-ago levels. Aircraft   manufacturing was an exception, with contacts reporting continued declines in   activity. The number of manufacturers expecting a gain in employment and average   employee workweek over the next six months increased since the previous survey.   However, manufacturers remained cautious about capital spending.   Technology-related firms indicated an uptick in sales and expected additional   gains in the near future. Since the last survey, contacts noted that   transportation activity had been flat but expected improvements over the next   three months. Real Estate and Construction The residential real estate   market showed signs of stabilizing, while commercial real estate conditions   deteriorated. Sales of lower-priced homes continued to increase over the past   month, while demand for luxury properties remained sluggish. Most real estate   contacts reported that home sales were higher than year-ago levels amid still   falling home prices. However, respondents expected some decrease in activity   over the next few months due to seasonal factors and the expiration of the first   time homebuyer tax credit. Builders reported some stabilization in housing   starts, but levels remained well below one year ago and were not expected to   improve over the next three months. The deterioration in commercial real estate   activity continued in September and early October and is expected to worsen in   the coming months. Vacancy rates rose slightly, and absorption rates fell   sharply leading to lower rents. Commercial construction activity declined and   sales slowed resulting in lower prices. Developers continued to report   difficulty obtaining credit. Banking Bankers reported moderately weaker loan demand,   further increases in deposits, and a continued negative outlook for loan   quality. Overall loan demand continued to decline, but at a somewhat slower rate   than in the previous survey. Demand fell further for commercial real estate   loans. However, demand for commercial and industrial loans held steady following   a long string of declines since early last year. Demand for consumer installment   loans was also unchanged, and demand for residential real estate loans resumed   increasing after a dip in the last survey. Some banks continued to tighten   credit standards on commercial real estate loans, but credit standards for other   loan categories were generally unchanged. Loan quality remained substantially   lower than a year ago, and about half of respondents expected loan quality to   decline further over the next six months. Deposits rose further, with most   categories sharing in the increase. Among factors cited for the increase were a   continued flight to quality, a desire by investors to park their cash on the   sidelines, and an easing in rate competition from troubled institutions. Energy Energy activity edged up in September and early   October but remained considerably below year-ago levels. Overall drilling   activity improved slightly over the previous month, mainly among crude oil   producers, and activity was expected to remain stable. However, rig counts were   still at low levels historically, particularly for natural gas in Colorado and   Oklahoma. Natural gas prices remained subdued due to record supplies in storage.   However, many producers expected price increases in the coming cold winter   months. Agriculture Since the last survey period, the prospects   of a bumper crop limited agricultural commodity prices and pushed down farm   income expectations. The majority of the corn and soybean crops were reported in   good or better condition. Farmers anticipated above average yields, although   delayed spring planting has set back the harvest. Winter wheat planting was   progressing well. Weak livestock demand limited profits for hog and cattle   operators. With weaker crop and livestock incomes, District bankers reported   stronger demand for operating loans and lower farm loan repayment rates.   However, farmland values held near year-ago levels as contacts noted stronger   non-farmer investor demand and fewer farms being offered for sale. Wages and Prices Consumer prices generally decreased, and   labor market conditions remained weak. Manufacturers reported rising prices for   raw materials and expected additional increases over the next few months.   However, these costs were still below year-ago levels and were not expected to   be passed along to customers in the form of higher prices for finished goods.   Retailers continued to report price decreases and expected additional declines   in the coming months. Restaurant contacts noted a decline in food prices. The   majority of firms did not expect to increase employment over the next few   months, and almost no contacts reported any wage pressure.
