Economic activity in the Fourth District weakened somewhat since mid-April. Reports from factories show an appreciable decline in production and new orders. Residential construction remains weak, while commercial and industrial building decreased. Commercial and residential builders reported that project financing is very difficult to obtain. On balance, sales by District retailers were stable. New motor vehicle sales slowed, while purchases of used vehicles showed a modest improvement. Coal production fell substantially, with little change noted in oil and gas output. Freight transport volume remains at low levels. Refinancing applications for residential mortgages remain very strong, though other types of consumer lending were characterized as stable. Commercial and industrial lending activity is mixed. Core deposits grew strongly.
Employment declines were seen in manufacturing, commercial construction, and energy. Staffing firms reported a falloff in job openings. Given the weak labor market, wage pressures are contained. For the most part, input and product prices were stable or declining. Capital spending has been frozen or trimmed back to mainly critical maintenance projects.
Most of our contacts reported that their capital budgets are frozen or have been cut back significantly. Some manufacturers told us that they are limiting expenditures to critical maintenance projects. Capital spending is expected to stay at depressed levels until the economy turns around. For the most part, raw materials prices and product pricing were stable or declined, and little inflationary pressure is expected during the next 12 months. A majority of our respondents made further reductions in payroll costs through layoffs, wage cuts, and reductions in production hours. Predictably, wage pressures are contained.
Reports on nonresidential construction activity were mixed, but leaned toward the downside. Builders involved in public works projects were more positive in their outlook than those in commercial and industrial development. In general, backlogs and inquiries are down significantly on a year-over-year basis. We heard numerous reports of difficulties in obtaining financing that resulted in some projects being delayed or shut down. Looking forward, most commercial builders do not see conditions improving during the next few months. Construction materials prices are stable to declining, while subcontractors are readily available at very competitive rates. A few general contractors reduced their workforce since our last report.
