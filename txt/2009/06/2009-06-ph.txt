Economic activity in the Third District continued at a slow rate in May. Manufacturers, on balance, reported declines in shipments and new orders. Retailers gave mixed reports, noting gains in sales during the month at discount stores but weakening sales at stores selling higher-priced merchandise. Motor vehicle dealers indicated that sales remained sluggish. Bank loan volume has been level in recent weeks, and credit quality has continued to deteriorate. Residential real estate sales showed a slight seasonal gain in May but remained below the level of a year ago. Nonresidential real estate investment and construction activity continued to be slow. Service-sector activity has been generally slow in recent weeks. Business firms in the region reported level or falling input costs and output prices in May.
The outlook in the Third District improved slightly in May. Although contacts do not foresee substantial increases in activity in the near term, more now believe the decline in economic activity might be near a bottom. Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers expect sales to gain strength slowly, but auto dealers expect sales to remain slow for the rest of the year. Bankers anticipate little growth in lending. Residential real estate agents and home builders believe market conditions might be stabilizing, but they do not expect sales to move up solidly until next year. Contacts in nonresidential real estate expect leasing and purchase activity to remain weak during the balance of the year but perhaps move up somewhat during the fourth quarter. Service-sector firms expect activity to be slow during the next few months, at least.
The outlook among Third District manufacturers is positive despite the current weakness, and the level of optimism has improved since the last Beige Book. Among firms polled in May, around one-half expect new orders and shipments to increase during the next six months and around one-tenth expect decreases. However, most of the manufacturers surveyed in May expect recovery to be slow and uneven. Typical comments are "the business outlook is very uncertain," and "sales improvement will be small."
Third District auto dealers reported that sales remained very sluggish in May. Dealers said demand for motor vehicles continued to be hampered by weak economic conditions, limits on the availability of financing for vehicle purchases, and consumers' concern about the future of domestic automobile manufacturers. Dealers expect sales to remain slow for the rest of the year, and they expect closings and consolidation among dealerships to increase during the balance of this year and into next year.
Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that construction, leasing, and purchase activity remained low in April and May. Vacancy rates in office and industrial buildings have been rising. Economic uncertainty has prompted "short-term transactions, downsizing, and consolidation of existing spaces," according to one contact. Rental rates have been easing, with greater declines in Class B than Class A buildings, according to leasing agents. Contacts expect nonresidential real estate leasing and construction activity to remain weak through the rest of the year, but some believe that lack of new construction could result in a tightening in the market by the end of the year.
