Economic activity in the Eighth District remained weak, but the pace of decline has moderated since our previous report.  Both manufacturing and services activity contracted at a slower pace.  Retail and auto sales in July and the first part of August were down from a year ago.  Residential and commercial real estate markets conditions continue to be weak.  Overall lending activity at a sample of large District banks decreased moderately in the three-month period ending in July.
Car dealers in the District reported that, compared with last year, sales in July and the first part of August were down slightly, on average.  One-third of the car dealers surveyed reported large decreases in sales, one-third reported increases in sales (mostly attributed to the cash-for-clunkers program), and the remaining one-third reported no change in sales.  About 37 percent of the car dealers noted that new car sales had increased relative to used car sales, while 25 percent reported the opposite.  Also, 33 percent reported an increase in low-end vehicle sales relative to high-end vehicle sales, while 8 percent reported the opposite.  About 46 percent reported more rejections of finance applications, but 12 percent reported more acceptances.  Two-thirds of the car dealers surveyed reported that their inventories were too low, while 12 percent reported that their inventories were too high.  About 46 percent of the car dealers expect sales for September and October to increase over 2008 levels, 37 percent expect sales to decrease, and the remaining 17 percent expect sales to be unchanged.
The District's service sector continued to decline in most areas, but at a slower pace.  Contacts in business support services and social services reported plans to close facilities and lay off workers.  In contrast, government service jobs continued to be added because of the fiscal stimulus plan.
Conditions in the commercial and industrial real estate markets were mixed throughout the District.  Compared with the first quarter of 2009, second-quarter 2009 industrial vacancy rates increased in Little Rock, Louisville, and Memphis and decreased in St. Louis.  During the same period, suburban office vacancy rates increased in Little Rock and Louisville and decreased in Memphis and St. Louis.  Downtown office vacancy rates remained fairly constant in St. Louis, increased in Louisville and Memphis, and decreased in Little Rock.  Commercial and industrial construction markets continued to decline.  One contact in Memphis reported that new commercial construction is minimal.  A contact in Louisville does not expect nonresidential construction to improve until 2011.
