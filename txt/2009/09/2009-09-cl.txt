The economy in the Fourth District has shown a slight improvement since our last report, though activity remains sluggish.  Reports from factories indicated that production was flat to up slightly, with increases being attributed to new orders.  New home construction remains weak, while nonresidential building activity was mixed.  Credit availability continues to be an issue for residential and commercial contractors.  Sales by District retailers were steady to down slightly.  New motor vehicle sales received a substantial boost from the cash-for-clunkers program, whereas purchases of used vehicles slowed.  Coal production fell, with little change noted in oil and gas output.  Freight transport volume remains at low levels.  Commercial and industrial loan activity was stable to declining.  Consumer lending was generally characterized as soft, with indirect auto lending as the only bright spot in the consumer portfolio.  Core deposits increased across the District.
Only modest employment declines were reported in commercial construction, banking, and coal mining.  Reports from staffing firms showed that job openings were flat to up slightly.  Given the weak labor market, wage pressures are contained.  Increased prices for metals and lumber have moderated somewhat since our last report.  Capital spending remains at low levels and little change is expected in the upcoming months.
Although capacity utilization remains below historic norms, several manufacturers noted improved utilization rates since our last report.  In general, capital spending remains at low levels and little change is expected in the upcoming months.  Reports show that increases in raw material prices (especially for metals) were beginning to moderate, though some upward pressure on product pricing continues.  There were only minimal reports of further cuts in payroll costs through layoffs, wage reductions, and curtailments in work hours.  Wage pressures are contained.
Reports on nonresidential construction were mixed, with some improvement seen by contractors participating in public works projects.  Activity in private commercial and industrial building was characterized as slow due to declining inquiries and backlogs.  All of our respondents said that business has fallen on a year-over-year basis.  Looking forward, most contacts expect construction activity will be very weak during 2010.  We continued to hear numerous accounts of difficulties in obtaining financing for private-sector projects.  On balance, little change in construction materials prices was noted.  A few general contractors reported laying off employees, while subcontractors are readily available.
