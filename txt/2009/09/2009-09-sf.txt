Economic activity in the Twelfth District showed continued scattered signs of firming but appeared to be little changed on net during the reporting period of late July through the end of August.  Upward price pressures remained quite modest overall, and upward wage pressures were largely absent.  Retail sales in general stayed anemic, while demand for services continued to erode.  District manufacturing activity remained stuck at very low levels, although conditions improved further for manufacturers of information technology products.  Demand was solid for agricultural producers but remained weak for providers of natural resource products.  Home sales strengthened further in most areas, but demand for commercial real estate continued to weaken.  Banking contacts reported that District lending activity eased on net and credit quality continued to deteriorate.
Little or no upward pressure on wages was reported.  Hiring remained quite restricted, and high levels of unemployment held down wage pressures throughout the District.  Contacts noted that, despite an anticipated improvement in economic conditions, they expect hiring to remain subdued for a prolonged period as companies focus on maintaining recent productivity improvements rather than expanding employment; accordingly, they expect upward wage pressures to remain muted for some time.
Demand for services eased further since the last reporting period.  Contacts in the restaurant and food services industry noted weak demand and further declines in revenues.  Providers of health-care services reported a small drop in patient volumes, reversing the slight uptick in the prior period.    Demand weakened further for providers of professional services such as business consulting and also for transportation services, although the pace of decline has reportedly moderated.  Travel activity in the District was mixed:  it fell further at major destination markets in California and Nevada, but contacts in Hawaii reported a slight increase in visitor arrivals and hotel occupancy rates from prior low levels.
