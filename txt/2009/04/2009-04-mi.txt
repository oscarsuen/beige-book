The Ninth District economy contracted further since the last report. Activity dropped in consumer spending, tourism, services, construction and real estate, manufacturing, energy and mining. However, agricultural conditions improved. Employment continued to decline. Wage increases were modest, with some pay freezes reported. Prices were generally level during the reporting period, as some price decreases continued to moderate.
A representative of an auto dealers association in Minnesota noted that car sales saw a seasonal bounce this spring; nevertheless, sales at many dealerships were more than 30 percent lower than last year.
Tourism was down slightly compared with a year ago. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, lodging tax receipts during the winter season were down more than 10 percent from a year earlier, according to an official. In contrast, a Minnesota-based travel agency said that sales for leisure travel were up 5 percent in early 2009 compared with a year ago; however, corporate travel dropped from last year, as some companies have placed a freeze on travel.
Commercial real estate market conditions were stagnant. A contact at a Minneapolis commercial real estate firm said potential tenants are holding off on leasing decisions due to uncertainty about future conditions. Residential real estate markets were mixed. Recent weeks have seen increases in home sales in Minneapolis-St. Paul from last year's lows; however, sale prices remain lower. A real estate agent in Fargo, N.D., said market conditions there were stable, though late-March flooding put activity on hold. The market for high-end homes in the Flathead Valley area of Montana has fallen sharply, shown by a record high level of inventory and declining prices.
In contrast, a local economic development official in Rochester, Minn., noted that the area's large health care sector remained relatively solid, which has helped keep the area's unemployment rate lower than the state's. In addition, a sawmill recently restarted in Montana, reinstating almost all of the mill's 130 employees.
Wage increases were modest, with some pay freezes reported. A union that represents faculty at Minnesota's community and technical colleges recently tentatively agreed to a two-year salary freeze. A Minneapolis area health care provider announced a wage freeze for most of its noncontract employees. According to respondents to a recent St. Cloud (Minn.) Area Business Outlook Survey, 21 percent expect to increase employee compensation over the next six months, while 6 percent expect to decrease compensation; last year 37 percent expected increases, while 2 percent expected decreases.
Prices were generally level during the reporting period, as some price decreases continued to moderate since the last report. Minnesota gasoline prices at the end of March inched up about 10 cents a gallon since mid-February, but were $1.14 less than a year ago. Lumber prices continued to decrease since the last report and were almost 10 percent lower than a year ago. A number of copper, steel and aluminum product prices continued to decline slightly. In addition, fertilizer prices softened since the last report.
