Reports on retail sales across the District were mixed. Auto dealers reported a decline in sales and a few dealerships have closed their doors. Home sales and residential construction continue to be weak throughout the District. Reports from commercial and industrial real estate contacts indicated a continued slowdown in economic activity. Overall lending at a sample of small and mid-sized banks increased slightly during the first quarter of 2009.
The District's service sector also has continued to decline in most industries since our previous report. Firms in information and medical services reduced their payrolls. A firm in warehousing and transportation services and a large national retailer closed their operations. In contrast, a contact in the financial services industry and a few firms in the business support services industry reported plans to expand their operations and hire additional workers. Reports on retail sales across the District remain mixed, with an equal number of contacts expressing optimism for the future as other contacts expressed concerns over low traffic volume. Auto dealers generally reported a decline in sales, with a few dealerships closing their doors. One contact expressed concern that showroom traffic is up, but that it is difficult for buyers to qualify for financing.
Commercial real estate and construction markets are declining throughout the District. One contact in Memphis described commercial real estate conditions as very poor. A large construction company in southern Indiana reported that business has slowed considerably. Industrial real estate and construction contacts reported a challenging economic environment. One contact in St. Louis noted that demand for industrial real estate is waning and that the market is currently overbuilt. A contact in Memphis noted a decline in demand for industrial distribution space and did not expect to see any new construction in the industrial market until mid-2010. In contrast, a contact in south-central Kentucky reported that commercial building permits are stable as a result of several projects in downtown Bowling Green and at Western Kentucky University.
