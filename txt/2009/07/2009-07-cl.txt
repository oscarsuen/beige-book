The economy in the Fourth District has shown signs of stabilizing since our last report, though activity remains sluggish.  Reports from factories indicated that production stabilized at low levels, with manufacturers expecting little change in demand during the upcoming months.  New home construction remains weak, while non-residential building activity was mixed.  Credit availability continues to be an issue for residential and commercial contractors.  Sales by District retailers were flat to slightly down.  New motor vehicle sales remained weak, whereas purchases of used vehicles were relatively strong.  Coal production fell, with little change noted in oil and gas output.  Freight transport volume remains at low levels.  Commercial and industrial loan activity was mixed.  Refinancing applications for residential mortgages have slowed, though other types of consumer lending were generally characterized as stable.  Core deposits increased across the District.
Employment declines were reported in manufacturing, regional banking, and coal mining.  Staffing firms noted a fall-off in job openings, with the exception of healthcare and call centers.  Given the weak labor market, wage pressures are contained.  We heard widespread reports of increased prices for metals and residential construction materials.  Capital spending was frozen or trimmed back to mainly critical maintenance projects.
Capacity utilization has changed little since our last report, with most contacts saying that it is well below historic norms.  Capital budgets remain frozen or have been severely curtailed.  Capital expenditures are expected to stay at depressed levels through the remainder of 2009.  We heard widespread reports of an uptick in metals prices, which is putting some upward pressure on product pricing.  A majority of our respondents made further reductions in payroll costs through layoffs, wage cuts, and reductions in production hours.  Predictably, wage pressures are contained.
Reports on nonresidential construction activity were mixed, with some improvement seen by contractors participating in public works and education projects.  We heard several reports of a slight pickup in backlogs and inquiries.  All of our respondents said that business has dropped below its level a year ago.  Looking forward to 2010, half of our contacts expect construction activity will be very weak.  Although a few contractors anticipate some growth next year, they do not expect a return to 2008 levels.  We continued to hear numerous accounts of difficulties in obtaining financing for private-sector projects.  Any increases cited in construction materials prices were attributed to seasonal factors and the recent run-up in oil prices.  Apart from seasonal help, only two general contractors noted that they have hired a few workers due to increased project work.  Subcontractors are readily available at very competitive rates.
