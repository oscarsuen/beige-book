Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to hold largely steady on net during the reporting period of June through mid-July, with continued signs of stabilization or improvement in some sectors.  Upward price pressures remained very modest on net, and upward wage pressures generally were absent.  Retail sales remained sluggish, while demand for services weakened further.  Manufacturing activity in the District stayed mired at very low levels on balance, although demand and activity improved further for manufacturers of information technology products.  Sales continued at a solid pace for agricultural producers, while demand fell further for providers of natural resource products.  Housing sales and construction picked up in some areas but were weak on net, and demand for commercial real estate continued to fall.  Banking contacts reported very weak loan demand and ongoing declines in credit quality.
Upward wage pressures remained virtually nonexistent.  Contacts continued to report the use of wage freezes or cuts, reductions in benefits, and mandatory furloughs as cost-saving measures in various industries.  Hiring remained quite limited, and reports pointed to rising reliance on temporary workers in some sectors, putting additional downward pressure on wages.
Demand for services continued to soften on net since the last reporting period.  Conditions remained challenging for restaurants throughout the District, with contacts noting significant revenue declines and further closures.  Likewise, demand for professional and media services continued to be very weak, resulting in additional layoffs.  Demand for transportation services dropped, with reports pointing to further declines in container traffic at ports.  Travel and tourism activity in the District fell further; the sharpest declines were evident in the business and luxury segments of the market, which reduced airline traffic.  By contrast, providers of health-care services saw a slight increase in patient volumes, reversing the trend of prior reporting periods.
