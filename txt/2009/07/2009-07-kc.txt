The Tenth District economy showed further signs of stabilization in June.  Consumer spending was generally sluggish but improvements were noted in auto sales and tourism spending.  Manufacturing activity expanded modestly, primarily in nondurable goods production.  Residential real estate activity held steady; however, commercial real estate firms reported weakening market conditions.  Employment in the energy sector continued to contract in response to low natural gas prices.  Bankers reported weaker loan demand, stable deposits, and a continued negative outlook for loan quality.  While growing conditions improved, agricultural profit opportunities softened, especially for livestock producers.  Despite higher input prices, retail price pressures eased and little evidence of wage pressures was reported in District labor markets.
