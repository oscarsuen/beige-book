The pace of decline of economic activity in the Eighth District has moderated since our previous report.  Activity in the manufacturing and services sectors contracted at a slower pace.  Reports from retailers and auto dealers were mixed.  Residential and commercial real estate markets conditions continued to be weak.  Total loans at a sample of small and midsized District banks declined slightly from early April to mid-June.
The District's services sector continued to decline in most areas but a slower pace.  A large number of contacts in education services, information services, business support services, and medical services announced job cuts.  In contrast, contacts in the government services and health/social services industries announced plans to hire additional workers.  Also, several cities in the District continued to report that they will be hiring temporary and part-time summer workers in a range of service industries using funds allocated through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  Contacts in the retail sector reported a mixed outlook.  Smaller retailers responded to a slowdown in store traffic with a mixture of promotions and discounted merchandise.  In contrast, a major big-box retailer in the District continued to experience growth, particularly by targeting higher-income consumers.  Auto dealers' reports were mixed; several franchise owners are going out of business, converting to used-car dealerships, or transitioning into service/repair centers.  Contacts reported that smaller cars continue to sell well with a limited market for large trucks and sport utility vehicles.
Commercial real estate and construction markets continued to struggle throughout the District.  A contact in Memphis noted that commercial real estate foreclosures are likely to increase as a result of current credit conditions.  A contact in St. Louis noted that, with the exception of institutional and health care-related projects, little construction is taking place.  Industrial real estate and construction contacts throughout the District also continued to report a difficult environment.  Contacts in the Louisville area expressed disappointment regarding the slow impact of the stimulus bill and the size of projects it has funded to date.
