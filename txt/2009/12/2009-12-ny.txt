The Second District's economy has shown further signs of improvement since   the last report, though the labor market remains soft. There are no indications   of any significant price pressures. Manufacturing sector contacts report steady   to increasing activity and continued improvement in general business conditions,   and a large majority remain optimistic about the near-term outlook. Auto dealers   report a rebound in sales in recent weeks. General merchandise retailers also   say that sales have improved since the last report. There are signs of a pickup   in tourism activity in New York City.
Consumer confidence measures declined modestly in October: residents of the   Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, Pa), hold an increasingly negative view on   current conditions, and have recently become a bit less optimistic in their   near-term expectations. Similarly, Siena College reports that consumer   confidence among New York State residents edged down in both September and   October, after reaching its highest level in more than a year in August.
Tourism activity in New York City has picked up since the last report;   leisure travel has been increasingly brisk, even as business travel remains   sluggish. Manhattan hotels report that occupancy rates exceeded year-earlier   levels in both September and October, for the first time in more than a year,   though this was mostly attributed to the unusually low levels of the latter part   of 2008. More notably, room rates climbed by substantially more than the   seasonal norm in September and October, though they are still down 15-20 percent   from last year. Bookings for more than a month ahead remain sluggish as visitors   seem reluctant to commit in this uncertain environment. Broadway theaters report   a pronounced pickup in attendance, as well as revenue, in recent weeks; these   measures, respectively, are up roughly 14 and 20 percent from a year ago--a good   deal more than in September.
Housing markets have been mixed but, on balance,   a bit softer since the last report. Home sales and prices have reportedly   weakened moderately in the Buffalo area, in part due to the impending expiration   of the [now extended] homebuyer tax credit. Contacts in northern New Jersey   report that resale transactions remain low but have picked up a bit, and that   selling prices appear to have stabilized at low levels. However, builders have   reportedly stepped back on new development as they remain skittish about having   excess inventory. New York City's housing market has continued to weaken: while   sales activity for existing apartments has rebounded from depressed levels,   sales of new units remain very sluggish. Selling prices for existing units are   reported to be down roughly 25 percent from a year earlier, with even steeper   declines at the high end of the market; weakness at the high end is also evident   in northern New Jersey. Developers looking to unload large inventories have   begun to auction off condo units with steep discounts--primarily in Brooklyn,   but also in the Bronx. New York City's rental market also continues to weaken,   with contract rents in Manhattan falling roughly 10 percent over the past 12   months; moreover, when concessions are factored in, the decline in effective   rents has been a good deal steeper. On the supply side, one industry expert   estimates that nearly 3,000 new rental units have been completed in Manhattan   thus far in 2009--roughly double the figure for all of 2008.
Looking at business activity more generally, manufacturing firms in the   District report continued growth in business activity in October and early   November, and most contacts anticipate further improvement in the months ahead.   Non-manufacturing firms indicate that business is generally steady to rising   moderately, but they too are fairly optimistic about the near-term outlook. In   general, contacts report only modest input price pressures and are holding their   own selling prices steady.
