Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based   on information collected on or before November 20, 2009. This document   summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the   Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve   officials.
Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic   conditions have generally improved modestly since the last report. Eight   Districts indicated some pickup in activity or improvement in conditions, while   the remaining four--Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta--reported   that conditions were little changed and/or mixed.
Consumer spending was reported to have picked up moderately since the last   report, for both general merchandise and vehicles; a number of Districts noted   relatively robust sales of used autos. Most Districts indicated that non-auto   retailers were holding lean inventories going into the holiday season. Tourism   activity varied across Districts. Manufacturing conditions were said to be, on   balance, steady to moderately improving across most of the country, while   conditions in the nonfinancial service sector generally strengthened somewhat,   though with some variation across Districts and across industries. Residential   real estate conditions were somewhat improved from very low levels, on balance,   led by the lower end of the market. Most Districts reported some pickup in home   sales, though prices were generally said to be flat or declining modestly;   residential construction was characterized as weak, but some Districts did note   some pickup in activity. Commercial real estate markets and construction   activity were depicted as very weak and, in many cases, deteriorating.
Financial institutions generally reported steady to weaker loan demand,   continued tight credit standards, and steady or deteriorating loan quality. In   the agricultural sector, the fall harvest was delayed in the eastern half of the   nation due to excessively wet conditions during October and early November. Most   energy-producing Districts noted a slight uptick in activity in the sector since   the last report. Labor market conditions remained weak since the last report,   though there were signs of stabilization and scattered signs of improvement.   While some Districts reported upward pressure on commodity prices, they saw   little or no indication of upward wage pressures or of any significant increase   in prices of finished goods.
Most Districts also noted that retailers were holding leaner inventories this   holiday season, though some indicate that retailers have recently become more   optimistic about the holiday-season outlook. Auto dealers' inventories, largely   depleted during the cash-for-clunkers program, have been or are being   rebuilt.
Tourism was mixed across those Districts reporting. Travel and   tourism--especially leisure travel--was described as robust or improved in the   New York, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Atlanta and Kansas City   characterized tourism as sluggish, while Richmond and Minneapolis described it   as mixed; Richmond noted that tourism has been adversely affected by severe and   damaging coastal storms, while Kansas City characterized the outlook as "grim."   New York indicated that business travel remained sluggish, but Minneapolis and   Dallas note a slight pickup.
Many Districts reported that their contacts were optimistic about the   near-term outlook. Manufacturers in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta,   Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts expected business conditions to improve   in the coming months, while producers in the Cleveland District expressed   uncertainty about near-term conditions. The outlook in the Dallas District was   mixed, with most manufacturers expressing cautious optimism about the near term   and construction-related manufacturers expressing pessimism about the future   largely due to expectations of prolonged weakness in commercial real estate.
Despite the firming in sales, the level of new residential construction   activity was generally characterized as weak, though recent trends have been   mixed--Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas noted some pickup in home construction,   whereas the Chicago and St. Louis Districts reported declines. Residential   construction was described as flat or stabilizing by Cleveland, Minneapolis, and   San Francisco.
Commercial real estate conditions were widely characterized as weak and, in   many cases, deteriorating further. Market conditions were reported to have   weakened in virtually all Districts, with rising vacancy rates, downward   pressure on rents, and little, if any, new development. Expectations for 2010   were also quite low. Boston characterized the commercial real estate outlook as   "bleak," Dallas noted that construction was at "historically low levels," and   Kansas City described the sector as "distressed." Still, some Districts noted   scattered signs of encouragement: Cleveland and Chicago referenced public-works   projects as a source of increased business, Richmond noted signs of increased   leasing activity from the health and education sectors, Atlanta indicated a   modest pickup in new development projects, Minneapolis noted some recently   started hotel and retail development, and San Francisco cited slight improvement   in availability of financing for new development.
Most energy-producing Districts reported a slight uptick in activity in   extraction industries since the last report. Contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta,   Dallas, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts noted steady to   increasing oil and natural gas production within their regions, albeit from low   levels of production observed earlier this year. Contacts in the Cleveland   District also reported that a sharp decline in coal production had leveled out   since the last report. In general, oil prices increased somewhat, while reports   on the price of natural gas were mixed due in large part to differences in   inventory levels across Districts. Mining activity in the Minneapolis District   increased.
Districts generally reported little or no upward wage pressures, while some   Districts noted upward pressure in commodity prices, and most Districts reported   stable selling prices. Wages were largely reported to be holding steady in the   Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San   Francisco Districts. Most Districts reported stable prices overall, although   some reported higher input prices, largely for energy and other commodities used   in production, with a limited ability to raise selling prices. Prices were   reported as moderately lower in the Kansas City District, and downward price   pressures were cited for some professional services and intermodal   transportation firms in the Dallas District. Some makers of food products and   chemicals in the Philadelphia District reported raising prices, and the prices   of computer memory chips continued to firm in the San Francisco District.   Retailers in several Districts indicated that they have managed inventory levels   in an effort to prevent the steep price discounting that occurred last year,   however, some promotional price discounting is expected through the holiday   season.
