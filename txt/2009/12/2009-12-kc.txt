The Tenth District economy continued to expand modestly in October and early   November. Retail sales increased and were expected rise further, but the travel   and tourism sector remained weak. Manufacturing activity also grew moderately,   with production, new orders, and exports rising since the last survey period.   Residential real estate recovered further, while the commercial real estate   market continued to deteriorate. Energy activity rose slightly, as higher prices   boosted exploration for crude oil in particular. The agricultural outlook also   improved with higher commodity prices. On the other hand, District bankers   reported that loan demand weakened and loan quality declined. Contacts reported   that prices of finished goods and services declined modestly, and no evidence of   wage pressures was reported.
