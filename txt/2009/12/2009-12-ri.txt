The Fifth District economy, on balance, was more mixed than in our last   assessment, with housing, retail, and banking activity marginally increasing and   most other sectors little changed or contracting. An uptick in retail sales   activity was reported, even though most big-ticket sales (with the exception of   new and used vehicles) were still down. Service sector revenue declines were   less widespread. Manufacturing activity, which was increasing in our last two   reports, stalled over the last month, with several contacts concerned that tight   credit was limiting the ability of their customers to place orders. Financial   sector contacts reported little change in overall lending, but noted some   increases in both consumer and small business lending activity. The residential   real estate sector continued to benefit from tax credits for home buyers.   Commercial real estate saw an increase in business downsizing activity, but that   was offset by weakness in other segments of that market. Finally, recent severe   weather disrupted tourism, causing widespread hotel cancellations along the   Atlantic coast. Flooding also damaged crops and delayed planting. While prices   were flat or declining in most sectors, manufacturers noted some increases in   commodity based prices. Retail Sales ticked up in recent weeks, according to most   District retailers. Although big-ticket sales were down overall, new and used   vehicle sales edged up, particularly for foreign nameplates. One automobile   dealer described the change in his sales as "trickles of improvement," and most   dealers indicated that their inventory was too low because factory production   was down. Store managers at discount department stores also reported that sales   had picked up slightly--especially sales of toys and electronics--although   customer traffic was generally flat. A majority of retailers indicated that they   hired their standard number of seasonal employees or were adding hours for   current employees. District merchants reported that their inventory levels were   about right for expected holiday sales of two percent above a year ago.   Merchants anticipated flat sales of gift cards; one store manager expected   redemption of gift cards to occur earlier than usual because of the economy. The   pace of job cuts generally slowed and average retail wages were little changed,   while retail prices edged higher. Services Contacts at services firms reported that revenue   contraction was less widespread in recent weeks. An executive at a freight   trucking establishment said, "We're seeing some green sprigs out there; we just   don't know yet if it's grass or weeds." Demand for healthcare services remained   strong, despite a decline in the number of flu cases being treated. A contact at   a financial services firm remarked that his clients were "feeling better but   there remains an underlying wariness about the markets." Contacts in the   professional, scientific, and technical services sector gave mixed reports on   revenues, while sources at administrative and support services firms indicated   that revenues were either unchanged or down. Employment, average wage growth,   and price change were virtually flat, according to contacts. Manufacturing District manufacturing activity flattened   in October and the first half of November. Contacts reported that shipments and   new orders grew more slowly since our last report, and employment indicators   returned to negative territory after being positive for the last two months.   Several contacts noted that their customers were having difficulty obtaining   credit. A furniture manufacturer reported that his retail customers continued to   have credit problems, which was a major concern for his company. Similarly, a   textile mill producer said that he had not yet seen reorders from retailers and   that credit was very tight for his customers, and a manufacturer noted that his   customers could not get financing for wind turbine projects. A producer of   machinery indicated that he was starting to see material-based price increases   (such as in steel- and petroleum-based goods), while a producer of automobile   upholstery said that the increase in demand for automotive parts had consumed   much of the excess capacity for raw material production. A door manufacturer   observed that competitors continued to fight over any piece of business,   resulting in an inability to raise prices to cover higher material costs.   Accordingly, contacts reported that prices paid increased at a quicker pace,   while finished goods prices changed little. Finance Lending activity in the Fifth District was   virtually unchanged from our last report, with the residential sector still   providing most of the positive news. However, there was also a smattering of   encouraging reports from the consumer and commercial sectors. Residential   lending continued to be bolstered largely by first-time homebuyers seeking tax   credits, with gains often limited to the low end of the housing market. One   banker also noted an increase in home equity loan use over the last several   months and another reported some improvement in consumer loan delinquencies. A   major regional bank reported an uptick in small business loan demand, mostly for   financing inventory, but also for a limited amount of plant and equipment   spending. Loan demand from large businesses, however, remained mostly stable.   Finally, most banks reported no change in credit standards, while a few cited   modest tightening. Real Estate Real estate agents across much of the   District reported further improvements in house sales in recent weeks, and most   cited the government's tax credit program as the driving force. A Virginia agent   reported very good sales and expected this trend to continue as a result of the   extension and expansion of the tax credit program. Likewise, agents in North and   South Carolina reported year-over-year sales increases. In contrast, a Richmond   Realtor reported a significant drop in house sales, due to the concern that loan   approvals would not be completed before the government's tax credit program was   expected to expire on November 1. House prices generally continued to decline   since our last report. Houses priced in the lower bracket remained the best   sellers across much of the District. However, at least one Realtor in Asheville,   North Carolina reported middle- and higher-priced houses as among the best   sellers in his market. Fifth District contacts reported that demand for commercial real estate   remained depressed over the last month. Several agents noted that inquiries from   potential clients often "burn out" quickly due to a lack of confidence in the   economy. However, few contacts were seeing conditions actually getting worse   since our last assessment, and scattered reports of modest increases in leasing   activity were noted. Most of such improvement, however, was limited to   downsizing of office and retail space, as lower rental prices and weakness in   demand motivated tenants to relocate. Vacancy rates remained high throughout the   District and were still rising, but several real estate agents noted some   reductions in areas dominated by health and education services. Tourism Tourist activity was mixed since our last report,   mostly due to severe weather effects in recent weeks. Heavy storms battered   coastal areas along the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Virginia during the   second week of November, causing damage to some coastal hotels and widespread   cancellations of hotel reservations. A contact from the Outer Banks said that a   string of approximately 10 oceanfront houses partially collapsed after being   pummeled by the surging ocean. Tropical Storm Ida swept away most of the major   north-south road on Hatteras Island, which is now accessible only by four-wheel   drive vehicles. Bookings on the Outer Banks were expected to be "pretty weak"   for the week of the Thanksgiving holiday, as clean-up will require considerable   time. In contrast, a manager at a ski resort in Virginia reported that bookings   for the Thanksgiving holiday were somewhat stronger than a year ago, and that   the recent abundance of rainfall would enhance snowmaking capabilities in early   December. Temporary Employment Fifth District employment agents   reported generally stronger demand for temporary workers in recent weeks. Much   of the improvement was based on the anticipation of increased sales over the   holidays. In contrast, one contact stated that diminishing company and local   government budgets and slower retail demand for merchandise for the upcoming   holidays were expected to cause weaker demand for temporary workers. Skills in   greatest demand were IT, distribution center workers, sales and office support,   and nurses aides/assistants. Agriculture Remnants of Tropical Storm Ida coupled with a   November "nor'easter" brought heavy rain, strong winds, and flooding over the   eastern half of the District. With the exception of West Virginia, fieldwork   came to a halt as excessively wet conditions delayed harvest progress in most   areas of the District and caused varying degrees of crop damage. In Maryland and   North Carolina, wet weather hampered soybean harvesting and wheat planting,   while cotton, soybean, and peanut growers in South Carolina expressed concern   about quality. In the Virginia Beach area, flooded rivers, ditches, and   low-lying fields meant that many recently planted wheat fields needed to be   replanted. Virginia health officials closed fishing in all Chesapeake Bay   tributaries and temporarily banned harvesting of oysters, clams, and scallops   due to potential contamination from storm waters.
