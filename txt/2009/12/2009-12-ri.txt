The Fifth District economy, on balance, was more mixed than in our last   assessment, with housing, retail, and banking activity marginally increasing and   most other sectors little changed or contracting. An uptick in retail sales   activity was reported, even though most big-ticket sales (with the exception of   new and used vehicles) were still down. Service sector revenue declines were   less widespread. Manufacturing activity, which was increasing in our last two   reports, stalled over the last month, with several contacts concerned that tight   credit was limiting the ability of their customers to place orders. Financial   sector contacts reported little change in overall lending, but noted some   increases in both consumer and small business lending activity. The residential   real estate sector continued to benefit from tax credits for home buyers.   Commercial real estate saw an increase in business downsizing activity, but that   was offset by weakness in other segments of that market. Finally, recent severe   weather disrupted tourism, causing widespread hotel cancellations along the   Atlantic coast. Flooding also damaged crops and delayed planting. While prices   were flat or declining in most sectors, manufacturers noted some increases in   commodity based prices.
Fifth District contacts reported that demand for commercial real estate   remained depressed over the last month. Several agents noted that inquiries from   potential clients often "burn out" quickly due to a lack of confidence in the   economy. However, few contacts were seeing conditions actually getting worse   since our last assessment, and scattered reports of modest increases in leasing   activity were noted. Most of such improvement, however, was limited to   downsizing of office and retail space, as lower rental prices and weakness in   demand motivated tenants to relocate. Vacancy rates remained high throughout the   District and were still rising, but several real estate agents noted some   reductions in areas dominated by health and education services.
