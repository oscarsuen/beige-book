Economic conditions in the Third District have been mixed in recent weeks.   Manufacturers, on balance, reported an increase in shipments and a steady rate   of new orders. Retailers indicated that sales have been rising slowly, although   they remained below the year-ago level for most stores. Motor vehicle dealers   indicated that sales have improved somewhat, although dealer closings continued.   Third District banks generally reported decreasing loan volume outstanding and   further declines in credit quality. Residential real estate agents and home   builders noted mostly unchanged sales rates. Nonresidential real estate leasing   and construction activity continued to decline. Service-sector firms generally   reported that activity continued to be slow. Business firms in the region   reported mostly level prices, although some indicated that prices of some basic   commodities have increased recently.
The outlook in the Third District   business community remained lackluster in November. Manufacturers forecast a   rise in shipments and orders during the next six months, on balance, although   the balance of positive views has eased in the past month. Retailers have mixed   views, but on balance they expect sales for the holiday shopping period this   year to roughly match last year. Auto dealers expect sales to improve in the   near-term, although they say the number of dealers remaining in business will   continue to decline. Bankers anticipate demand for credit to remain weak though   the winter. Residential real estate contacts believe housing demand will   continue to firm up, but they do not expect a substantial increase in sales   until sometime next year. Contacts in nonresidential real estate expect leasing   and construction to remain weak well into 2010. Service-sector firms expect   activity to remain near current levels in the near term.
Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance. Among the firms polled in November, about half   expect new orders and shipments to increase during the next six months; about   one-tenth expect decreases. Although the balance of opinion among area   manufacturers remains positive, it is slightly less optimistic than it was   earlier in the fall. Nevertheless, the number of manufacturing firms planning to   increase capital spending plans has risen slightly.
Most Third District retailers have cautious views of year-end holiday   shopping period. Forecasts vary from slight year-over-year increases to small   year-over-year declines. Retailers, including those expecting gains, have   limited their inventories of merchandise for the holiday period, and many have   shifted their merchandise mix to lower-priced items.
Third District auto   dealers reported some improvement in sales from September through early   November. Dealers said the sales increase, although slight, was widespread   across vehicle types. Nevertheless, closings of dealerships continued throughout   the region, and more are expected. Looking ahead, dealers foresee continued   improvement in sales for those who remain in business.
Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that leasing and purchase activity   has continued to decline and that vacancy rates remain on the rise. Effective   rents have been falling significantly, prompting some relocations and lease   renegotiations by tenants, but no increases in occupied space. Contacts expect   nonresidential real estate markets to remain weak well into next year. One   contact said, "markets will remain under stress and uncertainty."
