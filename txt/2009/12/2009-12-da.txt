Economic conditions in the Eleventh District firmed over the past six weeks.   Activity improved in several industries--including high-tech manufacturing,   paper, petrochemicals, staffing services, housing and energy. Notable exceptions   were financial services and commercial real estate, where contacts noted   deteriorating conditions. Outlooks are generally more positive in tone, although   most respondents do not expect a significant pickup in economic activity in the   near term.
Crude oil prices rose from $70 per barrel in early October to near $80 at the   end of the reporting period in mid November. The increase was only partially   passed through to refined products such as diesel and heating oil. Natural gas   prices were volatile during the reporting period and rose to $4.50 in mid   November. Natural gas inventories continue to rise due to weak industrial demand   and unseasonably warm weather. Prices for chemical products were mixed.
High-tech manufacturing firms said demand continues to grow at the same or   slightly stronger pace since the last Beige Book. Capacity utilization is   increasing, and inventories are at or slightly below desired levels. Most   contacts were cautiously optimistic about the near term.
Reports from transportation manufacturers were mixed. Orders remained weak   for aircraft and parts, but demand for industrial trailers picked up in recent   weeks. Industry outlooks in general were more positive than in previous reports.   Respondents in the paper industry said conditions improved over the past six   weeks. Corrugated container manufacturers were more optimistic than in previous   reports. Food producers noted demand had picked up unexpectedly since the last   report, and outlooks were more positive.
Petrochemical demand remained much the same as in the last report. Domestic   demand increased moderately, and export demand stayed strong--driven by cheap   natural gas versus relatively expensive oil and a weaker dollar. However,   exports to Asia softened over the past several weeks. Refiners have cut   production due to weaker demand and lower margins for diesel and heating   oil.
Automobile sales   improved over the past six weeks after falling sharply at the end of the   cash-for-clunkers program. Most contacts expect conditions to remain flat in the   near term.
Demand for legal services remains flat and depressed, with corporate,   bankruptcy and litigation work still sluggish. Outlooks are bleak and many   contacts expect lower revenues for 2009 compared with last year. Accounting   firms say that demand for their services is holding steady at subdued levels,   and noted a small uptick in inquiries from clients on merger and acquisition   related services.
Intermodal firms reported a slight increase in cargo volumes but said demand   is still well below last year's levels. Shipping firms continue to see a   broad-based increase in large freight volumes, and said small parcel volumes   held steady and were above year-ago levels. Contacts in railroad transportation   noted a sizable and widespread decline in shipments since the last report.   Airlines report conditions have stabilized. Fares are edging up, and demand for   leisure travel has rebounded while that for business travel is slowly improving.
Commercial real estate conditions remain weak. Demand   for existing space continues to fall and rents are trending down. Commercial   construction is at historically low levels. On the financial side, contacts   noted increased uncertainty about the prospect of renegotiating terms on   commercial real estate loans coming due, especially given that the value of   collateral has declined. Debt markets remain challenged, but there are signs   that conditions may be improving. Contacts said some debt providers are becoming   more interested, although they are very selective about assets on which they   will lend.
