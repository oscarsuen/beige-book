Business contacts in the First District cite mixed results amid signs of   improvement, although activity generally remains below year-earlier levels. Some   respondents are beginning to hire and/or reverse pay cuts or freezes, or   planning to in 2010. Prices are generally said to be stable. Contacts in a   number of sectors express uncertainty about whether recent improvements will   last, but most--outside of commercial real estate--expect recovery to take hold   in 2010.
Contacts continue to manage inventory levels cautiously, with several   retailers reporting lower inventory levels than a year ago. Capital spending   remains guarded, but some contacts are taking advantage of favorable   opportunities to expand or budgeting for renovations and IT spending. Some First   District retailers report increasing headcount in line with new store openings,   and others are loosening hiring restrictions. Seasonal hiring is mixed, with   some contacts hiring in anticipation of increased holiday sales and others   scaling back seasonal hires because they anticipate soft holiday sales. Wages   remain mostly steady, although one respondent reports wage cuts were   successfully taken in order to prevent a cut in headcount. Selling prices are   reportedly stable.
Manufacturers report that most materials costs and selling prices remain   steady. Some firms that cut wages and salaries earlier in 2009 have recently   restored pay to pre-cut levels or plan to do so in 2010.
Most contacts say that they have held their domestic headcounts relatively   steady in recent months, but biopharmaceutical firms continue to expand   employment. Several contacts mention that lower-than-normal attrition is   limiting their hiring requirements. Some seeking to fill specialized technical   positions indicate they are disappointed with the quality of the applicant pool.   For the most part, capital spending remains subdued. Many note that they have   adequate cash to fund both needed and discretionary investments.
Most manufacturers and related services providers are anticipating modest to   moderate revenue increases over the coming six to 12 months. Some indicate that   an uneven economic recovery or secular shifts in their industry are likely to   limit their opportunities for growth.
A few contacts express concern that recent FDIC guidance on commercial real   estate will merely serve to delay, rather than prevent, commercial foreclosures   and associated bank losses. In the worst case scenario that some describe,   foreclosure events will be concentrated in time (at some point within the next   two years), triggering greater financial fallout than if they were spread more   evenly. Because they do not expect property values to recover before the coming   wave of maturities come due (even taking into account loan extensions), these   respondents argue that it is preferable for banks to recognize losses sooner   rather than later, or at least to prepare for inevitable losses. On the bright   side, two Boston contacts note that the financing environment is somewhat better   now that it was six to 12 months ago, at least for high-quality properties. A   regional banking contact reports that he has seen a "big uptick" in loan volume   in commercial real estate since the end of September. Increased loan demand has   come from properties seeking refinancing out of loans previously held by life   insurance companies, some of whom are seeking to move such loans off their   books.
Contacts agree that the outlook remains bleak for commercial real estate for   at least another year and possibly two years, but also point out that   uncertainty is high. They reiterate that the key factor leading a recovery will   be improvement in the employment situation.
While sales continue to increase, median home prices continue to decline   year-over-year in New England. The lone exception is the Boston area, where the   median home price in September was up 6 percent from September 2008. In other   areas, the median home price dropped between 2 percent and 8 percent   year-over-year in September. It is difficult to determine what part of this   median price drop can be attributed to increased sales of entry-level homes due   to the tax credit. In New England condo markets, sales were up by at least 10   percent year-over-year, and prices were mixed.
While contacts are pleased by the extension of the first-time homebuyer tax   credit, some are even more excited about the expansion of the credit to include   existing homeowners. Inventory is low in residential real estate markets in   Massachusetts and contacts there hope that this broadening of eligibility for   the tax credit will help bring sellers back into the market.
