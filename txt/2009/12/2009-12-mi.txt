Overall economic activity in the Ninth District was up slightly from the time   of the last report. The services, manufacturing, energy, mining and residential   real estate sectors saw moderate increases. Agriculture and tourism were mixed,   while consumer spending was stable. Decreases in activity occurred in commercial   construction and real estate. Labor markets remained lackluster, but signs of   improvement were noted. Meanwhile, wage increases were modest, and overall   prices remained level.
Tourism conditions were mixed. A Minnesota-based travel agency noted that   business travel was up slightly in September and October compared with a year   earlier, while leisure travel was down about 20 percent. However, holiday   bookings were up slightly compared with last year. Another Minnesota-based   travel agency reported that October showed improvement for both business and   leisure travel, although levels were still below a year ago.
Commercial real estate markets saw continued sluggish activity. A Minneapolis   area commercial real estate firm reported that vacancy increased in all sectors   in the third quarter, with the largest increases in the office and industrial   markets. Retail vacancy increased in markets across the District. Meanwhile, the   residential market continued to recover. The dollar volume of closed sales in   Minneapolis-St. Paul increased nearly 16 percent in October from a year earlier.   Overall sales in Duluth, Minn., were down from a year earlier, but sales of   homes under $150,000 were up as first-time homebuyers took advantage of federal   tax credits. In contrast, the high-end home market in western Montana was very   slow, according to contacts there.
In contrast, a cleaning products manufacturer was adding 200 sales positions   in Minnesota, while another company will create 160 customer service and   management jobs over the next six months in South Dakota. Meanwhile, another   staffing services firm reported increased requests for workers in the   Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
Wage increases were modest. Results of the business outlook poll show that   100 percent of respondents expect wages in their communities to increase no more   than 3 percent next year; a majority expect increases of no more than 1 percent.   A bank director noted that recent compensation levels in the agricultural   industry in eastern Montana and western South Dakota were on par with last   year.
Prices remained relatively level. According to the survey of manufacturers,   23 percent of respondents expect to increase their product prices over the next   12 months while 24 percent expect to decrease prices. Bank directors reported   that prices for steel, industrial grade lumber and zinc were up, while prices   for cattle were down.
