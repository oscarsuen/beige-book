Economic activity in the Eighth District remained weak but showed signs of   improvement in some areas. Manufacturing activity continued to decline while   services activity began to expand in many areas of the District. Compared with a   year ago, retail sales declined in October and early November, while auto sales   increased over the same period. Residential and commercial real estate market   conditions continued to be weak. Overall lending at a sample of large District   banks declined in the three-month period ending in October.
Car dealers in the District reported that, compared with last year, sales in   October and early November were up, on average. About 39 percent of the car   dealers surveyed saw increases in sales, while 39 percent saw decreases and 22   percent saw no changes. About 26 percent of the car dealers noted that used car   sales had increased relative to new car sales, while 22 percent reported the   opposite. Also, 26 percent reported an increase in low-end vehicle sales   relative to high-end vehicle sales, while 13 percent reported the opposite.   About 27 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported that their inventories   were too low, while 9 percent reported that their inventories were too high. The   sales outlook among car dealers for the rest of the year was also mixed. About   48 percent of the car dealers expect sales for the rest of the year to increase   over 2008 levels, but 39 percent expect sales to decrease. The remaining 13   percent expect sales to be similar to last year.
The District's service sector has begun to expand in many areas since our   previous report. Contacts in business support services announced plans for   several new facilities and new hires in the District. In contrast, some workers   in education services experienced pay cuts because of budget deficits.
Commercial and industrial real estate markets continued to struggle   throughout most of the District. Compared with the second quarter of 2009,   third-quarter 2009 industrial vacancy rates increased in Little Rock, Memphis,   and St. Louis and remained the same in Louisville. During the same period,   suburban and downtown office vacancy rates decreased in Little Rock, increased   in Louisville and St. Louis, and remained the same in Memphis. Contacts   throughout the District noted, however, that total available commercial and   industrial space is considerably higher than vacancy rates suggest when   factoring in sub-leases offered by companies that have reduced staff. Commercial   and industrial construction markets continued their decline. A contact in   northeast Arkansas reported that commercial construction was very slow, with few   projects even in the planning stage. A contact in south central Kentucky noted   that overall commercial construction continues to lag behind the number of   projects in recent years. A contact in St. Louis reported that industrial   construction had fallen sharply compared with the same time last year.
