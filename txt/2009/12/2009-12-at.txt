Economic activity was mixed in October through mid-November, according to   reports from Sixth District business contacts. A majority of retailers described   activity as exceeding their modest expectations, while tourism-related spending   and automobile sales remained weak. However, the outlook for tourism improved as   year-end bookings surpassed expectations. Home sales for most District   residential real estate markets were above low year-ago levels. New residential   construction activity remained minimal and concentrated in lower price points.   The District's office and industrial markets worsened as construction levels and   rents declined and vacancy rates rose. However, several contacts indicated that   commercial construction activity showed signs of bottoming out at low levels.   Although overall manufacturing activity continued to decline, the decline   moderated and more manufacturing contacts reported improved orders. Bank lending   activity continued to be sluggish because of weak demand and tight credit   standards. The pace of layoffs in the District slowed, and some businesses   reported hiring temporary workers in response to an uptick in activity. Price   pressures remained stable and most businesses had no plans of increasing prices   in the near term.
Tourism-related spending remained sluggish throughout the District. Industry   contacts reported that hotel reservations, particularly related to conventions,   were down and room rates continued to decline. Cruise ships remained fully   booked because of deep discounts. The outlook for tourism was more optimistic   with several reports indicating that year-end and early 2010 bookings were   coming in above expectations.
Contractors commented on the difficulty in competing with bank-owned homes   and lots that continued to enter the market. Realtors noted that the housing   stimulus continued to drive sales at the low-end of the market, while sales at   the high-end of the market remained weak. Several real estate contacts remarked   that qualifying for loans remained challenging. The outlook over the next   several months softened somewhat for homebuilders but improved notably among   Realtors.
Commercial construction activity continued to decline, but several   contractors noted that the amount of projects in development has improved   modestly in recent months. Vacancy rates increased and contacts continued to   report downward pressure on rents. Declines in net absorption began to abate   across much of the District, however.
District contacts from a wide variety of industries continued to report   stable prices relative to last year. Most businesses reported having little   pricing power and felt that they would need to see a sustained increase in sales   before raising prices.
District growers enjoyed improved weather conditions through mid-November,   which allowed them to resume normal fieldwork activities. Some Georgia growers   were negatively affected by excessive rains.
