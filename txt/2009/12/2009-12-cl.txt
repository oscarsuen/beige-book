Economic conditions in the Fourth District have shown little change since our   last report; overall activity is sluggish and the recovery remains fragile.   Reports from factories indicated that production was flat or up slightly, with   increases being attributed to new orders and seasonal demand. New home sales   proceeded at a slow pace, while commercial and industrial construction was very   sluggish. Financing remains a major issue for residential and commercial   builders. Sales by District retailers and auto dealers were generally flat.   Declines in coal production have leveled out, with oil and gas output holding   steady. Reports indicated little change in freight transport volume. Business   and consumer lending weakened further, while core deposits continued to   grow.
Large scale employment reductions have flattened out across most sectors,   with some companies recalling a small number of workers. Staffing firm   representatives reported an uptick in job openings across a wide spectrum of   industries. Given the weak labor market, wage pressures are contained. We heard   many reports of fluctuating commodity prices, especially from manufacturers and   food producers. Otherwise, construction materials and product pricing were   relatively stable. Capital spending and inventories remain under very tight   control.
Manufacturers reported that they have either completed rebalancing their   inventories or continue to cut back. Capacity utilization is holding steady, but   at rates substantially below pre-recession levels. While little incentive exists   to invest in capital projects at this time, about a third of our respondents   indicated that they would consider increasing spending in 2010 if warranted by   more favorable business conditions. We heard many reports of fluctuating   commodity prices, especially for metals. However, most affected manufacturers   held back on raising their own prices. On net, there was little change in   staffing levels, and wage pressures are contained.
Commercial and industrial (C&I) construction continues to be very   sluggish, though activity in public works projects is relatively stable. Most of   our respondents said that business has fallen substantially on a year-over-year   basis. Inquiries are coming in at a slow pace, while several builders reported   having nearly depleted their backlogs. Looking forward, contractors involved in   public works projects are cautiously optimistic, while their C&I   counterparts expect very slow activity through mid-2011. We continue to hear   numerous accounts of difficulties in obtaining financing, resulting in some   projects being postponed or cancelled. On net, there has been little change in   construction material costs. About half of our respondents reported reducing   employment as they pare down their backlogs. Many subcontractors are struggling   to find work and are contracting below cost just to stay busy.
