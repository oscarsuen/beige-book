Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to pick up modestly during   the reporting period of late October through late November. Upward pressures on   prices and wages were largely absent. Consumer demand remained weak but showed   signs of improvement in some retail categories, and demand for services appeared   to be little changed on net. Manufacturing activity was mixed but appeared to   firm a bit further overall. Agricultural producers reported largely stable   sales, while demand remained somewhat weak for providers of energy resources.   Demand for housing exhibited further modest improvement, but conditions   continued to erode in commercial real estate markets. Banking contacts reported   largely stable loan demand and lending standards but further declines in credit   quality.
Contacts reported little or no upward wage pressures. High levels of   unemployment held down wage pressures throughout the District, and contacts   expect this to continue for an extended period as labor demand and hiring remain   subdued. Employers in various sectors also have been implementing cost-saving   measures such as suspending their 401(k) match and increasing employee   contributions for health benefits. Nonetheless, many businesses expect   significant increases in the costs of health insurance benefits in the coming   year, based on contracted or anticipated rate increases.
Demand for services remained very weak on net. Demand fell further for   providers of professional services such as accounting and legal services.   Contacts in the restaurant and food services industry noted that demand held   largely stable, albeit at a very low level. Similarly, providers of real estate   services such as title insurance reported that activity was largely flat at low   levels. Conditions remained challenging but showed further signs of improvement   in the tourism and leisure sector: contacts in Southern California indicated   that the sharp rate of decline in hotel and resort visits is slowing, and   contacts in Hawaii continued to report firming in visitor arrivals and hotel   occupancy rates.
