Economic activity  in the Fourth District has weakened further since our last report.   The downward trend in factory output and steel shipments that  began late in the third quarter of 2008 continued.  Residential construction remains very weak,  with no improvement expected during 2009, while commercial builders reported a  significant slowdown in construction activity.   Sales by District retailers did show a slight improvement, but purchases  of new motor vehicles remained at very low levels.  Even though industrial demand has been  falling, there was little change in energy production.  Freight transport volume remains at low  levels.  Finally, regional bankers told  us that commercial and industrial lending is flat to down, while community  banks experienced some growth in C&I loans. Employment dropped  across all industry sectors except energy and healthcare.  Staffing firms reported an overall decline in  job openings as well.  Given the weak  labor market, wage pressures are contained.   Capital spending has been trimmed back significantly from 2008 levels,  and further cutbacks are contemplated.   Almost all of our respondents affiliated with manufacturing,  construction, and energy companies report that raw materials prices were stable  or falling. Manufacturing Output by most District factories remained at  low levels during the past six weeks.   Any increased production was attributed to seasonal adjustments or the  exit of market competitors.  On a  year-over-year basis, factory output fell by more than 25 percent on  average.  Respondents expect demand will  remain very soft during the next few months.   Almost all steel producers and service centers reported a  worse-than-expected slump in shipping volume.   The only end markets cited as showing some stability were energy and  aerospace.  Further, respondents believe  that the demand for steel will remain at very low levels through at least the  first half of 2009.  District auto  production declined precipitously during January on a month-over-month and  year-over-year basis.  The declines were  felt by both domestic makers and foreign nameplates.  A significant part of the downturn on the  domestic side is attributable to an extended year-end shutdown of a small-car  assembly plant and the permanent closing of a plant that produced SUVs. Half of our  contacts said that their companies have trimmed back or halted capital  expenditures during the past couple of months.   Further, most of them expect additional cutbacks or a freeze on spending  during 2009.  We heard only a few reports  of customers falling behind in payments on their accounts receivable.  Suppliers to the residential construction  industry cited difficulties obtaining credit.   A majority of our contacts told us that raw materials prices, especially  for metals, have fallen since our last report.   Product pricing remains relatively stable, with some reductions  noted.  Manufacturers expect little  inflationary pressure during 2009.   Almost all of our survey respondents have laid off employees or  increased the number of nonproduction days.  Predictably, wage pressures are contained. Real  Estate The residential construction industry remains very weak.  Two contractors noted that January sales were  slightly better than anticipated, and most of our contacts reported a rise in  Internet and foot traffic.  Nevertheless,  builders are not expecting an industry turnaround through 2009, which they  attributed to a lack of consumer confidence, tight credit, and excess  inventory.  There has been little change  in the list prices of new homes, though builders are discounting.  We continue to see some moderation in the  prices of building materials and labor costs.   General contractors and subcontractors reported minimal staff reductions. Almost all the  commercial builders we contacted told us there has been a significant slowing  in construction activity during the past couple of months, and they expect this  trend will continue through 2009.  The  only market segments cited as showing some stability were public works and  energy.  Contractors continue to pare  down their backlogs, while inquiries have fallen off.  Bidding on any new projects is very  aggressive, as is subcontractor pricing.   Construction materials prices have declined, especially for metal  products.  A majority of our contacts  have laid off employees. Consumer  Spending January sales for District retailers improved slightly on a  month-over-month basis across nearly all industry segments.  However, most survey respondents expect sales  will flatten out or decline in the upcoming months.  The exception is food sellers, who anticipate  a small pickup in sales.  On balance,  there has been little change in vendor or retail pricing since our last  report.  Accounts from auto dealers show  that purchases of new vehicles remain at very low levels, while used vehicles  sales have improved.  Dealers are not  expecting an industry turnaround during the next few months.  We heard numerous reports of retailers and  auto dealers eliminating sales and front office positions and cutting back on  store hours. Capital expenditures by retailers have  been trimmed back significantly from 2008 levels. Banking Regional  bankers told us that commercial and industrial lending is flat to down, while community banks reported increased demand for C&I loans.  A majority of banking executives experienced some  upward pressure on loan rates.  On  the consumer side, lending is stable to up, with several bankers commenting  that home equity lines of credit remain the bright spot in their loan  portfolios.  Pricing for consumer loans  showed little change.  Refinancing  applications for residential mortgages remain at high levels.  Credit quality for consumer and business loan  applicants has deteriorated, while the number of loan delinquencies increased  across nearly all categories.  Still,  most contacts do not anticipate any further tightening of credit  standards.  Core deposits rose since our  last report, with several bankers noting that deposit pricing is still very  competitive.  Major regional banks cut  staff significantly, while community banks trimmed staff through controlled attrition.  Several respondents' institutions reduced or  eliminated merit increases. Energy On balance, energy production has been  stable during the past six weeks, with little change expected during the  upcoming months.  Nevertheless, nearly  all of our contacts commented that industrial demand has been falling.  Further, most oil and gas producers  significantly reduced drilling activity.   Prices received for oil and natural gas continued to drop, while coal  prices were stable.  For the most part,  materials and equipment costs were stable or falling.  Capital expenditures remained on plan;  however, several producers told us that they intend to lower spending during  the next few months.  Access to credit  was cited as an issue by an increasing number of our respondents.  Employment levels were stable with little  wage pressure. Transportation Shipping volumes for freight transport  service companies remained at low levels, with little volume change over the  past six weeks.  On a year-over-year  basis, January shipments were down 15 percent on average.  The only market segment exhibiting some  stability was energy, particularly coal.   Expectations call for activity to remain at current levels or to decline  further during 2009.  Few problems in  collecting on accounts receivable were reported, other than some slowdown in  payments.  Several trucking executives  noted a small increase in the price of diesel fuel and significant increases in  turnpike tolls, which they are unable to pass through to customers.  Little change in capital spending was  reported; though most companies have reduced expenditures to the replacement  level.  Several trucking executives are  laying off drivers as part of their capacity reduction plans, while others did  not replace drivers who have left voluntarily.
