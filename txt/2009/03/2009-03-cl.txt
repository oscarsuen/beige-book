Employment dropped  across all industry sectors except energy and healthcare.  Staffing firms reported an overall decline in  job openings as well.  Given the weak  labor market, wage pressures are contained.   Capital spending has been trimmed back significantly from 2008 levels,  and further cutbacks are contemplated.   Almost all of our respondents affiliated with manufacturing,  construction, and energy companies report that raw materials prices were stable  or falling.
Half of our  contacts said that their companies have trimmed back or halted capital  expenditures during the past couple of months.   Further, most of them expect additional cutbacks or a freeze on spending  during 2009.  We heard only a few reports  of customers falling behind in payments on their accounts receivable.  Suppliers to the residential construction  industry cited difficulties obtaining credit.   A majority of our contacts told us that raw materials prices, especially  for metals, have fallen since our last report.   Product pricing remains relatively stable, with some reductions  noted.  Manufacturers expect little  inflationary pressure during 2009.   Almost all of our survey respondents have laid off employees or  increased the number of nonproduction days.  Predictably, wage pressures are contained.
Almost all the  commercial builders we contacted told us there has been a significant slowing  in construction activity during the past couple of months, and they expect this  trend will continue through 2009.  The  only market segments cited as showing some stability were public works and  energy.  Contractors continue to pare  down their backlogs, while inquiries have fallen off.  Bidding on any new projects is very  aggressive, as is subcontractor pricing.   Construction materials prices have declined, especially for metal  products.  A majority of our contacts  have laid off employees.
