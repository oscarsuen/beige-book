The broad-based  economic downturn continued in the Ninth District. Activity weakened since the  last report in consumer spending, tourism, services, construction and real estate,  manufacturing, energy, mining and agriculture. Labor  markets continued to deteriorate as a number of companies announced layoffs. Overall  wage increases remained modest. Prices remained  relatively stable since the last report; many prices were lower compared with a  year ago.
Overall retail sales were lower than a year ago. A major  Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in January were down  3.3 percent compared with a year earlier. A Minnesota-based furniture retailer  reported that recent sales continued to lag year-earlier levels. An outdoor  goods retailer in Minnesota reported that recent sales were flat compared with  last year. Preliminary January sales reports at a  Montana mall improved from December levels, according to the manager. A  representative of an auto dealers association in North Dakota reported slower  activity than last year. Auto dealers in southwestern Montana reported some  improvements in sales during January after fairly dismal sales during the last  part of 2008. On a positive note, a new anchor department store and a fitness  center have helped traffic increase 20 percent in January at a Minneapolis area  mall.
Tourism activity was slower than last winter. A ski resort in Montana  noted that lodging revenue was down 15 percent compared with a year earlier. A Minnesota ski resort reported that sales were down 15  percent through mid-February, but pre-sales for March and early April have  recently picked up. In contrast, good snow conditions have helped buoy tourism  activity in western South Dakota.
Services  sector activity decreased overall since the last report. Contacts from the  legal sector noted a downturn in business. Architects reported continued weak  demand. Several media services companies cut back on content. Hospitals  reported weakening demand for elective services, but an uptick in emergency  services, as consumers are shifting from clinics. However, some information  technology firms noted solid demand from companies investing in cost-reduction  projects. Several appraisers and mortgage companies noted a big increase in  refinance activity.
Commercial  construction activity decreased. January commercial permits decreased in Sioux  Falls, S.D. A commercial developer in Fargo, N.D., said activity there had  decreased, but the area was faring better than in many others. A Minneapolis  commercial real estate firm forecast flat office and industrial construction in  2009 from the previous year. However, developers were optimistic about the  impact of the federal fiscal stimulus package. Residential construction decreased  slightly. The number of permitted units in Minneapolis-St. Paul was down 7  percent in January from the previous year. The number of January residential permits  declined in Sioux Falls.
The  commercial real estate market weakened. A Minneapolis-St. Paul commercial real  estate firm noted that vacancy has increased for the office, industrial and  retail segments; it forecast a decline in lease rates, as it expects newly  completed projects to outpace absorption. In Sioux Falls, a commercial real  estate agent said the market has softened. Residential real estate remained  slow, with possible signs of nearing bottom. January closed sales in  Minneapolis-St. Paul increased 2 percent over the previous year; prices were  down more than 24 percent, as more than half of sales were due to lender-mediated  foreclosure or short-sale activity. A real estate agent in Fargo described the  market there as slower than in recent years, but still brisk overall. A bank  director in western Montana said mid-priced homes were still selling well, but  luxury homes were taking longer to sell or were pulled from the market.
Manufacturing activity decreased since the last  report. A January survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha,  Neb.) indicated that activity significantly decreased in Minnesota and South  Dakota, and slightly decreased in North Dakota. Several manufacturers decreased  production since the last report. A Minnesota window maker announced production  cuts, a fiberglass producer plans to close a plant and a metal cab maker  reduced production. In South Dakota, a respirator plant temporarily shut down and  a computer component producer plans to shut down.
Activity in the energy and mining  sectors fell since the last report. Mid-February oil and gas exploration  declined significantly from early January. Several ethanol plants went up for  auction. A Montana metals mine recently reduced production.Â  A large cooperative energy utility noted  decreased demand after adjusting for weather patterns.
Agricultural conditions deteriorated  since the last report. Results of the Minneapolis Fed's fourth-quarter (January  2009) survey of agricultural credit conditions indicated that lenders expect  overall agricultural income and spending to decrease significantly in the first  quarter of 2009. "The agriculture economy is looking a little tough due to  lower prices in both the livestock and grain markets," commented a Montana  respondent to the survey. Meanwhile, milk prices dropped significantly since  last December.
Labor markets continued to deteriorate, with a number of  companies announcing layoffs. After cutting 2,400 jobs companywide in the  fourth quarter, a Minnesota-based manufacturer indicated that more cuts are  likely in 2009. Similarly, a Minnesota-based telecommunications firm that laid  off 350 employees in October said more layoffs were to come. Also in Minnesota, a window  maker plans to eliminate 50 positions and temporarily lay off about 400  workers, a cleaning and sanitizing products maker is cutting 200 jobs and a  financial services company is cutting 100 jobs. In addition, a snowmobile and  utility vehicle manufacturer announced plans to lay off more than 110  employees, while a nearby competitor will lay off 100 employees. Falling oil prices led to about 150 layoffs in western  North Dakota. A company that makes processing equipment for the  semiconductor industry recently announced plans to lay off 200 employees in  Montana after cutting 100 workers in November. A job service center in Montana  reported seeing many more people per day in January than in the past, and job  seekers were less selective about job openings.
Overall wage increases remained modest, and examples of pay  cuts or freezes were noted. Some companies that announced layoffs reported that  executives and, in some cases, other employees received cuts in their  compensation packages. State workers in South Dakota recently accepted a freeze  in pay levels.
Prices  remained relatively stable since the last report; many prices were lower  compared with a year ago. Minnesota gasoline prices in mid-February were about  35 cents higher than at the end of December, but were about $1 lower than a  year ago. Metal prices remained much lower than a year ago after decreasing sharply  last fall.
