The broad-based  economic downturn continued in the Ninth District. Activity weakened since the  last report in consumer spending, tourism, services, construction and real estate,  manufacturing, energy, mining and agriculture. Labor  markets continued to deteriorate as a number of companies announced layoffs. Overall  wage increases remained modest. Prices remained  relatively stable since the last report; many prices were lower compared with a  year ago.
Tourism activity was slower than last winter. A ski resort in Montana  noted that lodging revenue was down 15 percent compared with a year earlier. A Minnesota ski resort reported that sales were down 15  percent through mid-February, but pre-sales for March and early April have  recently picked up. In contrast, good snow conditions have helped buoy tourism  activity in western South Dakota.
The  commercial real estate market weakened. A Minneapolis-St. Paul commercial real  estate firm noted that vacancy has increased for the office, industrial and  retail segments; it forecast a decline in lease rates, as it expects newly  completed projects to outpace absorption. In Sioux Falls, a commercial real  estate agent said the market has softened. Residential real estate remained  slow, with possible signs of nearing bottom. January closed sales in  Minneapolis-St. Paul increased 2 percent over the previous year; prices were  down more than 24 percent, as more than half of sales were due to lender-mediated  foreclosure or short-sale activity. A real estate agent in Fargo described the  market there as slower than in recent years, but still brisk overall. A bank  director in western Montana said mid-priced homes were still selling well, but  luxury homes were taking longer to sell or were pulled from the market.
Overall wage increases remained modest, and examples of pay  cuts or freezes were noted. Some companies that announced layoffs reported that  executives and, in some cases, other employees received cuts in their  compensation packages. State workers in South Dakota recently accepted a freeze  in pay levels.
Prices  remained relatively stable since the last report; many prices were lower  compared with a year ago. Minnesota gasoline prices in mid-February were about  35 cents higher than at the end of December, but were about $1 lower than a  year ago. Metal prices remained much lower than a year ago after decreasing sharply  last fall.
