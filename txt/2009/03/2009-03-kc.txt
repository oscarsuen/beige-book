Economic  conditions in the Tenth District continued to deteriorate in January and early  February.  Consumers retrenched further,  shying away from durable goods and curtailing restaurant dining and  travel.  Manufacturing activity and  capital spending weakened further, and the decline in real estate activity  intensified as construction weakened further and home prices maintained their  downward trend.  Energy activity dampened  significantly as drilling waned and rig counts hit five-year lows.  Farm incomes declined with crop and livestock  prices.  Lack of demand and wide  availability put downward pressure on prices of raw materials and finished  goods, but wages and salaries remained steady.
