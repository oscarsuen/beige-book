Economic activity in the Twelfth District slowed further during the survey  period of January through late February.   Upward price pressures continued to ease in general along with the  prices of energy and other commodities, and upward wage pressures were virtually  nonexistent.  Retail sales remained very  sluggish with the exception of necessities such as basic groceries, and demand  weakened further for service providers.   District manufacturing activity continued to decline on net.  Demand weakened for agricultural producers  and fell further for oil extractors.   District housing markets remained moribund, and demand for commercial  real estate continued to fall.  Contacts  from financial institutions reported further weakening in loan demand and  continued tight credit conditions. Wages and Prices Upward  pressures on prices eased further during the survey period.  Declining demand reduced sellers' pricing  power in many sectors, and price discounts deepened for assorted retail  items.  Prices declined further for  energy and many commodities, including various construction materials and food  products.  Gasoline prices rose but  remained well below the highs reached last year. Upward  wage pressures remained modest to nonexistent on net.  Hiring freezes and restricted work schedules  have become commonplace, and unemployment rose significantly throughout the  District.  Compensation increases were  very limited in general:  many employers  have frozen or cut wages, eliminated incentive pay, or reduced benefit costs,  for example through the elimination of 401(k) matching programs.  Reports indicate that some companies that  have not yet reduced workforces or cut compensation costs plan to do so soon. Retail Trade and Services Retail  sales remained anemic.  Consumers continued  to shift away from discretionary spending and focus on necessities, reducing  their overall spending and causing somewhat better performance for discount  chains compared with traditional department stores.  Many retailers saw double-digit sales declines  relative to 12 months earlier, although contacts in the grocery industry  reported that sales have grown in recent months.  Demand remained especially weak for  furniture, appliances, and electronic items.   New automobile sales, both domestic and foreign, remained feeble, but  sales and prices stayed relatively firm for used vehicles. Demand  for services continued to decline since the last survey period.  Contacts in the restaurant and food services  industry noted sharp sales declines accompanied by growing layoffs and  closures.  Providers of health-care  services saw further drops in patient volumes, attributed largely to  postponement of elective procedures and cutbacks in government-funded medical  programs.  Demand weakened significantly  for providers of professional services such as accounting, business consulting,  and legal services, with ongoing layoffs noted.   Travel activity in the District fell further, and airlines responded by  reducing passenger capacity.  In Hawaii,  sharp ongoing declines in visitor arrivals caused further layoffs at hotels and  resorts, and contacts in Southern California reported growing cancellations of  corporate travel commitments. Manufacturing District manufacturing activity languished  during the survey period.  Producers of  wood products, transportation equipment, and construction equipment saw further  declines in demand.  New orders and sales  of semiconductors and other information technology products continued to fall,  causing layoffs and further reductions in capacity utilization for many  firms.  Contacts in the metal fabrication  industry reported very weak demand and capacity utilization rates in the range  of 25 to 50 percent.  Aerospace manufacturers  continued to produce commercial aircraft at a brisk clip, but reductions in  airline capacity have weakened the outlook for new orders going forward, and  orders for small corporate jets have dropped significantly of late.  Food manufacturers remained a bright spot,  seeing strong demand overall as growing sales to grocery stores more than  offset declining sales to restaurants.   Several contacts noted that an inability to raise sufficient financial  capital has been hampering current operations. Agriculture and Resource-related Industries Demand  slipped somewhat for agricultural producers and weakened further for oil  extractors.  The pace of sales slowed for  an assortment of agricultural products, notably livestock, dairy, and  wheat.  Agricultural input costs,  particularly for fuel, transportation services, and fertilizer, reportedly have  stabilized at levels well below the highs established last year.  However, California farmers faced supply  constraints and higher prices for water, and they expect supply to tighten  further as the growing season proceeds.   For oil extractors, ongoing declines in global demand caused further  reductions in sales and rising inventories. Real Estate and  Construction Activity  in the District's housing markets remained mired at very low levels, and  considerable demand declines were reported for commercial real estate.  The pace of home sales stayed very slow in  most areas, despite some pickup in recent months as price declines have  increased affordability, and construction of new homes was limited.  Conditions in the commercial office market  deteriorated noticeably, as leasing activity slowed further and vacancy rates  continued to rise.  Contacts reported  that restricted credit availability has held down construction activity in both  sectors of late.  Construction projects  funded by state and local governments fell further during the survey period as  a result of budgetary constraints. Financial  Institutions District  banking contacts reported that loan demand continued to weaken and credit conditions  remained tight.  Many businesses have  scaled back their capital investment plans, causing demand for commercial and  industrial loans to fall further, and the market for commercial and residential  real estate loans continued to wane.   Declining asset values and rising loan losses caused banks and other  financial institutions, such as money management firms, to scale back activity  and lay off significant numbers of employees.   Credit quality continued to deteriorate, as weakness in corporate and household  borrowers' balance sheets and income statements deepened, and bank lending  standards remained stringent on net.
