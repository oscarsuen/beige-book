Real Estate and  Construction Activity  in the District's housing markets remained mired at very low levels, and  considerable demand declines were reported for commercial real estate.  The pace of home sales stayed very slow in  most areas, despite some pickup in recent months as price declines have  increased affordability, and construction of new homes was limited.  Conditions in the commercial office market  deteriorated noticeably, as leasing activity slowed further and vacancy rates  continued to rise.  Contacts reported  that restricted credit availability has held down construction activity in both  sectors of late.  Construction projects  funded by state and local governments fell further during the survey period as  a result of budgetary constraints.
Financial  Institutions District  banking contacts reported that loan demand continued to weaken and credit conditions  remained tight.  Many businesses have  scaled back their capital investment plans, causing demand for commercial and  industrial loans to fall further, and the market for commercial and residential  real estate loans continued to wane.   Declining asset values and rising loan losses caused banks and other  financial institutions, such as money management firms, to scale back activity  and lay off significant numbers of employees.   Credit quality continued to deteriorate, as weakness in corporate and household  borrowers' balance sheets and income statements deepened, and bank lending  standards remained stringent on net.
