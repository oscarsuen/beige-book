Economic activity in the Twelfth District slowed further during the survey  period of January through late February.   Upward price pressures continued to ease in general along with the  prices of energy and other commodities, and upward wage pressures were virtually  nonexistent.  Retail sales remained very  sluggish with the exception of necessities such as basic groceries, and demand  weakened further for service providers.   District manufacturing activity continued to decline on net.  Demand weakened for agricultural producers  and fell further for oil extractors.   District housing markets remained moribund, and demand for commercial  real estate continued to fall.  Contacts  from financial institutions reported further weakening in loan demand and  continued tight credit conditions.
Upward  wage pressures remained modest to nonexistent on net.  Hiring freezes and restricted work schedules  have become commonplace, and unemployment rose significantly throughout the  District.  Compensation increases were  very limited in general:  many employers  have frozen or cut wages, eliminated incentive pay, or reduced benefit costs,  for example through the elimination of 401(k) matching programs.  Reports indicate that some companies that  have not yet reduced workforces or cut compensation costs plan to do so soon.
Demand  for services continued to decline since the last survey period.  Contacts in the restaurant and food services  industry noted sharp sales declines accompanied by growing layoffs and  closures.  Providers of health-care  services saw further drops in patient volumes, attributed largely to  postponement of elective procedures and cutbacks in government-funded medical  programs.  Demand weakened significantly  for providers of professional services such as accounting, business consulting,  and legal services, with ongoing layoffs noted.   Travel activity in the District fell further, and airlines responded by  reducing passenger capacity.  In Hawaii,  sharp ongoing declines in visitor arrivals caused further layoffs at hotels and  resorts, and contacts in Southern California reported growing cancellations of  corporate travel commitments.
