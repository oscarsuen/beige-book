The Eleventh District  economy weakened further in January and the first half of February. Falling  demand was reported across a broad range of industries, with manufacturers and  energy respondents noting the largest declines. Outlooks remain pessimistic,  and many contacts expect little improvement through year-end.
From  January through mid February, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil  fluctuated between $48 and $34 per barrel. An inventory improvement put the  price near $40 as the survey period ended in the third week of February. While  retail diesel prices fell by about 11 cents per gallon, gasoline prices are up  about 25 cents since early this year as demand has strengthened to year-ago  levels. Natural gas prices fell to a six-year low of near $4.00.
Producers  of construction-related manufacturing products said orders continued to fall  over the past six weeks. More than one respondent expressed concern about  whether their firm would make it through the current downturn, and several  noted competitors or customers had gone out of business or filed for Chapter  11. Bookings for residential building materials were down sharply and contacts  reported layoffs and plant closings. Metals producers that supply to the  nonresidential construction sector said orders were unexpectedly low as  commercial activity weakened, the only exception being demand tied to  institutional/public works construction. Outlooks were grim among  construction-related respondents, with most not expecting any improvement this  year.
Eleventh  District respondents in high-tech manufacturing reported continued declines in production  and orders.Â  Reductions in demand were  widespread across most products and areas of the world. Layoffs and temporary  plant shutdowns have increased since the last survey. Most contacts said they  were aggressively cutting inventories to very lean levels. One semiconductor  respondent expects demand to fall through the first quarter as industries that  use semiconductors in production reduce inventories. While most contacts noted  the outlook remains particularly uncertain, most expect some improvement by  year-end.
Demand  for paper products was mixed. After falling late last year, orders of  corrugated boxes held mostly steady over the past six weeks, although demand is  below year-ago levels. Manufacturers of printing paper said demand softened  further during the survey period, after accounting for a normal seasonal  slowdown. Inventories were reportedly bloated, and some contacts were reducing  payrolls.
Weak  orders for autos and aircraft continue to hamper the transportation  manufacturing sector, yet sales of some specialized products rose. Contacts in  the food processing industry said sales growth of food products has flattened  out, but contacts are satisfied with current levels and expect growth to remain  steady in coming months. Most respondents noted stable prices.
Refiners'  margins slowly improved from very low levels in December. Contacts said the  last couple of weeks have been quite good, although operating rates were relatively  weak and fell through the survey period. Although petrochemical prices continue  to fall significantly, demand improved slightly in January as customers who had  worked down their inventories began to re-order. Still, contacts said orders  were on an "as-needed" basis only. February has not shown signs of continued  demand improvement.
Auto  sales held steady at low levels in recent weeks and contacts are hopeful this  signals the bottom. With many incentives already in place prices are not  expected to go any lower. Respondents expect the next 15 months to be tough and  expect several franchise dealers to go out of business in 2009.
Eleventh  District-based airlines report demand continues to fall and fares are following  suit. International passenger traffic is down substantially. Most airlines were  re-assessing business strategies. Respondents in intermodal transportation said  cargo volume continued to fall since the last survey, a result of the decline  in demand for imports and the decrease in exports. Large parcel express air and  ground cargos continued to be negatively impacted by poor U.S. retail sales. On  a brighter note, railroad shipments rebounded slightly in recent weeks,  although contacts still expect a difficult year ahead.
Commercial real estate transactions remain  minimal, yet some contacts noted that "price rediscovery" of real estate assets  was starting to happen. Still, most contacts said uncertainty about the size of  the write-downs was keeping lenders and sellers on the sidelines. Office  leasing activity remained slow but "ok," according to contacts. The outlook for  commercial real estate remains uncertain given that many loans are coming due  amid the difficult financing environment. Contacts expect nonresidential  construction to decline in 2009.
