Car dealers reported that,  compared with last year, sales in January and early February were down, on  average.  About 74 percent of the car  dealers surveyed reported a decrease in sales, while 9 percent reported the opposite.  About 35 percent of the car dealers noted  that used car sales had increased relative to new car sales.  About 48 percent reported more rejections of  finance applications.  About 42 percent  of the car dealers surveyed reported that their inventories were too high  (mostly for new cars), while 17 percent reported that their inventories were  too low (mostly for used or low-end cars).   About 62 percent of the car dealers expect decreased sales over 2008  levels for March and April, but 24 percent expect sales to increase.  The remaining contacts expect sales to be  similar to last year.
The District's services sector  continued to decline in most areas since our previous report.  Firms in the leisure/hospitality, business  support, education, and transportation services industries cut jobs.  In addition, firms in medical services,  transportation services, business support services, and information services  reduced payroll expenses through pay cuts, required time off without pay, or  demotions.  In contrast, two contacts in  the financial services industry reported plans to expand operations and hire  additional workers.  A firm in business  support services also hired new workers to handle increased demand.
Commercial real estate market  conditions were mixed throughout the District while commercial construction  markets were generally slow.  Compared  with third-quarter 2008, fourth-quarter 2008 industrial vacancy rates decreased  in Little Rock and Louisville but increased in Memphis and St. Louis.  During the same period, suburban office  vacancy rates decreased in Louisville and Memphis but increased in Little Rock  and St. Louis.  Downtown office  vacancy rates decreased in Memphis but increased in St. Louis, Louisville,  and Little Rock.  A contact in northeast  Arkansas reported that overall commercial construction is at a standstill.  A commercial construction contact in  Louisville reported fewer requests for new project bids as business owners are  holding back in the uncertain environment.
