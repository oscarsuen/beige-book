Activity at District ports weakened further since our  last report. Imports declined amid continued concerns about consumer spending  and inventory levels, while exports struggled across the board over the last  two months. Contacts across the District reported seeing shipping lines scale  back operations in recent weeks by delaying or consolidating services.
District  commercial real estate markets remained stagnant from January to mid-February. Leasing  activity declined in most areas, although contacts reported some interest in  office space in northern Virginia, Norfolk, Va., and Charlotte N.C. While  posted rental rates were unchanged in most markets, negotiation was more common  and landlord concessions were on the rise. A Baltimore, Md.,  agent reported that there was "no point asking what the face rent is--it's all  about what tenants can afford." Concessions grew in Columbia, S.C.,  as landlords "scrambled" to renew leases, while tenants in Norfolk and Charlotte sought rent relief to avoid  defaulting on contracts. Vacancy rates rose in Baltimore, Washington, D.C.,  Raleigh, N.C., and Charleston, S.C.,--especially from a glut of big box retail  space coming on to those markets--but held steady in Richmond, Va., and  Charleston, W.Va. Commercial sales activity was at a standstill in Baltimore, Richmond, Columbia and Charleston, S.C.,  although bargain hunters with cash were active in the northern Virginia and Norfolk markets. Property  prices held steady or decreased slightly as limited financing and soft demand  reduced the number of sales transactions.
