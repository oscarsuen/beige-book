The Second District's economy has weakened noticeably  since the last report.  In general,  contacts in both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors report  broad-based deterioration in general business conditions in recent weeks and  most do not anticipate improvement in the months ahead.  In particular, contacts report widespread  softening in the labor market, especially in New York City.  Retail sales were sluggish in January, though  not down as sharply as in December, while consumer confidence remained near  record lows.  Tourism activity in New  York City weakened substantially in January and in early February.  Both  residential and commercial real estate markets deteriorated since the last  report, though housing markets in parts of upstate New York appeared relatively  stable.  Finally, bankers report that  refinancing stabilized demand for home mortgages but that demand for other  categories of loans declined further; they also report further tightening in  credit standards and higher delinquency rates--especially on loans to the  household sector.
Tourism activity in New York City has slowed  substantially since the last report.   Manhattan hotels report marked weakening in business thus far in 2009,  following a moderate pickup in December.   Revenues per room are reported to have fallen by a record 30 percent  from a year earlier in January and appear to be running nearly 40 percent lower  in February.  Occupancy tumbled roughly 15  percent from a year earlier in January, while average room rates fell 15  percent.  While much of the weakness  reflects softening demand, an industry contact notes that about half the  decline in occupancy rates is due to new hotels opening; the total number of  hotel rooms in Manhattan is expected to increase by roughly 7,000 (10 percent)  in 2009, or more than triple the net increase in 2008.  Broadway theaters report substantial slowing  in both revenues and attendance since the last report, in part reflecting the  closing of an unusually large number of Broadway shows (13) in January.  In the first half of February, revenues were  down nearly 20 percent from a year ago, while attendance fell by close to 25  percent; this compares with single-digit percentage declines in January and  slight increases in December.
The market for single-family homes in  and around New York City has also weakened, though market conditions were  reported to be more stable in upstate New York.   Contacts in northern New Jersey report little or no discretionary  activity in the resale market--almost all transactions are either foreclosed  properties or distress sales by owners that need to move.  In this environment, market prices are  difficult to gauge, but an industry expert estimates that they are down 15 to 20  percent from the 2007 peak, with steeper declines at the high end.  Separately, a real estate industry contact  notes a rising number of "short sales," for which the mortgage holder agrees to  accept less than the full principal balance upon the sale.
Commercial real estate markets in the District  weakened noticeably in January.  An  industry contact notes that New Jersey's office and retail markets have  deteriorated substantially in recent months.   Manhattan's office market has also slackened markedly: the vacancy rate  jumped nearly a full point in January, to 11.3 percent--up from 7.6 percent a  year ago.  Most of the increase was  concentrated in Midtown, particularly in the financial sector.  Asking rents for Class A space fell 2 percent  in January and are down more than 13 percent from a year ago, though an  industry contact notes that this understates the weakness because rents are  increasingly negotiable and landlords are offering more concessions.  There has been virtually no activity in Manhattan's  office sales market.  New York City's  retail rental market has also softened, except at the low end (groceries, drug  stores, etc.).  Demand for retail space  has contracted substantially, particularly in the banking sector--until  recently, banks had been substantial users of space.  Also, the bankruptcy of a major electronics  retail chain, as well as of other retailers, has added a good deal of available  space, and landlords are concerned about the outlook for other retail chains.
In assessing overall business  conditions, manufacturers and other firms report widespread deterioration in  general business conditions in February and flat to declining selling prices.  Moreover, a large majority of respondents do  not anticipate any noticeable improvement in conditions in the next six  months.  New York State reports a sharp  decline in personal income tax revenues in January, compared with a year  earlier, evidently reflecting sharp declines in bonus income in the financial  sector.
A trucking-industry contact reports  that shipping volume fell sharply in December, dropping roughly 15 percent from  a year earlier; this followed a modest uptick in November, when the 12-month  decline was under 10 percent.  With the ongoing  weakness in trucking, and given that the first quarter is typically a slow  season anyway, layoffs have been widespread, and a glut of used trucks (especially  tractor-trailers) for sale has developed.   Truckers have seen some relief from diesel prices, which have fallen  even more precipitously than regular gas prices recently.
