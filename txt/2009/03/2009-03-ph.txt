Business conditions in the Third  District remained weak in February. Manufacturers, on balance, reported  declines in shipments and new orders. Retailers indicated that sales were  nearly steady but below the level of a year ago. Motor vehicle dealers reported  continued declines in sales. Bank loan volume has risen very slightly in recent  weeks, but credit quality has continued to deteriorate. Residential real estate  sales and construction remained low but appeared to be close to steady.  Commercial real estate investment and construction activity have been moving  down. Service-sector activity has generally declined in recent weeks. Business  firms in the region reported decreases in most input costs and output prices in  February.
The outlook among  Third District businesses is generally not bright, although there has been some  improvement since the last Beige Book. Manufacturers forecast increases in  shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers expect sales to  remain slow while consumers remain concerned about job security. Auto dealers  see no indications of improvement in sales. Bankers expect lending to move up  slowly during the year. Residential real estate agents and home builders expect  sales to remain slow through most of the year. Contacts in commercial real  estate expect leasing and purchase activity to fall further this year, and they  expect vacancies to rise. Service-sector firms expect activity to be slow  through most of the year.
Despite poor  current conditions, the outlook among Third District manufacturers has improved  since the last Beige Book.Â  Among firms  polled in February, nearly one-half expect new orders and shipments to increase  during the next six months, and one-quarter expect decreases. However, capital  spending among area manufacturers is being reduced, on balance, as the number  of firms planning to cut outlays for new plant and equipment continues to  exceed the number planning increases.
Third District auto dealers  reported further slowing in sales in February. Demand has fallen for all makes  and models. Dealers said the availability of financing for car purchases  continued to limit sales, as well. Dealers also reported continued difficulty  in obtaining inventory financing. Looking ahead, dealers see no signs of an  upturn, and they expect the financial difficulties of domestic manufacturers to  negatively affect demand for those companies' vehicles and the business  operations of dealers selling them.
Commercial real estate  firms indicated that construction, leasing, and purchase activity have remained  on a downward trend since the last Beige Book. Contacts said a sharp reduction  in financing for commercial real estate has put commercial properties of all  types under downward price pressure, and that falling employment has reduced  the demand for space, resulting in declining rents. Contacts expect commercial  real estate investment and construction activity to remain weak through the  year, and they expect vacancy rates to rise and rents to decline until overall  economic conditions begin to improve.
Firms in a wide  range of industries reported they were implementing salary freezes or  reductions and cutting back on fringe benefits, including 401-K matching  contributions. A growing number of employers in the region have announced  hiring freezes as well as immediate and prospective layoffs. Several firms that  reported they intended to maintain staffing levels noted that they were  reducing hours, imposing unpaid furloughs, or scheduling temporary plant  shutdowns in order to reduce wage bills.
