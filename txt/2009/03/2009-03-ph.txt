Business conditions in the Third  District remained weak in February. Manufacturers, on balance, reported  declines in shipments and new orders. Retailers indicated that sales were  nearly steady but below the level of a year ago. Motor vehicle dealers reported  continued declines in sales. Bank loan volume has risen very slightly in recent  weeks, but credit quality has continued to deteriorate. Residential real estate  sales and construction remained low but appeared to be close to steady.  Commercial real estate investment and construction activity have been moving  down. Service-sector activity has generally declined in recent weeks. Business  firms in the region reported decreases in most input costs and output prices in  February.
The outlook among  Third District businesses is generally not bright, although there has been some  improvement since the last Beige Book. Manufacturers forecast increases in  shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers expect sales to  remain slow while consumers remain concerned about job security. Auto dealers  see no indications of improvement in sales. Bankers expect lending to move up  slowly during the year. Residential real estate agents and home builders expect  sales to remain slow through most of the year. Contacts in commercial real  estate expect leasing and purchase activity to fall further this year, and they  expect vacancies to rise. Service-sector firms expect activity to be slow  through most of the year.
Third District  manufacturers reported continuing declines in shipments and new orders, on  balance, from January to February. Around one-half of the manufacturers  surveyed noted decreases in those measures, and around one-fifth reported  increases. The balance of negative over positive reports increased from January  to February.  However, much of the recent  worsening in the region's manufacturing sector has been among producers of  primary metals and electrical equipment. Demand for industrial equipment and materials  has been especially weak because, as one manufacturing contact said, "customer  purchasing for capital projects is on hold." In contrast, demand has increased  for food products, chemicals, some finished products, and testing and measuring  instruments.
Despite poor  current conditions, the outlook among Third District manufacturers has improved  since the last Beige Book.  Among firms  polled in February, nearly one-half expect new orders and shipments to increase  during the next six months, and one-quarter expect decreases. However, capital  spending among area manufacturers is being reduced, on balance, as the number  of firms planning to cut outlays for new plant and equipment continues to  exceed the number planning increases.
Third District retailers generally  reported nearly steady sales during February, although the year-to-year  comparison remained negative for most. Merchants said sales of basic apparel  and household items have been steady or rising, but sales of most other lines  of merchandise have been weak. Reflecting the comments of most area retailers,  one store executive said, "The consumer is focused on the basics, and sales of  big ticket items are still falling."   Merchants indicated that sales of big ticket appliance and electronics items  and jewelry have been falling steeply. In contrast, sales of some apparel items  were up. The outlook among the region's retailers is not positive, but some  contacts believe consumer spending could gather strength if employment  conditions show signs of stabilizing.
Third District auto dealers  reported further slowing in sales in February. Demand has fallen for all makes  and models. Dealers said the availability of financing for car purchases  continued to limit sales, as well. Dealers also reported continued difficulty  in obtaining inventory financing. Looking ahead, dealers see no signs of an  upturn, and they expect the financial difficulties of domestic manufacturers to  negatively affect demand for those companies' vehicles and the business  operations of dealers selling them.
Total outstanding  loan volume at Third District banks has edged up slowly in recent weeks,  according to bankers contacted for this report. The gain has been mostly the  result of modest growth in commercial and industrial lending. Residential real  estate loan volume outstanding has been practically flat, and consumer loan  volume has declined. Commercial bank lending officers attributed the slowness  in lending to falling demand for credit. "The weakness in lending is on the  demand side," one banker noted, and another said, "The news coverage has the  public convinced the banks aren't lending, but we're looking for business."  However, other bankers said that an ongoing process of consolidation among  large banks with branches in the region continued to divert those institutions  from major loan marketing efforts. Several contacts also noted that lending and  investing by financial companies other than banks have been limited, especially  in certain sectors, such as construction, real estate, and retail trade. Most  of the banks contacted for this report said that credit quality continued to  decline for all categories of credit. Looking ahead, bankers expect slow  expansion in lending this year, and they are becoming increasingly concerned  that a prolonged economic slowdown will result in further weakening in the  creditworthiness of both business and individual borrowers.
Residential real estate activity in the Third  District remained weak in February. Residential real estate agents and builders  reported that sales have been nearly steady, but at a very slow pace. One  builder said that "sales have been anemic," and another said the rate has been  "the lowest we have ever seen." Inventories of both new and existing homes for  sale have been practically unchanged since the beginning of the year. Builders  continued to offer substantial incentives to purchasers, but real estate agents  said an increasing number of sellers of existing homes have preferred to offer  them for rent rather than accept low offers. Builders and agents expect sales  to remain slow through most of this year, although some said that government  programs to stimulate home buying could provide a lift to sales.
Commercial real estate  firms indicated that construction, leasing, and purchase activity have remained  on a downward trend since the last Beige Book. Contacts said a sharp reduction  in financing for commercial real estate has put commercial properties of all  types under downward price pressure, and that falling employment has reduced  the demand for space, resulting in declining rents. Contacts expect commercial  real estate investment and construction activity to remain weak through the  year, and they expect vacancy rates to rise and rents to decline until overall  economic conditions begin to improve.
Service-sector firms generally reported a drop in  activity since the last Beige Book. Business and professional services firms  indicated that the reduction in activity has prompted layoffs and other  cost-cutting measures. Firms providing services to the construction, real  estate, and finance sectors reported particularly sharp pullbacks in demand.  One such firm said that "we are living hand to mouth" and trimming every  possible budget item. Many of the region's educational institutions have also  been limiting expenditures. Endowment values have declined for most, and some  have seen reductions in applications and enrollments. The outlook among area  service firms remains negative, and several contacts say they have pushed out  their expectations for a rebound to later in the year or into next year.
Reports on input  costs and output prices largely reflect further declines since the last Beige  Book. Manufacturing firms continued to note decreases in prices for most of the  materials they use. Most also reported reducing their own prices, although food  processors have raised prices recently. Retailers have reduced prices for some  apparel and many large appliances and furniture, mainly in an effort to work  down inventories in preparation for new spring merchandise. Prices of other  goods were said to be mostly steady.
Firms in a wide  range of industries reported they were implementing salary freezes or  reductions and cutting back on fringe benefits, including 401-K matching  contributions. A growing number of employers in the region have announced  hiring freezes as well as immediate and prospective layoffs. Several firms that  reported they intended to maintain staffing levels noted that they were  reducing hours, imposing unpaid furloughs, or scheduling temporary plant  shutdowns in order to reduce wage bills.
