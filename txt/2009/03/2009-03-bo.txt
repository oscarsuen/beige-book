Retailers continue to manage  inventory levels tightly and have cut 2009 capital spending plans, although a  few say they are taking advantage of expansion opportunities. Most respondents  have invoked hiring freezes and some have already reduced or are considering  reducing headcount in the near future. Several contacts have also frozen wages  or eliminated bonuses or retirement contributions, and note that employees have  taken the news of these freezes and job cuts "remarkably well."
Overall, First District  retailers are watchful, as they expect consumers to continue to be cautious for  the next several quarters.
Many manufacturers mention  that various commodity prices have fallen, but in general these decreases have  not been fully reflected in the cost of materials or purchased services.  Manufacturers' selling prices are under  downward pressure, prompting some to offer selected reductions.  On the whole, however, respondents express  reluctance to implement broad price cuts--either out of a concern for margins or  because they estimate that customer response would be limited under current  circumstances. Biopharmaceutical firms are implementing price increases averaging  in the single digits.
About one-half of the  contacted firms have cut domestic employment and/or hours in the past three  months.  Apart from planned growth in the  biotech industry, most contacts expect to keep their U.S. headcounts stable in  2009.  About one-third of responding  manufacturers have cut employee pay rates.   Most of the remaining firms expect to increase pay in the range of 3  percent to 4 percent this year.
Domestic capital spending  plans for 2009 are mixed.  Some firms  intend to adopt labor-saving technologies or to expand their capacity,  particularly for research and development or for making high-technology  products.  Others are cutting their  capital expenditures, citing pressures to conserve cash.
Almost all of the contacted  manufacturers express caution about their revenue prospects, albeit to varying  degrees.  Some firms anticipate that  their sales will be depressed throughout 2009; reasons include falling  automotive production and consumers "battening down the hatches."  Others are hoping for an improved economic  environment by the second half of the year, or expect their own company to fare  relatively well despite economic headwinds. Some respondents indicate that  their strong cash position will provide some buffer against financial stresses  in the year ahead.
Several contacts  say they believe the New England employment picture is slightly better than the  national average, and one notes an increased willingness by candidates,  particularly those working in the Midwest's automotive industry, to relocate to  New England.  While a few respondents  cite a slight uptick in activity in February, all are concerned about the  uncertainty of the economy and many anticipate several months before a recovery  occurs.
In Providence, the downtown office  market is described as stable, but sublease supply is up and downward pressure  on rents is mounting. Some retail closings were reported in Providence, and the  industrial market is "drifting lower, but not in big trouble yet." No major  changes are reported for Hartford, but deal volume is close to zero for both  leasing and sales. Office vacancy increased "marginally", but sublease supply has  doubled since December 2008. Retail vacancy has risen in the area, but not by  as much as this contact predicted earlier in the year.
The credit  situation is described as largely unchanged since last report. Financing  continues to flow to deals under $10M but remains scarce for deals above that  threshold and virtually non-existent for deals over $50M. The financing for the  smaller deals is coming from community and regional banks around the region  with healthy balance sheets. One Boston contact expects an increase in defaults  on large commercial properties as risky loans come to maturity in the next 12  months; he says borrowers will be unable to refinance these large deals unless  investors return to the securitization market.
Contacts expect  further deterioration in the commercial market in the coming months due to  ongoing weakness in the economy and ongoing disturbances in credit markets.
Condo  sales dropped more than 25 percent year-over-year in Rhode Island and  Connecticut in December and in Massachusetts in January.  While home prices saw large declines  throughout 2008, condo price declines were much more modest until  recently.  In the New England states for  which they are reported, median condo prices fell 10 percent to 26 percent  year-over-year in December or January.
Contacts  are generally optimistic regarding the tax credit included in the stimulus  package.  Even though the new $8,000  credit is still available only for new homebuyers, they are pleased that  Congress removed the payback requirement that was part of the 2008 $7,500  credit.
