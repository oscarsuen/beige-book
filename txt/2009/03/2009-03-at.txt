Sixth District  economic activity weakened further in January and early February compared with  late 2008. Most retail contacts reported that consumer spending declined more  than expected. Residential real estate contacts noted that sales continued to  slide, although at a more modest pace than last reported. Residential  construction levels remained at very low levels. The outlook among commercial  real estate contacts worsened as vacancy rates continued to rise. Manufacturing  contacts noted further reductions in orders and production. By most accounts,  business and consumer access to credit remained tight and loan demand was  generally weak. Labor market conditions worsened as more businesses reported  cutbacks in hours and layoffs. Price pressures remained subdued throughout the District.
Commercial real estate  reports were decidedly more negative than previously reported. Vacancy rates  continued to rise in many parts of the District and this was putting downward  pressure on rents, most notably in the retail sector. Most District commercial  contractors reported declines in activity, with more projects postponed or  cancelled. Going forward, commercial real estate contacts anticipate that more  space will become vacant in coming months and that construction will slow  significantly.
District  transportation contacts reported that January and early February were very  weak. Several trucking contacts servicing retail and building product  industries reported a considerable drop in tonnage and lower revenues. Regional  rail activity was also down compared with a year earlier, with continued  declines in shipments of autos, chemicals, and construction-related items.
Most  District contacts reported a continuation of lower input costs. Manufacturers  and construction firms reported that prices paid for both raw materials and  finished goods declined further over the past two months and are expected to  remain soft in the near term.  Several  manufacturing contacts noted that final goods prices were relatively stable in  January following cuts to prices made late last year.
Most of the District received much  needed rainfall in January.  However some  areas in Alabama and Florida continued to report poor soil moisture conditions.  The Districts' poultry and cotton producing industries continued to be affected  by lower global demand. The recent salmonella outbreak had a significantly  negative effect on the local peanut industry, and the severe drop in  consumption and uncertain outlook threatens the economies of several rural  communities where major production facilities are located.
