Sixth District  economic activity weakened further in January and early February compared with  late 2008. Most retail contacts reported that consumer spending declined more  than expected. Residential real estate contacts noted that sales continued to  slide, although at a more modest pace than last reported. Residential  construction levels remained at very low levels. The outlook among commercial  real estate contacts worsened as vacancy rates continued to rise. Manufacturing  contacts noted further reductions in orders and production. By most accounts,  business and consumer access to credit remained tight and loan demand was  generally weak. Labor market conditions worsened as more businesses reported  cutbacks in hours and layoffs. Price pressures remained subdued throughout the District.
Retail activity remained  weak. District contacts reported that sales and store traffic for January and  February were disappointing and expectations were lowered for the coming  months. Several retail chains reported closing underperforming stores. Auto  dealers reported dismal January sales for both domestic and foreign makes.  Inventories of District assembled vehicles continued to climb.
Tourism activity slowed in  most parts of the District. Despite increased price discounting and promotional  activity at various attractions, the overall number of tourists visiting  Florida fell early in the year compared with late 2008 levels. Reports from New  Orleans indicated that hotel occupancy rates for Mardi Gras were on par with  2008 levels.
Reports  from homebuilders and Realtors indicated that new and existing home sales  remained weak during January and early February.  However, sales declines measured  year-over-year moderated slightly. Some contacts noted a pickup in traffic,  with potential buyers mostly interested in finding deeply discounted homes.  Existing home inventories generally rose above year-earlier levels, while new  home inventories were slightly below year-earlier levels. Housing starts  remained very weak, and the outlook among builders continued to be  pessimistic.  However, the uptick in  traffic led most Realtors to be cautiously optimistic that sales were  approaching a bottom.
Commercial real estate  reports were decidedly more negative than previously reported. Vacancy rates  continued to rise in many parts of the District and this was putting downward  pressure on rents, most notably in the retail sector. Most District commercial  contractors reported declines in activity, with more projects postponed or  cancelled. Going forward, commercial real estate contacts anticipate that more  space will become vacant in coming months and that construction will slow  significantly.
A majority of  District manufacturing contacts noted further declines in production levels and  new orders compared with a year earlier. The number of export orders continued  to fall, and most contacts reported that inventory levels decreased as well.  Contacts remained generally pessimistic about near-term production, employment,  and price levels amid severe contractions in demand.
District  transportation contacts reported that January and early February were very  weak. Several trucking contacts servicing retail and building product  industries reported a considerable drop in tonnage and lower revenues. Regional  rail activity was also down compared with a year earlier, with continued  declines in shipments of autos, chemicals, and construction-related items.
Most District banking  contacts reported that access to credit remained tight for both consumers and  small businesses for the first two months of 2009, although money was available  to customers who met stricter credit standards.   Some contacts reported that job insecurity was having a negative effect  on loan demand, with potential borrowers feeling uneasy about taking on  additional debt.
Labor market conditions remained bleak for the District in January and  February. Business contacts continued to note reduced hours and layoffs across  most industries.
Most  District contacts reported a continuation of lower input costs. Manufacturers  and construction firms reported that prices paid for both raw materials and  finished goods declined further over the past two months and are expected to  remain soft in the near term.  Several  manufacturing contacts noted that final goods prices were relatively stable in  January following cuts to prices made late last year.
Energy industry contracts confirmed that  regional fuel stocks were well above their typical winter levels, even as  refineries scaled back operations and underwent seasonal retooling.
Most of the District received much  needed rainfall in January.  However some  areas in Alabama and Florida continued to report poor soil moisture conditions.  The Districts' poultry and cotton producing industries continued to be affected  by lower global demand. The recent salmonella outbreak had a significantly  negative effect on the local peanut industry, and the severe drop in  consumption and uncertain outlook threatens the economies of several rural  communities where major production facilities are located.
