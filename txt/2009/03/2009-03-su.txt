Reports  from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic  conditions deteriorated further during the reporting period of January through  late February.  Ten of the twelve reports  indicated weaker conditions or declines in economic activity; the exceptions  were Philadelphia  and Chicago,  which reported that their regional economies "remained weak."  The deterioration was broad based, with only  a few sectors such as basic food production and pharmaceuticals appearing to be  exceptions.  Looking ahead, contacts from  various Districts rate the prospects for near-term improvement in economic  conditions as poor, with a significant pickup not expected before late 2009 or  early 2010.
Consumer spending remained sluggish on  net, although many Districts noted some improvement in January and February  compared with a dismal holiday spending season.   Travel and tourist activity fell noticeably in key destinations, as did  activity for a wide range of nonfinancial services, with substantial job cuts  noted in many instances.  Reports on  manufacturing activity suggested steep declines in activity in some sectors and  pronounced declines overall.  Conditions  weakened somewhat for agricultural producers and substantially for extractors  of natural resources, with reduced global demand cited as an underlying  determinant in both cases.  Markets for  residential real estate remained largely stagnant, with only minimal and  scattered signs of stabilization emerging in some areas, while demand for  commercial real estate weakened significantly.  Reports from banks and other financial  institutions indicated further drops in business loan demand, a slight deterioration  in credit quality for businesses and households, and continued tight credit  availability.
Upward price pressures continued to  ease across a broad spectrum of final goods and services.  This was largely associated with lower prices  for energy and assorted raw materials compared with earlier periods, but also with  weak final demand more generally, which spurred price discounting for items  other than energy and food.  With rising layoffs  and hiring freezes, unemployment has risen in all areas, reducing or  eliminating upward wage pressures.  A  number of reports pointed to outright reductions in hourly compensation costs,  through wage reductions and reduction or elimination of some employment  benefits.
The weakness in discretionary spending was also reflected in  relative sales by product type.  Sales of  luxury goods such as jewelry, electronic equipment, and other big ticket items  were reported to be especially slow in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago Districts.  Demand for furniture, appliances, and other  durable household items remained quite depressed, according to Kansas City and San Francisco.  Sales of new automobiles and light trucks  remained exceptionally sluggish, with Philadelphia,  Richmond, and Kansas City reporting  further declines from an already slow pace of sales.  Used vehicles fared better in general, with Kansas City and San Francisco noting that  they were selling well and Cleveland  and Chicago  reporting improvement over the previous period.   Reports of gains in retail spending were largely limited to grocery  stores and pharmacies, although reports from Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Richmond indicated some pickup in sales of  apparel, which the latter District attributed in part to severe winter weather.
Travel and tourist activity  continued to fall in most areas, as households reduced their vacation travel  and corporate travel spending was scaled back.   Tourist visits and spending were reported to be slower than in the  previous reporting period or down from twelve months earlier for major tourist  destinations in the Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, New York, and San Francisco  Districts, with the declines in the latter two characterized as "substantial"  and "sharp," respectively.  Airline  traffic fell in the Kansas City,  Dallas, and San  Francisco Districts.  Business at restaurants  dropped substantially in some areas, notably in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts, with  extensive layoffs and restaurant closures reported in the latter.
Manufacturing of biotechnology products and pharmaceuticals was one  bright spot, with Boston  reporting sales gains at a double-digit pace for biopharmaceutical firms, Richmond noting continued  hiring of temporary staff among life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, and  Chicago  reporting continued strong demand for pharmaceuticals.  Aircraft manufacturers in the St. Louis  District are planning to expand existing production facilities; activity in  this sector was largely stable in the Cleveland  and San Francisco Districts, but contacts expect some slowing in the future as  airlines reduce capacity due to a slowdown in air travel.  Food processors and manufacturers of selected  chemicals also saw further increases in demand during the reporting period, according  to Philadelphia  and San Francisco.
As a result of declining production,  capacity utilization fell in most manufacturing sectors, with rates as low as 25  to 50 percent reported for some metal fabricators.  Several Districts reported that capital  spending plans were curtailed further during the reporting period, notably for  companies in the retail sector and within manufacturing, which suggests the  possibility of further reductions in orders for capital goods going forward.
Demand for commercial, industrial,  and retail space fell further during the reporting period, with some evidence  of more rapid deterioration than in preceding periods.  Vacancy rates rose and lease rates declined on  a widespread basis; New York noted that commercial real estate markets  "weakened noticeably," while Atlanta described reports on commercial real  estate that were "decidedly more negative" than in previous periods.  Construction activity has declined  commensurately, and assorted reports suggest that market participants expect  this weakness to continue at least through the end of 2009.  Cleveland  noted that public works projects have shown stability of late, although they  declined in the San Francisco District as a result of the budgetary struggles  of some state and local governments there.  Credit constraints and uncertainty were  reported to be a drag on commercial construction and leasing activity in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.
The availability of credit generally remained tight.  Lenders continued to impose strict standards  for all types of loans, with scattered reports of further tightening and  particular scrutiny focused on construction projects and commercial real estate  transactions.  Despite stringent  standards, Atlanta  and Chicago  noted that funds were available for well-qualified applicants, and Dallas cited contacts who  reported that capital has become more readily available.  Credit quality fell for all loan categories,  with declines cited by most Districts with the notable exception of Kansas  City, where current loan quality was unchanged and expectations for future  quality improved modestly.  New York reported that  the deterioration in quality was most pronounced for consumer loans, while Chicago emphasized  deterioration in the quality of business loans as a result of rising  bankruptcies.  Scattered reports  suggested improved liquidity in some credit markets and reductions in interest  spreads, with Chicago  noting that conditions for the commercial paper and corporate bond markets  "improved significantly."
Activity slowed significantly for producers  of natural resource products.  Reduced  global demand and lower prices for oil have prompted a sharp cutback in oil  extraction activity since last fall, with Dallas  noting an "unprecedented" decline in the domestic rig count that was largely  concentrated in their District.   Respondents from the Kansas City District expect oil extraction activity  to fall further as the year proceeds, and Minneapolis  noted that natural gas and mining activities also faltered during the reporting  period.
Upward wage pressures eased in all  Districts, as a rising incidence of hiring freezes and continued job cuts  increased the degree of labor market slack.   Contacts from various Districts pointed to a higher incidence of wage  freezes resulting from the added slack, with a few noting outright wage reductions.  Some employers also reduced compensation by lowering  benefit costs, including reduced contributions to employee retirement programs,  according to the Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco  Districts.
