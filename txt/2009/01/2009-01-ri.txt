Activity at District ports declined quickly in November and December. Contacts reported reduced levels of import and export containers, and a "precipitous drop" in container rates. On the import side, activity related to construction and household products--such as plywood and furniture--remained notably low. Exports of power-generating products remained the only bright spot at one District port, while used car shipments to the Middle East and Africa were still doing well at another. Despite these instances, contacts reported seeing some scaling back of shipping schedules.
Commercial real estate conditions continued to deteriorate in recent weeks. Assessments of leasing activity across the Fifth District ranged from slowing to "frozen." Contacts stressed that transactions were taking longer to close due to client indecision and difficult financing conditions. A Roanoke, Va., agent reported that "the few deals that are closing are all taking longer than 180 days to complete, when they usually take 90 to 180 days." Quoted rental rates were mostly unchanged, although agents in Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Va., believed that rates would be declining if transactions were actually occurring. Vacancy rates crept up across Virginia and the Washington area, but held steady in other District markets. Little sales activity and virtually no new construction were reported. Contacts said that some banks were still financing projects, but with stronger constraints, including higher equity requirements and a greater percentage of pre-leased spaced.
