Economic conditions in the Eleventh District continued to weaken from mid-November to year-end 2008.  Contacts across a broad range of industries noted reduced demand and uncertainty about the outlook.  Manufacturing, commercial construction, energy and transportation services generally reported the largest drop in demand while residential construction remains at low levels.  Accounting and legal services seemed to hold up the best although they reported that demand was flat to slightly down.  Bank lending declined due to tighter credit and weaker loan demand.  Most respondents don't expect conditions to improve until the second half of 2009 with a growing number of respondents now looking at early 2010.
Light sweet crude oil fell to $37 per barrel by year-end, the lowest price since 2004, from $55 per barrel in mid-November.  Contacts said a huge over-supply of crude oil driven by the US and global slowdown led to the decline and that consecutive cuts by OPEC were not sufficient to stem the decline.  Oil product prices fell as fast as crude oil, leaving refiner margins weak.  On-highway prices for both gasoline and diesel fell by about 50 cents per gallon since the last survey and natural gas prices declined by about a $1 per Mcf from $6.50 per Mcf in mid-November.
Construction-related manufacturers reported continued declines in shipments and orders even after adjusting for normal seasonal reductions.  Most producers reported reductions in jobs and expect further cuts in early 2009.  Some contacts noted that the recent plunge in commodity prices provided only slight relief in the cost of production since capital costs per unit of output have increased as capacity utilization has declined and because pricing on rail and truck transportation and coal have not fallen due to long-term contracts.  Contacts continue to report that demand from commercial construction is shrinking rapidly with the main exception being government sponsored projects.  Contacts reported that the outlook has gotten worse and most do not expect a turnaround until late 2009.
Most respondents in high-tech manufacturing industries report that demand has fallen moderately since the last survey.  Weakness was widespread across global markets and products.  Most firms said that they were planning to reduce employment over the next several months.  Respondents reported lean inventories, although one respondent said the recent reduction in demand from Asia had caught them off guard and that they were working aggressively to reduce inventories.  While one respondent noted that their factories were running at only 40 to 45 percent of capacity, another respondent said that the current downturn is not nearly as bad as the high-tech recession in 2001. Most respondents expect some improvement in demand sometime in the second half of 2009.
Paper manufacturers reported continued declines in production and orders.  Demand for corrugated paper used for boxes and packing material has fallen sharply.  Contacts noted that this is a reflection of the overall weakness in manufacturing as producers of a wide range of products are shipping less output.  Noted exceptions to the weakness are food processors, where contacts suggest that their industry remains recession-proof.
Respondents reported that while margins for gasoline were particularly weak, refinery capacity utilization held steady at about 85 percent.  Respondents in petrochemicals and derivative plastics said that demand and prices have fallen sharply since the last survey. The decline in demand stemmed from declines in domestic housing, autos, and general manufacturing activity, as well as export markets.  At least 10 large plants have shutdown on the Gulf Coast in recent weeks, and others have cut runs.  Layoffs have been widespread among firms and their contractors.
Auto dealers report that sales and traffic continue to fall from already depressed levels.  While domestic brands have been hit the hardest, contacts report that recent declines have been broad-based across all vehicle brands.  Respondents report that manufacturer incentives are ample but that they are not having as much impact as in the past.  One respondent said that in order to reduce his inventory, he likely will not order any new vehicles until February.  A bright spot is used car sales and repair services which have increased slightly since the last survey.   Most contacts expected very weak new vehicle sales at least though the first half of 2009.   Contacts are hoping for some improvement in the second half of the year but are cautious since the outlook remains very uncertain.
Accounting and legal firms report that activity was flat to slightly down since the last survey and that receivables are getting slower and harder to collect.  Legal firms reported new real estate projects have dropped off sharply and that many projects are being put on hold for an indefinite period of time.  International business has also declined.  Offsetting this has been an increase in litigation and bankruptcy services.
Airlines report that demand continues to weaken and that it is likely to continue to fall over the next six months.  Respondents in container cargo and intermodal trade report a sharp drop off in activity since the last survey due to declines in international trade volumes.  Intermodal transport services also noted a decline in demand.  Shipping companies reported that the largest declines in volumes have been to retailers although consumer shipments have also weakened.
District respondents said apartment demand fell over the survey period.  New construction added units at the same time move-outs increased, leading to increases in vacancy rates.  Commercial real estate transactions--both leasing and investment--have ground to a halt.  Contacts reported "nothing is going on".  Outlooks remain uncertain, although one contact noted scattered signs of optimism, with people talking of possible opportunities in 2009.
Depository institutions report maintaining tight credit standards, and most report generally stable deposits.  The slowdown in loan demand has been broad-based.  Demand has decreased for mortgages and consumer loans, particularly auto loans and credit card issuance and purchase volume.  Real estate lenders are very concerned about 2009 while other lenders expect either flat or very modest growth.
