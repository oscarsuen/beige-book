Conditions in the commercial office market remained exceptionally weak, with demand for new and existing space reportedly held down by credit market constraints and uncertainty among potential tenants regarding future business conditions.  Construction activity was very limited, except for specialty projects such as hospitals and government facilities. Financial Institutions District banking contacts reported that loan demand remained very soft.  Commercial and industrial loan volumes were at very low levels, as few businesses sought to expand production capacity or inventories.  Credit quality deteriorated further, and the availability of credit remains quite constrained, with contacts reporting that some banks have withdrawn from entire lending lines.  The sole bright spot was an increase in mortgage applications, especially for refinancing conforming home loans, which was spurred by the recent drops in interest rates on such loans.
