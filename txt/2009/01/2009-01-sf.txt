Economic activity in the Twelfth District weakened on net during the survey period of December through the beginning of January.  Upward price pressures continued to ease overall, largely as a result of declines in the prices of energy and some commodities, and upward wage pressures have largely disappeared.  Holiday season retail sales were very sluggish, and demand for services continued to soften.  Manufacturing activity dropped significantly on net.  Demand for agricultural products generally remained stable, but conditions weakened further for oil extractors.  Conditions remained feeble in District housing markets, and demand for commercial real estate continued to fall.  Contacts from financial institutions reported very weak loan demand and tight credit availability.
Contacts reported little or no upward pressure on wages.  With unemployment rising in most areas, companies have seen an increase in the quantity and quality of applicants for open positions, which limits upward wage pressures.  Some contacts also reported that they are implementing or considering wage freezes, which employees appear increasingly willing to accept.  Wage gains continued to slow for worker groups that previously had seen rapid growth, notably those skilled in the use of advanced technologies.
Demand for services fell further compared with the previous survey period.  Providers of health-care services reported continued declines in activity.  For providers of professional services such as advertising, legal services, accounting, and business consulting, demand continued to fall, and contacts noted concerns regarding the ability of clients to pay.  Travel activity declined further:  contacts from Southern California reported that much weaker demand for hotel rooms has followed recent supply expansions that had heightened the competition for bookings; in Hawaii, tourist visits and spending were down by double-digit amounts relative to 12 months earlier, and hotels and related businesses have been laying off staff.
