Economic conditions in the Sixth District were weak through December.  Holiday sales results were near or below year-ago levels and auto sales were dismal.  Further declines in new orders were reported by most manufacturing contacts.  Residential real estate contacts described new and existing home sales and construction activity as weak and that average home prices continued to decline in most areas.  Commercial contractors also noted ongoing softness in nonresidential construction.  Lending standards at District banks remained tight.  Labor markets weakened further through the end of the year with contacts across most industries noting additional layoffs and reduced hours.  A majority of business contacts reported reduced input prices.
District vehicle sales were off sharply in November and December.  Contacts cited both tight consumer credit and overall lower demand as contributing to the weakness.  Dealers across the region are reportedly cutting advertising and payrolls to cope with the current business climate.
Tourism activity was mixed from mid-November through the holiday season.  Florida appeared to benefit from the usual influx of winter residents, but contacts report that overall visits to the state were below year-ago levels.  Nonetheless, aggressive promotions and cheaper gasoline prices appeared to boost travel in to several Florida destinations.
Most District commercial contractors continued to report declines in activity, and more projects were cancelled or postponed.  Going forward, commercial real estate contacts anticipate more space will become available and rents will soften, particularly in the retail sector.
Most transportation service firms reported weak freight demand and excess shipping capacity in November and December.  Shipments of retail, automotive, and construction-related goods, as well as inter-modal cargoes were reported down sharply from a year earlier, with only coal and minerals posting small gains.
Most District contacts reported reduced input price pressures.  Manufacturers reported that prices for both raw materials and finished goods were below year-ago levels and are expected to decline further in the short term.  Even as input price pressures have eased, some businesses noted falling profit margins because of the need to discount output prices.
According to contacts, oil and gas exploration companies scaled back operations and re-evaluated expansion plans in response to lower oil prices and difficulty obtaining financing.
