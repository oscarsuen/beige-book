The economy of the Eleventh District continues to advance, according   to the Directors and businessmen surveyed, but the Teamsters' strike   is beginning to disrupt business activity. Consumer spending remains   strong with both department stores and auto dealers reporting recent   gains in sales volume. Bank loans outstanding continue to grow at   the same reduced rate that has prevailed since the start of the   year. Mortgage lending activity by savings and loan associations is   down substantially from last year's peak and appears to be slowing   further. New orders and capacity utilization remain high in most   manufacturing industries. There is a noticeable rise of resentment   about inflation, and the Government's inability to handle the   problem effectively.
The Teamsters' strike forced the temporary closing of a local GM   assembly plant due to a lack of parts. Other manufacturers are   watching the situation closely and indicate a prolonged strike would   be harmful. The strike has not appreciably affected the movement of   goods at the port of Houston, although some merchandise that would   normally leave the port is being warehoused.
Department store sales continue to increase and remain slightly   above last year's Easter sales period. Early spring sales promotions   are helping to boost sales volumes. Many executives anticipate a   slowing of sales in the second half of the year but add signs of a   widespread slowdown are not yet evident. Inventories remain near   desired levels.
Auto sales continue to make a strong showing. Gains largely reflect   the increased popularity of economy-size cars, although one dealer   notes that sales of big cars are picking up again. Inventories of   trucks and small cars are low.
Loans outstanding at District banks continued to climb at the   somewhat slower pace established earlier this year, but loan   commitments appear to have risen sharply in March. Much of the   strength in lending is centered in energy-related activities.   Consumer lending appears to have quickened recently. Most types of   real estate lending also remain strong, although some weakness in   mortgage warehousing is noted. Deposits are showing essentially no   growth.
Preliminary results from the quarterly survey of agribankers suggest   little overall change in agricultural credit conditions since the   first of the year. Many rural banks report a normal seasonal   weakness in loan demand. Banks continue to be very selective in   making loan commitments, and few are actively seeking new farm loan   accounts. One noticeable change since the last survey is an apparent   improvement in bank liquidity in the High Plains region of Texas. In   addition to normal deposit growth generated by crop sales in the   first quarter, several agribankers in that area note lending   activity by the Farmers Home Administration and the Small Business   Administration has contributed to an improvement in loan repayment   rates and to increased bank deposits.
Savings and loan associations report that mortgage lending remains   lackluster and deposit inflows are weak. Some S&Ls experienced net   deposit outflows in early April, apparently reflecting consumer cash   needs to make income tax payments. Lower interest rates on money   market certificates caused an initial reduction in the level of   those deposits, but most S&Ls report the effects have been   relatively mild.
Manufacturers report steep increases in finished goods prices.   Although increases in wage rates are moderate, the growing shortage   of skilled labor is forcing labor costs up as many firms find it   necessary to start training programs. Raw materials and   intermediate-goods prices continue to rise rapidly.
New factory orders are increasing at a moderate pace, and back   orders are heavy as capacity utilization remains high in most   industries. Although delivery times are lengthening, shortages of   materials and parts remain isolated. Increases in new orders for   machinery, textiles, and apparel continue strong. Bookings for   drilling equipment and transportation equipment remain at high   levels, but some weakness is noted among manufacturers of food   service equipment. Inventories generally remain near desired levels.
New construction plans for manufacturing plants this year are not   expected to match last year's strong increase. One area of potential   weakness is the petroleum processing industry where uncertainty over   the availability of feedstocks has cut into projected plant   expansions. However, if the production of chemicals continues to   increase as it did in the first quarter, construction in that   industry could pick up appreciably. Construction of electric   generating plants is also slower this year than last year. An   improved profit outlook for steel producers and fabricators is   expected to boost construction outlays to replace old facilities,   possibly as soon as late this year. Construction spending by the   paper industry is also expected to increase sharply.
Discussions with small groups of businessmen reveal rising   resentment against the failure of Government to deal more   effectively with inflation. The continued onrush of Government   regulation is another very sensitive issue. Declarations that they   have stopped trying to comply are heard, especially from small   businesses.
