Business activity in the Second District continued to expand   moderately in March and early April according to recent comments of   directors and other business leaders. While retail sales have been   mixed, current and prospective business sales continue to be strong.   With respect to inventories, several manufacturers mentioned that   they thought that their customers had begun to stockpile inventories   in anticipation of higher prices and the possibility of a prolonged   teamsters' strike. Although supplies of most basic and intermediate   materials seem adequate, scarcities have been reported for certain   chemicals and other products. On the financial front, there were   reports of continued liquidity pressures on small- and medium-sized   firms.
Retail sales in the Second District have been mixed in recent weeks.   Some retailers report their sales have been brisk, while others   expressed disappointment. In any event, comparisons of the sales   figures with those for a year ago are difficult because Easter   occurs several weeks later this year. The teamsters' strike was not   expected to have much effect on retail sales until late May or early   June, when goods now on order and scheduled to be delivered would be   merchandised. At some stores that reported disappointing sales,   inventories appear to be running on the high side. Indeed, one large   national retailer plans to cut back on its orders to work down its   excess stocks. The general consensus is that retail sales will   probably post a modest increase in 1979. Consumer spending on   automobiles has been quite strong over the past month, accompanied   by a pronounced shift in the sales mix. The demand for small cars,   including both foreign and domestic makes, has been brisk,   reportedly reflecting consumers increased concern with fuel economy.
Outside of retailing, business activity remains robust. Overall,   orders are brisk and capital spending is strengthening. A few clouds   do seem to be forming on the business horizon, however. Delivery   times for many goods are lengthening, and bottlenecks are developing   for a few raw and intermediate materialsâ€”e.g., chemicals, carbon   products, petroleum products, paper, and certain kinds of steel.   Similarly, the demand for producers durables equipment may also be   running up against a supply constraint. One upstate durables   manufacturer mentioned that his business was "excellent", but that   his delivery times have now stretched beyond the one-year mark. At   the same time, some business inventories seem to be growing at a   faster rate than they had been in recent months. While businesses   still assert that they are conscientiously following "cautious"   inventory-management policies, there are scattered reports of "imbalances." One large paper-products manufacturer, for example,   cited localized buildups in the Midwest and on the West Coast. Also,   several businesses mentioned that their customers appeared to be   stockpiling materials and might even be "double-ordering" goods in   order to ensure delivery. Some of these inventory imbalances may be   the result of the teamsters' strike.
Looking ahead, there is still considerable sentiment that a slowdown   is in the offing for the second half of 1979 led by a softening in   the housing and consumer sectors, although there is disagreement on   the degree of the slowing. However, one respondent suggested that a   long teamsters' strike could dampen even a sharp slowdown, as a   strike would deplete inventories and its settlement would later   produce a surge like the steel strike of 1968. In that event, in his   view the post-strike recovery would mitigate the depressive effects   of the recession.
On the financial front, there is general agreement that liquidity   pressures are increasing, but only for small- and medium-sized   firms. Indeed, many businesses reported longer collection lags for   their accounts receivable. The senior lending officers at major   Second District banks who were contacted, however, have yet to see   evidence of seriously deteriorating corporate liquidity among their   customers, who include many of the largest national firms. One   respondent cited weak corporate borrowing over the March tax date as   indicating ample liquidity. Although the recent easing in the   commercial paper market has at times widened the spread between the   prime rate and paper rates, this development was not viewed as   reducing large banks' loan demand. This is because the spread was   viewed as increasing from a level which was already high enough to   discourage utilization of short-term bank credit by most paper   issuers.
