Directors and other respondents in the First District report that   the level of economic activity remains very high. The only sign of   weakness is a slight softening in retail sales. Manufacturers   continue to experience strong orders and capacity utilization is   high. Delivery lead times are growing and price increases are   becoming larger. In the banking sector, loan demand is strong, but   regular time and savings deposits are not growing at all. This   situation is causing the smaller banks considerable concern. No one   reports any serious problems in the first week of the Teamsters   strike; however, several respondents expect to be adversely affected   around the middle of the second week.
Retail sales in the First District may be weakening slightly. The   head of a department store chain in the region believes that the   momentum has gone out of consumer purchases; it has become harder to   sell. A director associated with a large food chain reports that,   after several very dynamic months, there has been a marked softening   in the past three weeks. On the other hand, directors from northern   New England say that sales in their states remain strong. Automobile   dealers are doing particularly well.
Manufacturers in New England enjoyed a very strong March. Orders and   production were up; capacity utilization is high. The prosperity is   widespread: among the areas said to be doing well are automotive   products, both commercial and military aircraft engines and parts,   machine tools, instruments, graphics and apparel fasteners. Housing   products (windows, cabinets and various built in products) are   selling very well; however the demand for small appliances is   slightly off. All the manufacturers contacted felt that their   inventories are at appropriate levels; they are much more concerned   about continued increases in delivery lead times and higher prices.   Increases in lead times have been particularly marked for electronic   components and castings and forgings. Prices have risen especially   sharply for brass, plastics, and repairs and services. One large   manufacturer expressed the view that price increases by uncontrolled   vendors will destroy the voluntary wage-price controls.
In the banking sector loan demand is stronger than expected, while   regular time and savings deposits are not growing at all. In   northern New England this situation is forcing banks to become   restrictive in their lending. Smaller banks are worried about the   possibility that the denomination of the six-months certificates   will be lowered. In contrast to the country banks, a number of the   money center banks are reported to be marketing loans very   aggressively. This is said to be holding down interest rates;   however, the quality of the loans is also somewhat lower than it   would otherwise be. These banks are not concerned about the   availability of funds; they are willing to buy whatever they need to   make loans.
Professors Eckstein and Houthakker were available for comment this   month. Eckstein believes that the level of economic activity is very   near full capacity. His clients and his reading of current business   conditions also suggest that production and sales are still "moving   along smartly." The married male unemployment rate has struck "rock   bottom," help wanted ads abound, and the DRI indices show that labor   market conditions are "tight." The current low first quarter growth   estimates reflect the vagaries of quarterly GNP estimates, not a   sharp deceleration in business activity.
Despite high demand, the economy does not appear to be running out   of cash. At present, credit needs are modest compared to the banking   system's ability to supply funds. The slow growth of the standard   monetary aggregates is misleading in this regard. The public is   acting as though it has adequate money resources because it is   accumulating liquidity in the form of "near money" assets excluded   from the standard aggregates. For example, high interest rates have   caused a rapid expansion of money market mutual funds. To the extent   these intermediaries purchase large CDs from commercial banks, M4   would provide a better gauge of recent "money" growth than M1, M1+,   or M2. Eckstein believes that it would be a mistake to reduce the   Federal Funds rate at this time. In fact, the Fed should take steps   to tighten policy further, raising the funds rate only as a last   resort, however.
Houthakker is less optimistic than Eckstein. He believes there is a   60 percent chance of a "pause" and 40 percent chance of a recession   by year end. Like Eckstein, Houthakker believes that the standard   monetary aggregates are misleading. Considering the growth of money   market mutual funds and other money substitutes, monetary policy has   been neither too tight nor too loose. As long as the public's liquid   assets continue to grow at current rates, there is no need to change   the Federal Funds rate. Furthermore, the Fed should not change the   Funds rate to "defend the dollar." The dollar has been doing well   recently. It is more important to "defend the economy." "A   prosperous economy is the best support we can give the dollar."
Houthakker is pleased with the President's energy program. In time,   decontrol of energy prices should tend to reduce domestic prices as   our supply of oil increases and our dependence on foreign oil is   reduced. Initially, however, decontrol will increase prices. The Fed   should not repeat the mistake it made in 1974 of tightening monetary   policy too severely in response to these higher energy prices.   Houthakker suggests a "middle course:" The Fed should not adamantly   hold the line on price increases, nor should it passively permit   higher energy prices to set off ensuing rounds of inflation.
