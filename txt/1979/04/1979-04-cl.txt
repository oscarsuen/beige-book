Automotive production and employment in the Fourth District is being   hampered by the Teamsters strike, but other key manufacturing   industries are operating close to effective capacity. High operating   rates and fear of shortages have stimulated some inventory building.   Manufacturers see little sign of let-up in price pressures in the   near-term. Retailers still view short-term sales prospects   cautiously and some expect smaller gains in sales this quarter than   last. Deposit flows at S&Ls in recent weeks have slackened, and   officials are uncertain over future deposit flows and mortgage   lending.
Except for the automotive industry, the Teamsters strike has not yet   had disruptive effects on employment and production, although   sizable cutbacks are likely if the strike lasts beyond mid-April.   Auto production so far this month has been cut nearly 8 percent from   the scheduled 825,000 units. GMC has already shortened the workweek   at plants in Cincinnati and last week furloughed 7,400 workers for   one week at the Lordstown assembly plant and another 6,000 workers   at a nearby electrical equipment plant. Production losses were   reported at about 7,500 passenger cars and vans. Ford Motors expects   a cutback of about 55,000 passenger cars this month, nearly 25   percent of their planned schedule, even if the strike ends this   week. They expect that two-thirds of the production loss will be   made in May and June, but 10 percent or more will not be recovered   in this model year because of poor sales of certain models. In   addition, Chrysler announced a shutdown of six plants in Ohio   beginning April 9. However, the shutdown probably stems from excess   inventories rather than the Teamsters strike.
Nonautomotive industries, including primary metals, machine tools,   trucks, rubber and plastics and paper and paperboard, are reported   to be at high or near peak operating rates. Effects of the Teamsters   strike on employment and production in these industries have been   minimal, although steel, glass and auto components producers expect   disruptions should the strike continue much longer. Steel and   aluminum industries are operating at effective capacity. Steel is   expected to operate at about 95 percent capacity this quarter, a   presumed maximum rate, unless hindered by the Teamsters strike. A   shortage of domestic coke has boosted imports. One economist expects   some domestic steel users to step-up imports because of fear of   shortages and lengthening lead times at domestic mills. A major flat   glass supplier to GMC reports a full order book through this summer.   An axle and transmission producer also reports no cutbacks in   production have yet resulted because of the Teamsters strike and   remarked that should the auto industry be shut down, this producer   would continue at full production in order to relieve a shortage in   axles. Some softening is noted in sales of vans because of higher   fuel prices. A shortage of polyvinyl chloride has led some producers   to allocate production. Tire producers have been operating at   capacity partly because of high demand and also because of   expiration of the labor contract on April 20. An economist with a   tire producer expects that the probability of a strike in the rubber   industry will be heightened if the Teamsters strike continues   through April 20. Paperboard capacity has tightened because U.S.   producers have stepped up exports in response to higher prices   abroad than in U.S. markets.
Businesses assert they are still cautious in inventory policies but   are more willing to step up inventory building because economic   activity in the fourth quarter of 1978 and again in the last quarter   was better than some expected, which has given rise to a feeling   that the widely discussed recession is not yet apparent. An   automotive parts suppliers note that their inventories are at record   levels but in terms of day's supply, stocks at the end of last month   fell because of further increases in sales.
Intense price pressures show little sign of abatement in the near-  term, nor are they expected to let up as long as manufacturing   activity continues to operate at or near peak rates. Some officials   remarked that only recently have markets for their products been   strong enough to absorb price increases. Only scattered signs of   moderation in price pressures are indicated. For example, additional   FVC capacity is expected to be in operation within the next two to   three months, which should end allocation of that product and ease   strong upward price pressures. Also, steel scrap prices in some   regions fell recently but this was not expected to spread to all   steel producing regions.
Unlike ebullient remarks from manufacturers, retailers remain   cautious in their appraisal of consumer spending prospects. The   Easter season does not appear to have stimulated GAF sales so far   this month. A department store official notes that consumers respond   well to bargains and heavy promotions. An economist with a major   department store chain expected April sales will increase about 9 to   10 percent from a year-ago, but he expects only an 8 percent year-  over-year increase in sales this quarter compared with a 9.5 percent   increase last quarter.
S&L reports on deposit flows and consumer responses to recent   changes in money market certificates are mixed. Some feel that the   March 15 changes that set maximum rates on certificates may not have   much adverse effect on deposit flows. An economist with a FHLB in   this District perceives that associations are not strapped for   funds, at least as suggested by an increase in paybacks instead of   in new borrowings in recent weeks. On the other hand, some others   feel associations have not been successful in rollover of maturing   certificates. Nevertheless, some officials believe they can still   draw down liquidity and step up borrowing to support mortgage   demand, which is typically described as rising seasonally but not as   strong as a year-ago. Prices of new houses continue to rise rapidly,   although prices of new houses have tended to increase less rapidly   than last year, according to some lenders.
