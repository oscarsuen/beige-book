Responses to our latest survey indicate some further modest   improvement in Fifth District business activity. Gains in   manufacturing appear spotty, concentrated for the most part among   producers of hard goods. Inventory accumulation in the manufacturing   sector appears to have picked up in the past two months but remains   moderate. Pessimism in the business community appears to be less   pervasive than earlier in the year, although expectations for the   next six months are still basically negative. The inflation problem   continues to be the number one concern among businessmen. Thus far   the Easter retail rush appears to be something short of spectacular.   Loan demand at banks has picked up in recent weeks but activity in   mortgage markets has slowed.
Of manufacturers responding to our latest survey nearly one-third   report increases in shipments, new orders, and order backlogs over   the past month. Such gains appear more prevalent among producers of   primary metals, machinery and equipment, and electrical equipment   than among manufacturers at large. On the other hand, textiles and   paper producers do not seem to have shared in these recent gains.   Employment among manufacturers continues to hold steady as does the   length of the work week. Further accumulation of finished goods   inventories apparently occurred since the last survey, but, on   balance, current stocks have risen only very slightly relative to   desired levels. For the most part our directors see little   indication of significant inventory accumulation such as that which   occurred during 1974. Only two directors see any cause for concern   over current inventory developments. One cites heavy buying in   anticipation of higher prices and one views heavy accumulation at   the retail level as a seasonal development. Manufacturers seem   comfortable with current plant and equipment capacity and with   current expansion plans.
Our sources of information yield no clear picture of conditions in   the retail sector. There are signs that the normal Easter buying   spree is underway, but no indication that it has been in anyway   spectacular. Several retailers characterize current conditions only   as stable. One cites a recent pickup in sales of big ticket items.   Sources in the financial sector perceive strength in automobile   sales and also in the use of credit cards.
The pervasive pessimism of last winter appears to be dissipating in   the face of continued strength in the economy. Expectations among   our survey respondents remain basically negative, but it is clear   that a number of those respondents feel that prospects have improved   in recent weeks. Over one-third of the manufacturers still expect   the level of business activity nationally to decline over the next   six months, but fewer than one-fourth expect declines in their   respective market areas. Furthermore, over one-fourth expect further   gains in output in their own firms. Retailers, on balance, foresee   little change in the level of activity nationally, locally, or in   their individual firms. Several firms expressed concern over   specific conditions, inflation, the level of interest rates, the oil   situation, and the teamsters' strike, but the basic outlook held by   District businessmen can only be said to have improved in recent   months.
In the financial sector businesses appear to have become more active   bank borrowers and there are signs of renewed demand for installment   credit to finance purchases of automobiles. The residential mortgage   market, however, continues to reflect slowing activity. Small to   medium sized firms seeking working capital credits have contributed   to recent increases in commercial bank lending to businesses. Loan   demand has been greatest on the part of manufacturers, and strength   here has been somewhat offset by weak demand in the trade sector.   Commercial banks in the region continue to feel comfortable with   their liquidity positions, and thrift institutions have experienced   only a moderate slowing in funds inflows following recent change in   regulation governing money market certificates.
Fifth District farmers enjoyed a greater improvement in cash farm   income in 1978 than did farmers nationwide. Generally good crop   production—in contrast with the drought-reduced crop output of   1977—and higher farm prices combined to bolster total cash receipts   from farm marketings some 17 percent over year-earlier levels as   against an increase of around 15 percent nationally. Receipts from   crop marketings, up 19 percent, contributed most to the District   increase. By state, greatest improvement in total cash farm income   occurred in Virginia and the Carolinas—states hit hardest by the   1977 drought.
