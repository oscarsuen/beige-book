Our latest survey of Fifth District business conditions turns up       several signs of a softening of activity over the past few weeks.       Manufacturers report weakness in new orders and reductions in       backlogs of orders along with some further inventory accumulation.       Shipments continue at former levels, however, and inventories, in       general, remain at or near desired levels. Increases in prices other       than employee compensation have been somewhat less widespread       recently than in previous months. Credit conditions in the District       seem to reflect generally comfortable liquidity positions at       commercial banks and an overall easing in the demand for loans due       mainly to weakness in business credit demand. Demand in the consumer       and construction areas remains firm.
Manufacturers responding to this month's survey indicated little or       no change in total shipments, but noted some weakness in new orders.       Nearly one-third of the respondents noted month-to-month declines in       the volume of new orders. There was also some working down of       backlogs of orders over the month. Further accumulation of       inventories occurred during January, but the breadth of this       development was limited, particularly as to stocks of finished       goods, and concern over excessive inventories diminished somewhat.       Our survey results further suggest that there were some scattered       reductions in employment and in length of workweek during the past       few weeks. A substantial majority of all respondents continue to       view both current plant and equipment capacity and current expansion       plans as appropriate.
Despite the apparent weakening in the level of activity in recent       weeks, the broadly based pessimism we have discerned lately seems to       have diminished somewhat since our last survey. The consensus       outlook for the level of activity at the national and local levels       remains basically negative. Nonetheless, pessimism is now less       widespread than formerly and the outlook with regard to individual       firms has turned positive. On the inflation front, price increases       continue to dominate the picture but to a much lesser extent than in       other recent survey periods.
In the financial sector, commercial and industrial loans have not       been as strong as expected, even after taking normal seasonal       weakness into account. This pause in lending appears to be widely       distributed across type of industry and size of firm and also cuts       across regional lines. Bankers interpret the weakness as being due       to conservative inventory policies, especially among retailers, and       to strong fourth quarter profits. Bankers also suggest that their       customers are becoming more cautious about capital spending. Growth       of loans to individuals for personal expenditures has been robust.       There is a noticeable change in emphasis on the part of consumers       away from installment contracts and toward revolving credits, and       big ticket items are being charged on credit cards to an increasing       degree.
Construction loan demand is strong, and banks are generally willing       to continue providing funds for building projects. There is no sign       of weakness in the construction industry when viewed from the       lenders' perspective. Contacts with District S&L's, however,       indicate tighter lending terms are having a depressing effect on       residential mortgage loan demand. Nonetheless, pockets of       undiminished strength in mortgage loan demand do exist.
With a generally good crop year and higher farm product prices—especially for livestock—in 1978, farm income levels rose and the       financial position of Fifth District farmers in general improved.       With this improvement, bankers responding to our fourth quarter       survey of farm credit conditions noted that loan repayment rates       were much better than a year earlier and requests for renewals or       extensions of existing loans were down sharply. Farmers' demand for       bank credit remained fairly strong but showed less strength than a       year ago. Bank supplies of farm loan funds continued at the reduced       levels of the second and third quarters and were considerably lower       than in the fourth quarter of 1977. Bank interest rates on farm       loans rose sharply. Moreover, better than one-tenth of the       respondents, the same as in the two immediately preceding quarters,      indicated that they had been forced to refuse or reduce a farm loan       because of a shortage of funds.
