The unexpectedly strong pace of economic activity last quarter has       led some District observers to postpone the timing of a recession,       now expected to occur later this year. Retailers and producers of       consumer goods are cautious in their appraisal of near-term sale       prospects. On the other hand, manufacturers expect to operate at or       near capacity at least this quarter. S&Ls are concerned that       supplies of mortgage funds may be sharply reduced if latest deposit       experience continues. Financial prospects for the City of Cleveland       remain uncertain.
Several economists who had forecast a recession in early or mid-1979       have pushed back their expectations to late 1979 in response to the       better-than-expected pace of activity last quarter. Some raised       estimates of the level of output for the year, but still expect a       recession late in 1979. A few economists indicated unwillingness to       change their recession forecast because of uncertainty over how long       the recent sluggish behavior in monetary aggregates will last. Also,       a few others do not expect a recession this year. They point out       that consumer spending may not be as weak as perceived and that       fixed investment will likely be stronger than indicated in latest       surveys.
Retailers and producers of consumer goods are still cautious in       comments on short-term sales prospects. They explained that       department store sales in December and the fourth quarter showed       little improvement in real terms. An economist with a major national       department store chain remarked that year-over-year sales gains       amounted to about 8 percent last quarter, considerably less than       indicated in preliminary estimates of national product accounts.       Widespread markdowns and extensive sales promotions in major       metropolitan centers of the District during December are expected to       dampen sales gains in January, although retailers report sales have       been running well ahead of a year-ago, when sales were depressed by       frigid weather throughout the District. Some retailers expect       modest, if any, sales gains this quarter and have held tight control       over orders to their suppliers. An apparel producer, for example,       notes that sales to large retailers continue to run behind a year-      earlier volume. A major auto producer, which late last fall       projected total new car sales for 1979 at 11.1 million cars,       recently reduced its forecast to 10.8 million units.
Manufacturing activity in the District has been sustained by high       operating rates, at or near effective capacity, in capital goods,       primary metals, automotive products, rubber, plastics and glass       industries. Machine tool builders are operating at capacity and       expect to continue at capacity through most of this year as backlogs       are still expanding. Orders in January have apparently rebounded       from a drop in December. In steel, expectations are that the       industry will be operating at or near effective capacity this       quarter and perhaps next. Millers are generally booked this quarter       and orders for second quarter are reported to be heavy. Steel orders       from appliance producers have been sluggish but more than offset by       sizable demand from the automotive industry and increasing demand      from capital goods producers, including machinery and construction.       The January 1st increase in trigger prices for steel is not expected       to result in any meaningful reduction in steel imports until March       at the earliest. One economist attributes the unexpectedly high       level of demand to a fear of shortages and believes inventories are       being built rapidly. Another believes that a rapid buildup of steel       inventories is occurring only at the distributor level.
Retailers and manufacturers generally are still cautious over       inventory policies. Retailers of general merchandise have managed to       trim stocks through aggressive promotion last month but apparently       some still have higher than desired inventories. Stocks of major       appliances, which were trimmed by recent production cutbacks by some       large producers, have been reduced to a more normal range. According       to one producer, last quarter's adjustment reflects expectations of       little or no sales gain this year. Relatively low profit margins,       lack of growth over the next few years, the need to revamp       appliances for energy conservation, and continuous labor strife are       said to be among the reasons for an impending March 1st shutdown of       a major appliance producer in the District that employs about 7,500      workers. A few manufacturers, especially in capital goods       industries, plan to step up inventory building in response to       further increases in backlogs and rising prices. Tire producers are       finding it difficult to build inventories of radial tires because of       high demand. One cautionary note is that inventories are actually       higher than suggested in customary inventory-sales ratios because       many businesses switched from fifo to lifo. Housing demand has been       slowing, probably more than seasonally, although causes are       uncertain. One source suggests a problem that might be shaping up is       the lack of availability of mortgage funds. Some S&Ls have not been       offering money market certificates and others have a capped rate       below the maximum because of a profit squeeze. Also, S&Ls are       investing a sizable proportion of money market certificates,       especially in bank CDs. Consequently, mortgage commitments are being       held back. One of the largest S&Ls in the District reports a sizable       runoff in deposits during January, the second successive month       deposit flows have been below expectations. The association       attributed outflows to the 2-year Treasury bill they believe has        attracted interest because of the longer maturity than savings       certificates. Home builders in most parts of the District are said       to be cautious in their building plans in order to avoid repetition       of the 1972-1973 housing boom.
Cleveland's financial prospects for 1979 remain uncertain as the       campaign on a referendum to raise taxes and to sell the municipal       light and power gets underway. Recent polls show for the first time       voter approval for both the 0.5 percent tax increase and the sale of       municipal light. However, growing fears that revenues will not be       sufficient to balance the budget or to deal with over $90 million in       accumulated debt has prompted State legislation that could lead to a       Yonkers-style plan to control the City's financial management. While       fighting off attempts at State controls, the City administration       continues to defer payment on employee pension funds and has stopped       construction projects because of a shortage of funds.
