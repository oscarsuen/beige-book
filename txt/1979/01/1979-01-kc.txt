Business activity and inflation remain strong in the Kansas City   District. Purchasing agents report that input prices are rising at a   7 to 10 per cent rate and that they are beginning to encounter some   input availability problems. Fourth quarter retail sales were very   strong, but retailers expect some softening in upcoming months.   Financial conditions in the agricultural sector continue to improve   with the uptrend in farm prices, especially for livestock. The   recent improvement in farm cash flows has been reflected in better   liquidity positions at rural banks. Loan demand is reported to be   fairly strong throughout the District, and bankers are not expecting   any decline in interest rates before mid-1979.
Tenth District purchasing agents expect the prices of most major   inputs to continue rising in 1979 at approximately the same 7 to 10   per cent rate experienced during 1978. The prices of steel and   plastics have grown particularly rapidly during the past three   months. Lead times have been lengthening in nearly all industries   contacted, creating availability problems for some inputs. For   example, tools for the small aircraft industry are reported in   extremely short supply and the agricultural machinery industry is   finding steel difficult to obtain. No labor supply problems are   reported, except in the small aircraft industry where there is a   serious shortage of skilled workers. The agricultural equipment,   machinery and rubber products industries are operating at nearly   full capacity. Present levels of input inventories are satisfactory   for nearly all industries.
Retailers report that sales have been strong in recent months, and   extremely good in December. Clothing, toys, and electronic games   have been big sellers while fabrics and home decorations have been   unusually weak. Despite strong fourth quarter performance, business   activity is expected to slacken in 1979. Most retailers contacted   predict that sales in the first half of 1979 will be but 7 to 10 per   cent above those in the first half of 1978, before adjustment for   inflation. Though inventories are currently viewed as being at   satisfactory levels, many retailers plan some reductions by spring   in anticipation of the slowdown in sales growth.
Recent reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirm that   meat supplies for 1979 will probably exceed 1978 levels by a small   margin, with beef production declining and pork and poultry   production rising. The prospects for larger pork supplies-  particularly during the second half of 1979-may dampen some of the   upward price pressures in the cattle industry. Production levels for   corn and soybeans in 1978 were recently revised upward, adding   further to the abundant supplies available for 1978-79. Unless 1979   production levels are greatly reduced-an unlikely event based on the   planting intentions report-crop prices could weaken substantially   during the second half of the year.
One Bank director, who has consistently expressed concern about the   agricultural situation over the last two years, now feels that most   farmers are satisfying their cash-flow requirements. He observes   that consumers do not now seem to be resisting rising meat prices,   but wonders how much longer this situation will last. He believes   that the credit needs of farmers are generally being met by the   banking community, although the impact of rising interest rates on   farm cash flows is causing some concern. Money is now readily   available for livestock loans, but bankers are scrutinizing their   other agricultural loan requests quite closely.
Agricultural credit conditions in the District continue to show   improvement. Relative to a year ago, loan demand seems to have   tapered off, fund availability has increased, and farmers have   improved their repayment performance. Moreover, loan-deposit ratios   at rural banks declined slightly in the fourth quarter-but they are   still somewhat above year-earlier levels. The average ratio as of   January 1, 1979, was 62.2 per cent.
Tenth District bankers report widely varying experience in deposit   growth since mid-December, with the most common response being that   deposit growth has been lower than during most of 1978. Money market   CD's have continued to grow strongly, but there has been some   weakness in both savings deposits and IPC demand deposits. Bankers   express the view that ATS accounts will continue to grow in 1979,   although the initial growth spurt in these accounts is over. With   the exception of one Omaha bank, there are no plans to extensively   promote ATS accounts in the early part of 1979.
Loan demand is reported to be moderately strong, although several   bankers suggest that it has been slightly weaker than a year   earlier. Most banks report that loan-deposit ratios are about at the   desired level, but several banks that have recently experienced weak   deposit growth find themselves with slightly higher ratios than   would be preferred. One Kansas City bank reports that it is planning   to tighten nonprice terms on consumer loans, and several banks   report slightly more restrictive lending policies.
Bankers' expectations as to interest rates are fairly evenly divided   between those who think that interest rates are now at or near their   peak and those who expect some additional increases in short-term   rates. There is general agreement that rates will show little   decline before mid-1979.
