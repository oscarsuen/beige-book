This month's Redbook reports indicate that there are areas of   weakness in the economy, but also that evidence of a recession is   not widespread. The major area of decline has been automobile   manufacturing. Other manufacturing activity—particularly capital   goods production—appears to be holding its own. Residential   construction remains weak, but its losses have been offset by gains   in non-residential construction. Record crops are reported in most   parts of the country, and no petroleum supply problems have been   noted. Demand remains strong for most types of credit, and with the   exception of thrifts, lending institutions report relatively strong   deposit flows. Widespread price inflation continues, however, apart   from declines in prices of certain farm products. Also, most   businesses surveyed remain pessimistic about the future strength of   the economy.
Virtually all of the districts reported continued weakness in retail   sales, although back-to-school purchases have added temporary   strength to the figures. New York was the major exception to this   picture; one large chain headquartered there reported sales 20   percent ahead of last year. The more typical response was that of   Boston, which reported "disappointing" retail sales volume.
Automobile sales have recovered somewhat in most districts. The   manufacturers' program of rebates on large cars generally has   stimulated sales and pared inventories, although St. Louis and   Minneapolis still report excessive inventories. Small-car sales are   especially brisk in Atlanta and New York. Heavy truck sales appear   to be holding at record levels, but the recreational-vehicle market   Is still very weak.>
Automobile manufacturing, however, shows pronounced signs of   weakness. All three plants in St. Louis have reduced their work   force substantially. Chicago reports that about one-third of   Chrysler's hourly workforce is on indefinite layoff. It is feared   that at least one major plant will be closed permanently.
Most other manufacturing activity has been flat or growing, although   Philadelphia observes deterioration in the industrial sector.   Capital-goods manufacturers in the various districts generally   report increases in sales and backlogs. Machine-tool manufacturers   in the Cleveland district, for example, report delivery times   extended well into 1980. Although new orders for steel dropped   sharply in August—in line with the cut in automobile production   schedules—shipments to most other industries remain above last   year's level, and the industry does not expect a worsening picture.
Residential-construction activity continued its slide from last   month in most districts, although there are spots of strength in   areas such as Florida. Nonresidential-construction activity has   compensated for this weakness in many districts, however.
>As a result of the relatively stable condition of the non-automotive   sector, employment remains high in most areas. Several districts—notably San Francisco and Kansas City—report shortages of   specialized labor. Demand is particularly strong in commercial   construction, aerospace, aluminum and tool-and-die manufacturing.   The continued rapid growth of the Pacific Northwest economy has   particularly strengthened the demand for labor in that region.
Farm production reports are generally favorable. Kansas City and   Chicago expect record crops in such commodities as wheat and   soybeans, although storms recently damaged grapefruit crops in   Florida and 600,000 acres of cotton in Texas. Pork and poultry   production have increased. As a result of the increased production   in many commodities, farm prices have fallen, so that farm incomes   are likely to fall considerably short of earlier Department of   Agriculture forecasts. The. Rock Island strike and the grain-  handler's strike at Duluth/Superior pose grain transportation   problems.
Most districts report continued strength in demand for all types of   loans. However, Atlanta reports slack loan demand, and Dallas   reports resistance to high residential-mortgage rates. The supply of   funds at commercial banks appears to be holding up, with money-  market certificates compensating for outflows from other savings   categories. Cleveland and Richmond observe, however, that thrifts   are experiencing more difficulty obtaining funds. Atlanta sees a "softening" of deposit flows in general.
Although the economic picture remains relatively good at the present   time, the business community generally appears pessimistic about the   future. Respondents to Philadelphia's Business Outlook Survey appear   to be bracing for a further slowdown. Boston reports that business   firms have learned a lesson from the last recession, and that they   are watching inventories closely; throughout the districts, this is   reflected in moderate levels of inventories in most industries.   Meanwhile, reports of continued inflation in input prices are   widespread.
