Economic strengths continue to overshadow weaknesses in the nine-state area served by the San Francisco District, although many firms   are becoming increasingly cautious about the outlook. Capital   spending plans for both the immediate and longer-range future have   not been altered by fears of recession. Hiring continues strong in   most labor markets of the district. Retailers report relatively   strong sales, but have become cautious about future sales,   especially in Southern California.
A large Washington bank reports that the Northwest is still   experiencing very rapid economic growth. A large metals firm says   that its capital-spending plans remain unchanged, and that its   capital spending in 1980 should exceed even its 1979 record. A   Southern California utility reports that the expected slowdown in   the housing market has been built into its regional-growth estimates   and financial plans. And a major aircraft producer reports that the   crucial aerospace industry—a "lagging indicator"—has not been   measurably affected by the economic downturn.
Inventories at the manufacturing level have remained relatively   constant. Most retail firms are watching their inventories closely,   and are attempting to keep them quite lean.
Southern California retailers appear to be feeling more of a pinch   than most Westerners, and are becoming increasingly concerned about   further softening in sales trends and overaccumulation of   inventories. Some of these retailers are scaling back orders for the   Christmas season, with the expectation that holiday sales will be   weak to mediocre. Financial institutions involved with auto-dealer   loans are watching their dealers more closely, mainly with regard to   their stocks of unsold cars.
Employment continues high in the West, with demand for skilled labor   skyrocketing, as measured by a continued high volume of help-wanted   ads. In Utah and Idaho, businesses are complaining that they can't   find enough applicants for available positions. Academic   institutions in the Northwest continue to experience significant   shortages in the supply of clerical support staff. And a Los Angeles   food-products firm finds very few qualified people available to fill   recurring vacancies in good-paying positions.
Hiring programs remain strong at Northwest aluminum plants, where   operations are running at maximum capacity. Similarly, the Southern   California aircraft industry, which has a substantial backlog,   continues to hire aggressively. In fact, employment demand remains   strong in all components of the regional aerospace industry. Demand   is also high for workers on commercial construction projects   throughout the West.
Current bank-lending practices remain relatively unchanged, after   having been tightened several months ago. Loan demand has continued   very strong, while the availability of loanable funds has tightened   in comparison with earlier years. Because of rising loan-to-deposit   ratios, many bankers are curtailing real-estate lending activities,   and are closely scrutinizing the quality of all existing credit   lines.
Commercial-loan demand is still strong, reflecting the sustained   high levels of business activity. In general, banks have been   willing to accommodate the demand for short-term business loans, and   in Los Angeles, banks are continuing to compete keenly for this type   of loan. In the area of real-estate lending, however, banks are   exhibiting a healthy degree of caution. Still, the availability of   mortgage credit has held up quite well in the West, although   interest rates have escalated to new highs. Installment-loan volume   is beginning to soften because of both the energy problem and the   softening in auto sales. In view of rising consumer-debt ratios,   many Western financial institutions are placing additional emphasis   on consumer-loan quality.
