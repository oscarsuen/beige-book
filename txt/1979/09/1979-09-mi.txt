Although the national economy appears to be in a recession, the   Ninth District economy remains relatively strong. Last month, our   report indicated that the district's economy was not yet in a   recession, but that several developments were threatening it. The   consumer and agricultural sectors, in particular, are still   worrisome, but a strong industrial sector is allowing the district   to avoid a recession.
Auto and home sales continue to be weak, too. In August, car sales   fell below year-earlier levels, as they did in June and July, and   large car inventories are still excessive. District consumers   likewise continue to be hesitant to purchase homes; in August the   number of homes listed for sale was up substantially from a year   ago.
Farmers' earnings also could be reduced by smaller-than-expected   crops. A month ago district farmers were expecting a good harvest,   and many still are. But in Minnesota, the district's largest crop-  producing state, wet and cloudy August weather has kept crops from   maturing, and an early frost now could substantially reduce crop   yields.
In a recession, firms normally lay off workers, but many district   firms are now scrambling to hire additional ones. Some labor markets   are so tight that one large firm distributed handbills throughout   its community calling for more workers.
In a recession, business earnings normally decline, but this hasn't   happened. For the second quarter, the profits of the district's 41   largest companies were up from a year agoâ€”29 percent this quarter.
In a recession, business requests for loans let up, as businesses   consolidate operations. But directors report that the demand for   loans remains strong at district banks, as many firms continue to   expand.
