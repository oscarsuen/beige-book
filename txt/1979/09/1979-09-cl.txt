Business conditions in the Fourth District have shown evidence of   further inventory accumulations in August, but the consumer-centered   recession has not yet spread to the capital goods sector. Most   businessmen and economists forecast a shallow recession extending   into the second quarter of 1980. Manufacturers report that   inventories have been accumulating at a slow rate, but few are   concerned that inventory liquidation would pose a serious problem   for the remainder of this year. Bankers and retailers have mixed   viewpoints over prospects for a moderate comeback in consumer   spending, but even those more optimistic do not expect a comeback   that will be strong enough to reverse the downward trend of the   economy. The housing market has continued to show surprising   strength as mortgage loan demand has remained unchanged from last   month. The city of Cleveland has slipped deeper into default.
Most manufacturers report that involuntary inventory accumulation   has been occurring in the Fourth District. However, most had   expected some accumulation to occur as consumer spending slowed, but   have been unable to alter production schedules in anticipation of a   decline in orders. The inventory buildup, so far, has been   concentrated in material parts and components related to the auto   industry. A producer of consumer items reports that his inventory   buildup resulted from special market conditions for those items. The   standard view remains that tight controls on inventories over the   past year have kept inventories at satisfactory levels which can be   adjusted by slowing the rate of accumulation into the first quarter   of 1980.
Capital goods producers, in general, have experienced little direct   effect from the recession. An official in the machine tool industry   reports no major change in new orders, although the peak in orders   occurred early in the year. Some softness in machine tools is   expected over the next six to twelve months and one official expects   a "sudden" softening in the fourth quarter of 1979. However, because   delivery times are extended well into 1980 and backlogs are still   increasing, layoffs have not occurred. A manufacturer of truck parts   notes some weakness in heavy-duty trucks which can be attributed to   the general slowing of the economy. He also states that a rebound in   light truck sales could lead a recovery in the second quarter of   1980. A steel economist reports that new orders for steel dropped   sharply in August, but are not expected to get worse. However, he is   apprehensive that declines in the demand for metal building   materials may be a preliminary sign of the recession spreading into   the capital goods sector. The steel industries' operating rate is   likely to drop sharply next quarter to about 70% operating rate,   according to one economist. Most producers are concerned that   capital goods spending will soften over the remainder of the year if   availability of money tightens and the consumer recession spreads.
Retailers report some improvement in consumer demand related to   back-to-school purchases, which are predominately seasonal, and to   new car sales. Although operating at a satisfactory level, one   manufacturer of apparel notes that unit sales are off 20% for the   Fall season and are expected to be about 6% off this year from last.   Sales of nondurables have been on a down-trend all year, but one   super market official expects that any further retrenchments by the   consumer will be concentrated in durable goods. Consumers have been   increasingly shifting purchases away from inflationary items and one   retailer is concerned about the effect of income redistribution in   consumer buying, especially from rising food prices. However, a   District banker reports that consumer loan demand has been strong in   his area and has suggested that final demand will remain strong   enough through the Christmas season to spark a temporary consumer   comeback. A few others have taken a less sanguine view. They expect   consumer spending to worsen, because of increased consumer   resistance to high prices. In response to declining real incomes,   one retailer expects GAF sales next quarter to show about a 4% year-   over-year increase, about half of the increase that he expects for   the third quarter.
Housing market conditions have continued to experience relative   strength despite the recession. Building suppliers state that 1979   has been better than expected, but they are skeptical about 1980   prospects. A major regional builder of homes reports that housing   starts have been accelerating since June and are expected to be "rapid" through October. Although a banker is concerned about   housing inventories being increasingly financed through borrowing, a   builder reports no excess inventories at this time. Sales of   existing houses have continued to be slow in August, with a rising   number of requests by home owners for banks to finance both the old   and the newly purchased house until buyers can be found.
Mortgage and consumer loan demand has been strong in August, but   S&Ls are still having trouble competing with commercial banks for   loanable funds. Bankers report increasing funds flowing into the   banks, but S&Ls continue to borrow heavily from FHLBs. Mortgage   loans over the remainder of 1979 are expected to be below last   year's peak and interest rates on 80% mortgage loans are set to   increase by another twenty five basis points to 11-1/4% in some   parts of the District early in September. Consumer installment loan   demand has picked up, according to one area banker, because of a   switch from vacations to home recreation purchases. A banker notes   that even auto loans have made a comeback from April to June levels.
The city of Cleveland has gone into its second default after failing   to roll over $3.3 million in city-held waterworks notes. The first   default last December amounted to $15 million. A second default   became certain when City Council refused to allow the transfer of   general operating funds to the waterworks fund, because of the   questionable legality of the transfer. A third default on $14   million in city-held notes, also held by the waterworks fund, is now   probable in October. However, the city was able to pay about   $500,000 in interest payments on the original default.
