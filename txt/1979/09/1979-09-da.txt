Economic activity in the Eleventh District continues at the reduced   pace of recent months according to Directors and businessmen. Sales   promotions have helped boost auto sales in recent weeks. Deposit   growth at banks is sluggish, and many savings and loan associations   report net savings outflows. Mortgage lending in Texas is up   slightly, but the availability of credit remains somewhat   constrained by the state's new floating usury ceiling. Bank lending   is at a high level, but the rate of growth appears to be down from   earlier in the year. Manufacturing activity is flat.
Retail sales are improving following a two-month lull. Most of the   gains are coming from improved sales of large cars that are heavily   supported by advertising and price cutting. Most domestic auto   dealers report sales are running at year ago levels. Excess   inventories of large cars are slowly being reduced. Department store   sales are described by most executives as recently improved, but   they express concern that sales will weaken in coming months.
Buyers at the recent apparel market in Dallas were quite restrained   in their outlook for clothing sales this coming winter and expressed   concern that declining consumer sentiment would lead to a relatively   weak Christmas sales season. Overall, new orders at the market were   level with last year when adjusted for price increases.
Conventional mortgage lending activity in Texas is up slightly   following the adoption of a new floating usury ceiling late last   month. However, S&Ls in Texas continue hard pressed for loanable   funds. The current permissible mortgage rate of 11 percent is about   1/2 percentage point below yields in the secondary market, limiting   sales of mortgages by local S&Ls in the secondary market. In   addition, S&Ls in the District report either very weak net savings   inflows or actual outflows. FHA/VA mortgage lending is very strong.   Mortgage rates of about 11 1/2 percent in Louisiana have met with   much borrower resistance, and lending activity has not increased   significantly since the lifting of that state's usury ceiling two   months ago. Mortgage-backed municipal bonds are supporting lending   activity in some Louisiana cities.
Bank lending appears to be growing at a somewhat reduced pace   compared to earlier in the year as the rise in the prime rate is   having a mild effect on loan demand. Commercial borrowing remains   strong, while consumer borrowing is tapering off. Real estate   borrowing generally remains strong in Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston   although it appears to be easing somewhat elsewhere in the District.
Consumer goods industries are posting declines in output, while   capital goods industries continue to show moderate gains. The   slowing of retail sales of furniture and apparel is resulting in   declining employment and output at the manufacturing level. Most   furniture manufacturers report, however, that backlogs remain heavy   while new orders are down slightly. Home furniture sales are   slowing, but institutional furniture sales generally appear to be   keeping pace with increased commercial building activity. One   furniture manufacturer noted that thin profit margins are   constraining new hiring. Material supplies are tight, and prices   continue to rise rapidly. There appears to be no large buildup of   inventories at the manufacturing level.
Capital goods industries generally report favorable outlooks. Some   slowing of orders for heavy construction equipment is noted, but   construction activity remains strong in the District, keeping   production of equipment at a high level. New orders for mining   equipment are strong with one major producer crediting the large   expansion of uranium and lignite mining operations in South Texas   for increased bookings. Large backorders of drilling equipment were   reduced during the first-quarter downturn in drilling activity, and   delivery times have been reduced substantially. Although new orders   are once again picking up, there is some concern that the expansion   of industry-wide capacity over the past several years may prove to   be excessive next year, especially among drill bit manufacturers.
A buildup of inventories near the end of the distribution channel of   petrochemicals is expected to lead to a reduction of petrochemical   output early next quarter. Inventories at chemical plants remain   lean. Several producers expressed concern that current plant   expansions will be coming on stream just as new orders begin   tapering off, resulting in excess capacity. Exports of   petrochemicals continue strong as U.S. producers maintain a price   advantage over the rest of the world. But some softening could occur   as more European chemical facilities come on line.
A series of hail storms damaged approximately 600,000 acres of   cotton in the southern High Plains of Texas in late August. Corn,   soybean, milo, and sunflower crops were also affected by the storms.   Total losses are estimated to exceed $100 million.
The out-of-control oil well in the Gulf of Mexico is a cause of much   concern for fisheries, resorts, environmentalists, and property   owners, and a substantial decline of tourist business has been   reported.
