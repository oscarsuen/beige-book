According to interviews with District businessmen, overall economic   activity in August was unchanged from July, but is below that of the   first quarter of the year. The decline appears to be mild, except   for the automobile and housing industries. Consumer spending, which   has been sluggish in recent months, registered gains at about the   current rate of inflation. Inventories are being closely watched as   several businessmen expect the economic slowdown to continue for   several months. Output in the manufacturing sector appears unchanged   in recent weeks following a decline in the second quarter.   Construction activity, as a whole, remains strong with losses in   residential building offset by gains in other types of construction.   In the financial sector, inflows into savings and loan associations   continue to register small but positive gains. Reports indicate that   mortgage loan demand has slowed in recent weeks, whereas reports are   mixed about the strength of commercial loan demand.
Indications from area retailers are that real consumer spending was   unchanged from July to August. Some large department stores posted   nominal gains of 10-12 percent and a few retailers noted some   improvement in sales of household appliances and back-to-school   items. On the other hand, other retailers reported only small gains   and expressed disappointment about their recent sales volume.   Automobile sales improved in August as incentive programs offered by   dealers and manufacturers to reduce heavy inventories helped   generate sales. Car sales in the St. Louis District (eastern   Missouri and southern Illinois) of one major U.S. manufacturer were   down only slightly in August compared with a year ago. However,   sales on a year-to-date basis were down about 15 percent from a   similar period last year.
In general, inventories are reported to be at satisfactory levels   but inventories of automobiles, certain types of appliances, and   some apparel items are considered excessive. Automobile inventories,   however, are down substantially from a month ago as a result of   recent sales efforts. Some firms reported efforts to reduce   inventories in order to cut carrying costs and to bring them in line   with expected slower sales volumes. Some expressed the reservation   that an unwanted buildup of inventories may occur, since consumer   purchases did not seem strong enough to sustain current production   levels. Also, some respondents reported more hand-to-mouth buying of   raw materials and fewer long-term commitments.
Manufacturing activity appears to have stabilized in recent weeks   after noticeable declines in the second quarter. The declines   occurred largely in the automobile, lumber, furniture, textile, and   apparel industries. Layoffs have occurred at most District   automobile assembly plants. All three plants in St. Louis have   reduced their work force, with one plant cutting back workers by   one-third. Some manufacturing firms, particularly those producing   capital goods, continue to report strong activity. A major capital   goods manufacturer noted that incoming orders continue at "good" rates. Several smaller manufacturers of such items as industrial   motors, lubrication equipment, pumps, welding and cutting equipment,   and machine tools noted continued increases in sales and, in some   cases, growing backlogs.
Construction activity in the District remains at a high level,   despite declines in homebuilding. Housing construction appears to be   dawn about 15 to 20 percent from a year ago. Nonresidential building   activity, however, has registered sizable gains, and decreases in   labor employed in home construction have been largely absorbed in   the nonresidential building.
Savings and loan association representatives reported some gains in   savings inflows in August, but the rate of gain was slower than in   the first half of the year. Among individual S and Ls, however, the   pattern varied substantially, with those offering premiums and   advertising heavily attracting most of the new funds. The slower   growth of savings deposits is attributed to increased competition   from Treasury bills, money market certificates at banks, and money   market funds. Mortgage loan demand was reported to have slowed in   the past two months, but with fewer loanable funds, rates on 80   percent loans remain relatively high at 11-1/4 to 11-1/2 percent.   Some commercial bank representatives reported brisk demand for   commercial loans while others noted a recent slowing in demand for   such loans. Arkansas banks have cut back drastically on consumer   lending due to the high cost of funds relative to the "low" usury   ceilings on such loans.
The agricultural picture remains generally favorable for farmers.   Crop production is expected to be relatively large. However, as a   result of the recent decline in farm product prices, farm incomes   may not be quite as large as anticipated earlier in the year.
