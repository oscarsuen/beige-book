Agriculture and energy-based industries are providing support to the   Tenth District economy, but signs of weakness remain. Retail sales   are stronger, but still slow in real terms, and retailers are not   optimistic. Most manufacturers consider materials supplies to be   adequate, and many plan to cut inventories in anticipation of   declining sales. Farm prices are expected to contribute less to   inflation in the months ahead, although they rose sharply in   September. In District banks, loan demand continues strong, but   deposit growth is weaker than a year ago.
Retail sales in the Tenth District are showing substantial   improvement over earlier this year, and the dollar volume is up 5 to   10 per cent over this period last year. Most kinds of goods are   selling well, although business is slow in shoes and children's   apparel. Clearance sales did not begin any earlier this year, except   in the Denver area. Most retailers are satisfied with their   inventory levels but are ready to trim stocks if sales do not hold   up. Few expect sales to increase further during the next three   months, but all expect wholesale prices to continue to rise, forcing   more increases in prices at retail.
Purchasing agents in the Tenth District report increases in input   prices of 7 per cent or more over last year. The electronics   industry and industries using petroleum-based inputs are   experiencing especially steep price increases. Most buyers note an   acceleration in price increases since July. About half, however, do   not expect any substantial price hikes during the remainder of the   year. Inputs are still in short supply in the aerospace,   electronics, and small appliance industries. Half of the purchasing   agents in the other industries plan to cut their stocks of materials   soon, because of high interest rates and expected sales slowdowns.
Prices received by U.S. farmers rose 1.5 per cent in September-  because of improvement in prices for hogs, beef cattle, calves,   wheat, and milk-and now stand at 11 per cent over year-earlier   levels. Increases in prices received by Tenth District farmers were   somewhat greater than for the U.S. as a whole because of the   importance of livestock and wheat to District agriculture. Prices   paid by farmers for goods and services rose 1 per cent in September   to stand at 14 per cent over a year ago.
For the balance of 1979, farm prices are expected to remain fairly   flat. Continued increases in U.S. pork production will temper upward   pressure on meat prices. The September 1 U.S. Department of   Agriculture hog and pig report indicates producers in the 14 major   states-accounting for about 86 per cent of the U.S. hog and pig   inventory-are still expanding production. The breeding inventory was   up 10 per cent and the market hog inventory was up 17 per cent from   year-earlier levels. Moreover, the summer pig crop increased 16 per   cent over a year ago while fall and winter farrowing intentions were   up 13 and 10 per cent, respectively. These data indicate abundant   pork supplies through mid-1980.
Grain storage and transportation continue to concern farmers and the   grain industry. However, principally because of increased nonfarm   storage, it appears that Tenth District farmers will find adequate   storage for the record soybean and corn crops to be harvested this   fall. Transportation problems are more persistent, with farmers and   country elevators making greater use of trucks-at increased   transportation costs-to transport grain to elevators and terminals   on main rail lines or barge lines.
Transportation bottlenecks, such as continued delays in getting the   Rock Island Railroad moving, could jeopardize the ability of U.S.   grain merchants to supply the potential export demand during the   1979-80 marketing year.
Except for some bankers in metropolitan areas, most Tenth District   bankers report continued strength in loan demand. Agricultural loans   at country banks are particularly strong, as are energy-related   loans in Oklahoma and New Mexico. Other categories in general are   growing at rates similar to a year ago. Some larger metropolitan   banks are experiencing weaker demands for commercial loans in   particular, but also for real estate, consumer, and construction   loans. All bankers report raising their prime or base lending rates   in the last month. Most metropolitan banks currently have prime   rates of 13 1/2 per cent, following the lead of the large money   center banks. Further increases in the prime rate of 1/4 to 1   percentage point are expected by year- end. Most bankers say they   are more selective now than a year ago, and some express concern   over their ability to meet existing customers' loan demands in the   near future.
Deposit growth at Tenth District banks generally appears weaker than   a year ago. Savings deposits are growing moderately or are down at   most banks. Large CD's and money market certificates, however, are   continuing to increase at nearly all banks. Some bankers also report   increased purchases of Federal funds and discount window borrowings   in recent months. Most bankers expect deposit growth to improve soon   due to seasonal factors. However, except for some country bankers,   they generally believe this growth will be less than in past years.   Stronger growth than usual may occur at country banks due to   unusually strong agricultural conditions.
