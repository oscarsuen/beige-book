The Ninth District economy appears generally better now than a month   ago. Agricultural conditions were improved by the recent settling of   the Duluth/Superior grain handlers' strike and by excellent weather,   and nonagricultural conditions continue to be favorable, as they   were last month.
District firms are still hiring workers instead of laying them off,   as the district's current large volume of help wanted advertising   suggests. The absence of layoffs last month is reflected in the low   number of workers presently claiming unemployment compensation. Loan   requests at district banks also reflect the strength of the   district's economy. Most bank directors report strong business loan   demand at their area's commercial banks and attribute this demand to   the district economy's current strength.
This strength is also confirmed by indicators of capital spending   and inventories, which we did not cover last month. The usual easing   in capital spending that accompanies a recession has not occurred.   In the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, a sizable number of large   commercial construction projects is under way. Outside the Twin   Cities, several directors indicate that their area's businesses are   either expanding or improving their facilities. In addition, the   unwanted inventory accumulation that characterizes a recession has   yet to occur in the district. With the exception of large   automobiles, directors report that district firms are not confronted   with excess inventories. In fact, two large manufacturing firms   located in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area indicate that their   inventories of finished goods are lower than desired, and three of   the area's largest retailers report that present inventories are   satisfactory. Due to sales promotions, even the troubling auto   inventory situation is better now than in July and August.
Finally, some directors say that high interest rates are causing   problems for some small businesses.
