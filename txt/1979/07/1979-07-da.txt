Economic activity in the Eleventh District is slowing, but it does   not appear to be directly attributable to the current energy   situation according to Directors and businessmen surveyed this   month. Department store sales continue to run just ahead of the pace   of inflation even though auto sales appear to be slowing somewhat.   The gasoline shortage and truckers' strike are having a mild effect   on industrial output. Many industrial firms report some softening in   demand for their products, and overall industrial activity appears   flat. Bank lending at large banks remains very active; smaller   banks, however, report some softening in loan demand. Deposits at   banks and savings and loan associations continue to show moderate   growth.
Department store sales are running slightly ahead of the 6- to 7-  percent rate of increase in merchandise prices. Although unit sales   are flat, a gradual erosion of unit sales is expected through the   remainder of the year. Summer clearance sale promotions and price   cutting are contributing significantly to sales. Retail executives   expressed a need to cut inventories to bring them in line with the   expected slowdown in sales. Auto sales are slowing and have fallen   below last year's level, but the decline does not appear to be as   steep in the Southwest as for the nation as a whole. Sales of fuel-  efficient cars remain brisk, and inventories are tight. Dealers   report delivery times for compact cars are lengthening.
Lending activity at weekly reporting banks remains very strong.   Commercial and industrial loans, especially to energy-related   industries, and construction loans continue to be among the   strongest areas of loan demand. Consumer lending is also   exceptionally active, prompting a few banks to be more selective in   granting consumer loans to keep them within planned levels. Loan   demand is somewhat softer and liquidity is tighter at smaller banks   in the District. Many small banks report loan growth is currently   flat and are anticipating a slowdown in coming months. Deposit   growth is accelerating moderately at both large and small banks.
Net deposit inflows at savings and loan associations showed further   improvement in recent weeks but remain well below a year earlier.   The higher interest rates on savings accounts starting July 1 are   not expected to either improve deposit flows or slow the transfer of   funds from savings accounts into time accounts. Mortgage lending   remains very sluggish in Texas apparently because of the state's 10-  percent usury ceiling. The ceiling will be floated two percentage   points above the 10-year Treasury bond rate starting August 28. The   new ceiling is still expected to be somewhat restrictive, and   lenders are also concerned that perspective borrowers will be   reluctant to pay the higher rate.
The overall impact of the independent truckers' strike on District   agriculture appears minimal thus far. Transportation bottlenecks   occurred in the watermelon producing areas of South Texas where the   greatest impact was on small farms that lacked storage facilities.   Shipments are again in progress although some shortages of trucks to   haul vegetables and cattle are still being reported in the District.   The wheat harvest is well underway, and record output is projected.   In Texas, production is estimated to reach nearly 115 million   bushels, more than double last year's crop. Yields are projected at   40 percent above last year. Estimated yields and output are also   substantially greater than last year in Oklahoma and New Mexico.
Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston are now on an odd-even gasoline   rationing plan, and the long lines at gasoline stations have   shortened, but many stations are open only briefly and   intermittently. There has been no major disruption of business   because of the gasoline shortage thus far. The independent truckers'   strike appears to be having only isolated effects on manufacturing   activity. Only a few of the firms surveyed reported problems arising   from the independent truckers' strike. A few other firms see a   potential supply problem developing if the strike continues much   longer. The strike has not affected movement of cargo through the   ports of Houston or Galveston.
Industrial growth appears to be slowing in many major industries,   and unemployment has begun to rise slightly. Durable goods   manufacturing is the area of greatest softening with small declines   evident in machinery and metal production. Most drilling equipment   manufacturers, however, have not felt any major effect from the   decline in drilling rig count. They expect demand to remain strong   for several years to come. Responses in the apparel and textile   industry are quite mixed according to type of product. Jeans and   skirt manufacturers continue to report healthy gains in new orders.   Apparel manufacturing activity overall, however, has shown several   months of decline. Newsprint remains in tight supply, and paper   producers continue to operate at capacity.
