Responses to our latest Survey of Fifth District Business Conditions   suggest only minor changes in the level of activity over the past   month. Manufacturers, as a group, apparently experienced very slight   declines in the volume of new orders and order backlogs. In   addition, inventories were up despite an increase in shipments.   Responses concerning employment and weekly hours worked suggest some   gains in production are continuing to occur. Increases in prices   paid have become even more widespread in recent weeks although   employee compensation and prices received do not seem to have   followed suit, at least according to this month's survey. The   outlook of our respondents has also deteriorated since the last   survey. Indications are that aggregate credit demand in the region   has softened somewhat since May, but also that there have been no   dramatic shifts in the pattern of loan demand for major types of   loans. The current truck strike is having an unfavorable impact on   the farm income situation. State agriculture officials, especially   in the Carolinas, indicate that the strike is resulting in   tremendous financial losses for producers of vegetable crops and   peaches.
Manufacturers reporting a reduced volume of new orders slightly   outnumbered those reporting gains in orders over the past month.   Much the same was true of responses concerning changes in backlogs   of orders. Nearly two-thirds of all respondents nevertheless   continued to experience either unchanged or higher levels of both   orders and backlogs. Inventories of materials and finished goods   also appear to have risen on balance, but only about one respondent   in four views current stocks as excessive. Shipments were apparently   up somewhat among those manufacturers surveyed although gains were   less widespread than in our previous survey period. There has also   been some increase in the incidence of reports that current plant   and equipment may be excessive, but such responses continue to   represent a relatively small proportion of total responses. There   remains virtually no sentiment among respondents for altering   current expansion plans.
Approximately one-third of the manufacturing respondents report   increased levels of employment over the month and there was also   some small increase in the average workweek among responding firms.   Although nearly three-fourths of our respondents report paying   higher prices last month, the number experiencing gains in employee   compensation and prices received actually declined. Expectations of   manufacturers have become decidedly more negative in recent weeks.   Three-fourths of those surveyed expect the level of business   activity nationally to worsen over the remainder of the year and   over half expect some worsening in their respective market areas.   Only about one-fourth, however, expect conditions for their own   firms to decline over the next six months.
In the retail sector there does not seem to be any clearly   discernible pattern. In some areas sales have weakened while in   others they are holding up surprisingly well. One of our directors   reports firm sales activity up until just the last few days, and   further feels that this very recent weakening is more consistent   with his expectations than the earlier performance. One respondent   in the building materials line also reports sales continuing to hold   steady. Survey responses also suggest some running down of   inventories by retailers, which seems to be consistent with their   doubts about whether sales can continue at recent levels.
The demand for commercial and industrial loans appears to have   tapered after showing unusual strength earlier this year. In   particular, term loans for capital expansion have shown weakness. At   the same time, short-term loan demand has increased about with the   rate of inflation. Inventory financing has hardly increased at all   if measured in terms of physical volume of goods, and reports   suggest that the buildup of stocks for the Christmas season will be   delayed as retailers hold back to gauge the strength of their   markets. Loan demand from construction related businesses has led   other sectors due largely to the surge in materials prices. Consumer   installment loan outstandings continue to increase while the number   of loans made is holding fairly steady. Consumer revolving credit   activity, however, continues strong. Several banks have stated that   they feel the peak in consumer loan demand has been reached.   Mortgage loan demand is strong in most areas, but activity is being   limited by a scarcity of funds at savings and loan associations. The   volume of new funds received in money market certificate accounts at   the thrift institutions has dropped considerably, while losses   continue in other categories of time deposits. Liquidity positions   are comfortable at most large commercial banks.
District cash farm income was one-third above a year ago during the   period January to April, but the current truck strike is having an   unfavorable impact at the present time. Because of the lack of   trucks, thousands of bushels of perishable vegetables have been left   to rot at shipping points. Other crops. ready to be harvested, have   been plowed up. Virginia reports indicate that operations of meat   packaging plants, dependent on out-of-state shipments, have been   significantly affected. And both meat packing plants and some   poultry processing plants have been severely affected in moving   their products from plant to market. In addition, official reports   suggest tighter diesel fuel and gasoline supplies for farm work in   some District states. Farm work in some areas is being delayed by   late deliveries of fuel or the inability to obtain fuel when needed.
