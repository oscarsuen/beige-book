In the past few weeks, the two most significant factors affecting   the southeastern economy were gasoline availability problems and the   nation's independent truckers' strike. Despite some trouble spots,   District gas supplies appear to be holding up better than in the   nation at large. The truckers' strike caused serious disruptions and   hardships for the District's agricultural sector and exacerbated   gasoline supply problems. Consumer spending has been sluggish and   many retailers have expressed increased uncertainty regarding future   sales and inventory levels. Some slowdown in single-family   residential construction has been discernible, except in Florida and   the Atlanta metropolitan area. Banking contacts expressed concern   over the ability of higher interest rates on savings to attract new  money. Loan demand, except for home loans, has remained strong.   Commercial construction and industrial activity have been healthy.
The independent truckers' strike had a severe impact on the   District's agricultural sector. Many farmers were unable to secure   the delivery of excellent harvests to market. Alabama's corn,   potato, and bean growers, as well as south Georgia's and Florida's   watermelon growers, experienced substantial losses. Large poultry   losses throughout the District were also incurred because of the   necessity to destroy chicks and eggs. Additionally, layoffs and   reduced payrolls occurred in food processing industries. An estimate   of the strike's full impact is, at present, somewhat conjectural;   however, it is certain that convoys escorted by the National Guard   or the state police mitigated delivery problems and prevented   wholesale disaster for some farmers.
The strike and actual or threatened violence to nonstriking truckers   worsened existing gasoline supply problems. The areas reportedly   experiencing the most critical availability problems and the longest   gasoline lines were northern Alabama and southern Florida. Gasoline   availability in Georgia and Tennessee has remained generally   adequate, helped by a reduction in the tourist traffic. Purchase   limits and reduced station hours are now the rule throughout the   District, but odd-even rationing has been effected only in south   Florida.
Although passenger travel by plane and train has increased   dramatically, the gasoline situation has cut so deeply into auto   travel that total tourism has dropped rather sharply. In late June,   tourism in Florida was reported to be down 10 percent.
The overall attitude of contacts regarding consumer spending is   increasingly one of caution and uncertainty. Although some retailers   have reported increases commensurate with inflation, most reported   sluggish sales. Inventories have been held to manageable, albeit   slightly higher than desired, levels. Ordering policies have been   adjusted to the uncertain outlook: one major retailer is making   smaller, more frequent buying trips; another is keeping cancellation   options open. Automobile sales also have been flat or declining. The   previously reported inventory imbalance still exists; namely, an   abundant supply of new and used large automobiles and a critical   shortage of smaller, fuel-efficient cars. The Atlanta area Ford LTD   plant was again closed for two consecutive weeks.
A continuing slowdown in single-family housing construction has been   evident in many areas of the District, except Florida and Atlanta   where a steady influx of new businesses continued. Sales of existing   homes are still considered strong. However, realtors in Nashville,   southern Mississippi, and Louisiana reported a tempering of demand   by high mortgage rates. Because of anticipated price rises, build-  ups of inventories of building supplies, particularly concrete   products, have occurred in certain areas. Commercial construction   continues to be fairly strong. Various office buildings, hospitals,   etc., are under construction throughout the District, and a major   redevelopment of Tampa's central business district is now under way.
Districtwide, consumer and business loan demand have remained   strong. However, most banking contacts report that deposit growth   has not been keeping pace with loan growth. Many bankers are   concerned about extremely low personal savings rates and skeptical   that the higher rates for passbook accounts and certificates will   attract much new money. The net effect, in their opinion, will be a   higher cost of funds with minimal deposit growth. The lifting of the   usury ceiling in Tennessee, as expected, provided new investment   funds, particularly for shopping centers and office buildings.
Industrial activity has continued at a healthy pace. Several   corporations announced plans or began construction on new plants or   expansions to existing facilities. A new newsprint plant that   recycles newspapers as its main raw material began operations in   Dublin, Georgia, during May. Construction of an offshore superport   in Louisiana began and is expected to produce 35,000 jobs when   satellite industries are established. The most significant   development in the District was the commencement of the Kings Bay   Navy Base project along the southern coast of Georgia near the   Florida border. This project is expected to provide employment for   60,000 in the local economy and $200 million in construction.
