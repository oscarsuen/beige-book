Manufacturing activity in the Fourth District is rebounding from   effects of the teamsters strike last month, and major industries are   producing at or near effective capacity. Consumer spending has been   sluggish except for autos, but business spending has been sustained   by further increases in orders and backlogs. Officials claim little   sign of speculation or excessive inventory buildup. They uniformly   see little sign of price relief for industrial products. Gasoline   supplies are tight but have not disrupted business activity. Deposit   inflows into S&Ls fell sharply in April. The city of Cleveland   remains in default.
Employment, production and shipments in the automotive and steel   industries, the main industries affected by the teamsters strike,   are recovering. However, some production losses of large cars will   not be recouped because of poor sales. Also, steel haulers in the   Youngstown Steel Producing Center are still not back to work. As   much as 10 percent of steel production schedules in April were   curtailed, in addition to cutbacks in steel shipments. Presently,   steel is operating at practical capacity, which is expected to   continue through the balance of this quarter because of strong   demand from the construction and capital goods industries. Steel   economist expect some easing next quarter, partly from lower demand   from the auto and appliance industries, and also because some   facilities will be shut down for repairs during the summer months.   Aluminum is operating at about 94 percent of capacity and an even   higher operating rate is expected next quarter.
District officials continue to report a widening dichotomy between   the consumer and business sectors. Some retailers and producers of   consumer goods believe a cyclical turning point is near unless   consumer spending shows a pickup in real terms. Remarks about   consumer resistance to higher prices, increased consumer   substitution, especially of food products, lack of strength in most   department store type-goods, and moderation in credit card usage,   are increasingly common. Although one retail economist expects   retail sales in May will show a larger increase than in April, most   of the expected gain would be absorbed by higher prices. In his   opinion, retail sales are on a plateau similar to 1974. He expects   deceleration in income gains this quarter, which along with   continued double-digit rates of inflation, would further reduce real   spending. Because of uncertainty over sales prospects, retailers   have been cutting their fall orders by at least 15 percent in real   terms, according to a producer of men's apparel.
Capital goods producers are still bullish over sales prospects, and   some have pushed back their expectations for a decline in orders to   the second half of this year or early next year. Their comments   emphasize continued increases in orders and backlogs, but they   generally report no sign of double-orders because shortages are not   prevalent as they were in 1974. Aerospace and machine tool builders   report backlogs at the end of last quarter were at least 50 percent   higher than a year earlier. Strength in machine tool orders has been   widespread because of growing need for modernization and for   additional capacity, according to one builder.
With few exceptions, district officials assert there is little sign   of speculative building of inventories, although most acknowledge   some buildup in stocks in line with higher production and backlogs.   A ball bearing producer notes some speculative buying that has been   triggered by his firm's allocation of production. Limited supplies   of domestic steel, coupled with a curtailed volume of steel imports   in recent months, have held the buildup in steel inventories to   normal levels relative to current usage, although one economist   believes that some steel users must hedge in order to protect   production schedules. Similarly, an economist asserted that the low   volume of imports and strong domestic demand have prevented a   buildup of aluminum inventories. Tire inventories held by retailers   are believed to be consistent with industry targets, especially in   view of the strike against one tire producer.
Officials uniformly report little sign of relief from recent intense   price pressures for industrial products. Some complain about COLA   cost pressures. However, a steel economist notes that guidelines   will limit future steel price increases this year to about 4   percent, although the market can absorb a much larger increase.   Also, a machine tool builder indicated price increases are being   held down to some extent by wage-price guidelines. A scheduled   increase in aluminum prices was recently scaled downward because of   guidelines, although domestic prices are said to be far below world   prices.
Gasoline supplies in the District are tight but apparently not as   serious as some other regions of the country. While business   activity has not yet been hampered by spot shortages, some   economists believe short supplies of diesel fuels may disrupt   industrial activity later this year. Production and sales of   recreational vehicles and light trucks for personal use have been   curtailed rather sharply in response to higher prices and reduced   availability of gasoline.
S&Ls report a sharp drop in deposits since the change in money   market certificates last March. However, they acknowledge that April   is typically a poor month for deposits and that some rebound has   occurred in early May, even in passbook accounts. Apparently, a   large part of the decline in April was the result of depositors   failing to roll-over maturing certificates and placing funds into   passbook accounts for temporary liquidity. Mortgage loan demand is   reported to be rising seasonally but is not as strong as a year-ago.   Some association officials expect a further increase in mortgage   lending rates because of reduced availability of mortgage funds.
As Cleveland enters its sixth month in default, local banks that   hold $14.5 million in notes are becoming increasingly critical of   the city's inability to present an acceptable repayment plan. One   local bank, which has not received information about the city's   budget revenues and expenditures during 1979, has threatened to seek   a court ruling on the city's obligation to begin repaying the notes.   The mayor has responded to the bank's concern by stating that, if   state aid is not obtained soon, the city would begin re-payment in   July and would repay the total amount by the end of the year.   Whether such a repayment schedule could be attained without further   cutbacks in operating expenses is uncertain. Indeed, it is unclear   whether the city is currently able to meet operating expenses other   than payrolls and debt service.
