The Ninth District economy is currently very strong, but this Bank's   directors see signs of weakening ahead. Poor weather might cut crop   production and produce excess inventories at retail stores.   Government regulations could disrupt economic activity. And larger   loan requests combined with lackluster deposit growth point toward   rising interest rates.
Directors report recent sizable gains in district business activity.   In the region's large urban areas, commercial and industrial   activity is expanding vigorously. The northeastern part of the   district is enjoying a strong demand for iron ore and forest   products. High livestock prices are propelling farm income above   last year's high level in central and western areas. And throughout   the district, auto and consumer hard goods are selling well.
One is bad weather, which they think could hurt farm production   especially. A dry fall and a severe winter have destroyed half of   the winter wheat crop in South Dakota and up to 70 percent of it in   parts of Montana. The wet and unseasonably cold spring is preventing   farmers from reseeding this acreage or planting their spring crops.   In Minnesota by early May, just 6 percent of the spring wheat, 15   percent of the oats, and 1 percent of the barley and corn were   planted; the 1974-78 averages range from 30 to 60 percent. This   planting delay has substantially shortened the growing season, which   increases the likelihood of reduced yields.
The colder-than-normal weather has already reduced sales at the   district's retailers. Last month directors reported that retailers   were hoping better weather would boost their soft goods sales. But   the weather did not improve, and merchants are still reporting poor   soft good sales. Unless these sales pick up soon, unwanted   inventories will start accumulating.
The wage and price guidelines can disrupt businesses, as a current   labor dispute illustrates. Early this month 2,700 workers walked off   their jobs at a large district computer manufacturer. These strikers   are demanding a 10 percent salary increase, but their employer is a   large government contractor and claims the 7 percent wage guideline   prohibits it from meeting the strikers' demand. If this company   exceeded the guideline, it could be barred from obtaining government   contracts.
If enacted, a federal gasoline rationing program could also disrupt   the district's economy. So far, gasoline shortages have caused   little trouble in this area, and supplies are available for farmers'   spring planting. But directors fear that the market won't be allowed   to ration available supplies this summer. A government-mandated   rationing program could seriously cut back the district's tourist   business.
