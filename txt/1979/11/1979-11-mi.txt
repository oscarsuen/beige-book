Lending has been curbed by usury ceilings and by customers'   reluctance to pay higher interest rates. Reduced lending, though,   has not changed our Bank directors' assessment of district economic   activity. Due to strong industrial activity and generally favorable   agricultural conditions, the region's economy is still growing.
District banks are having to pay higher rates to attract funds. As   money market rates go up, for example, banks have had to sell more   money market certificates in order to retain deposits. In fact, one   director reports that his area's bank customers are cashing in   lower-yielding certificates and taking interest penalties in order   to take advantage of the more favorable rates on money market   certificates.
These higher interest costs are curbing bank lending. In areas and   markets where banks' interest costs are approaching or exceeding   usury ceilings, lending is no longer profitable. Directors indicate   usury ceilings have recently dried up mortgage credit in South   Dakota and Wisconsin with their 12 percent usury ceilings. Consumer   and agricultural lending in some areas has also been curtailed by   usury laws.
And where higher interest costs can be passed on, bank customers are   becoming hesitant to borrow. Directors report that commercial loan   requests have slackened in response to recent interest rate   increases. Many merchants, auto dealers, and farm implement dealers   would now rather pare inventories than pay higher interest costs.
This letup in lending activity has yet to change our directors'   assessment of the district economy. This Bank's previous Redbooks   reported that the district economy was not in a recession, despite   problem areas. Industrial activity had been strong, and agricultural   conditions had been generally good, despite troubling weather and   transportation bottlenecks. Our reports, however, did indicate some   softness in consumer spending, especially for automobiles and   housing. This assessment is still valid in early November. District   industrial output is expanding. Directors from the Upper Peninsula   of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin state that manufacturing in   their areas is expanding briskly. While in Montana, industrial   production related to energy supplies is increasing.
This greater production is reflected in the region's strong demand   for workers. Several directors indicate that employers in their   areas are seeking additional workers. One large Minneapolis/St. Paul   manufacturer, for example, is trying to hire 180 production workers.   These observations are confirmed by the district's recent high   volume of help wanted advertising.
Complementing the district's strong industrial activity are the   region's generally good agricultural conditions. According to our   latest Agricultural Credit Conditions Survey, most agricultural   producers' current incomes are either the same as or greater than   they were last year.
Some developments, however, are troubling two sectors of the   district economy. First, poor weather and transportation bottlenecks   are restricting some farmers' incomes. Wet October weather is   retarding the corn harvest. In southwest Minnesota, for example,   about 89 percent of the corn crop is still in the fields. But even   if farmers could have completed the harvest, a lack of rail   transportation would have made getting it to market difficult.   Second, some difficulties are being experienced by retailers. Modest   October sales are reported by a large Minneapolis/St. Paul area   retailer. Also, directors describe their area's recent retail sales   as "soft," "mixed," or "spotty." And they describe their area's home   and automobile sales as "weak."
