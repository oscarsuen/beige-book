Continued inflation and a slowing economy, but no excessive   inventory accumulation, characterize the Tenth District economy.   Purchasing agents report that quarterly price increases have now   become standard. They continue to hold inventories under tight   control as do retailers. The latter group seems to be experiencing   money illusion, as increases in nominal dollar sales at a rate less   than the rate of inflation are viewed optimistically. In District   agriculture, a larger seeded acreage of winter wheat than last year   is expected. Commercial banks have significantly tightened their   credit policies in the past month.
Purchasing agents in the Tenth District report input price increases   of at least 8 per cent over last year, with almost half citing price   rises of 15 per cent or greater. The large majority have experienced   price gains in the past three months, and anticipate further hikes   in the very near future. Many report that quarterly price increases   have become standard. The input availability problems experienced   earlier in the year have been alleviated, and the consensus is that   inputs will continue to flow smoothly in the coming months.   Materials inventories in the Tenth District have been trimmed and   are being held under tight control due to the uncertainty concerning   sales and to high interest rates. Over half the companies contacted   report a moderate amount of excess plant capacity, with just one   company expressing a need for plant expansion. District firms do not   appear to be having any problems due to labor shortages.
The majority of retailers contacted in this month's survey report   gains in year-to-date sales of approximately 5 per cent to 12 per   cent. Appliances and home furnishings have been selling best in   recent months, while energy related home improvement products have   also been strong. Most retailers are satisfied with current   inventory levels and anticipate no major adjustments during the   coming Christmas buying season. With little feeling of inventory   overhang, almost all retailers expect clearance sales to follow the   same timing as last year. Sales expectations for the remainder of   the year are basically optimistic, paralleling strong gains in the   most recent three months. Some retailers, however, do expect sales   to flatten out this Christmas season. Prices are expected to rise as   cost increases are passed along, but these anticipated increases do   not include any increases in profit margins. Retailers will try to   maintain current profit margins in the uncertain months ahead by   continuing to exercise tight control over inventory levels.
Recent rain and snow over much of the Southern Plains hard red   winter wheat belt brought some relief to generally dry conditions.   While additional moisture is needed, farmers are completing final   seeding-delayed because of dry weather. A larger seeded acreage than   last year is expected, since there will be no 1980 required acreage   set-aside for farmers to be eligible for wheat target price   protection and Commodity Credit Corporation grain loans. Late   seeding and dry weather mean there will be only limited amounts of   wheat pasture available for fall and winter grazing of stocker   cattle. This, coupled with the high interest rates on cattle loans,   has caused farmers to delay stocker cattle purchases. As a result,   the demand for, and the prices of, cattle to be placed on pasture   this fall are somewhat lower than would otherwise be true. Prices   for most raw farm products important to Tenth District producers   registered declines in October. An especially sharp drop of 4 per   cent in meat animal prices was recorded. Prices for cattle, hogs,   calves, soybeans, corn, and broiler chickens declined, while the   only Tenth District farm commodities showing increases were wheat   and milk.
Tenth District banks surveyed this month report a significant   tightening of credit policies since October 6. In addition to   raising interest rates where not prevented from doing so by usury   ceilings, banks report that they are being much more careful in   their credit evaluations. There is a widespread fear that some   potential borrowers may not have sufficient cash flow to make   repayments at current levels of interest rates. Several banks   specifically mentioned that they are trying to avoid loans to   finance speculative activity. District banks have become especially   restrictive in the consumer lending area, particularly in Kansas,   Missouri, Nebraska, and New Mexico where state usury ceilings are   holding down rates. In these states, many banks appear to have   completely abandoned automobile lending. Banks throughout the   District report that they are becoming more restrictive in credit   card lending. High interest rates appear to have significantly   dampened credit demand, except for loans to firms in the energy   industry. District banks with significant energy-lending activity   report little if any decline in the demand for credit. Mortgage   lending appears to be rapidly grinding to a halt in the District. In   states where usury ceilings are a factor, both banks and savings and   loans have virtually stopped making commitments. In other states, a   shortage of funds has caused many mortgage lenders to deliberately   set interest rates at levels that they feel will choke off demand.
