A serious downturn in the District economy has not occurred, but   weaknesses are becoming increasingly evident. Generally, retail   sales have remained steady; however, auto sales declined. In many   areas, new home construction decelerated abruptly. Presently,   commercial building is propping up the construction industry, but   record interest rates will likely have a severe dampening effect on   future projects. Across the board, inventories are expected to   remain low because of nearly prohibitive financing charges.   Delinquencies on consumer credit are rising, but unemployment   remains relatively low.
Retail sales gains were moderate, but retailers are becoming less   optimistic about future prospects. Retailers at a major mid-  Tennessee shopping mall report that sales are not meeting   expectations. In south Alabama, most soft goods merchants report   very slow sales, while a major Birmingham retailer indicates   extremely strong sales in the first half but weak sales in the   second half of October. Comments from Florida were still upbeat;   however, two south Florida directors see signs of sluggishness. As   with automobiles, the pleasure boat business has turned sharply   downward because of abruptly increased financing costs. Also, high   financing costs for retailers' inventories will keep these   inventories to a minimum. Many contacts report that consumers are   becoming very price and quality conscious and that credit buying is   being curbed. Consumer credit delinquencies continue to increase at   many banks.
With the expiration of Chrysler's initial rebate program and the   jump in auto loan rates in October, auto sales turned down.   Increasingly strict credit requirements by lenders for auto loans   are further dampening sales. Dealers are keeping inventories to a   minimum because of drastically increased floor plan expenses.
The two GM plants in the Atlanta area, which heretofore have not   experienced large-scale, indefinite layoffs, recently announced that   the entire Doraville night shift of 2,200 workers and the truck   assembly line of 650 employees at Lakewood will be laid off near the   end of November.
Declines in residential construction are prevalent throughout the   District except in Florida, which so far has experienced unchanging   resiliency. Comments from northeast and central Florida indicate   continued buoyancy. Housing starts in Nashville and Knoxville are   down sharply. In northern Alabama, one contact reports that very few   starts are expected for the rest of 1979, while another says new   construction activity is at a "virtual standstill." Residential   mortgage funds in most of the District are becoming scarce.   Nonetheless, some S&L's report adequate funds, together with   drastically reduced demand and a dearth of qualified applicants.
Commercial and industrial construction continues to prop up local   economies throughout the District. However, contacts caution that   ongoing projects were funded long ago. Present commercial   construction levels are providing relief for some building materials   suppliers who would otherwise be faced with declining orders   resulting from a drop-off in residential construction. Record   interest rates and decreased availability of funds do not augur well   for a continuation of healthy nonresidential construction activity.   Additionally, a northern Alabama contact reports that new orders at   architectural firms, the initial step of a construction project,   have slowed markedly.
The sharp spurt in interest rates has had pervasive repercussions.   The sophistication of savers is evidenced by a noticeable flow of   funds from banks to higher-yielding money market instruments. For   most District banks, loan demand is down, and an increasingly   cautious attitude is being taken regarding borrowers and liquidity.   One commercial banker reports he is making loans to preferred   customers in the interest of goodwill. An Atlanta credit union has   stopped loans entirely for furniture, appliances, and furnishings.   It is their intent to seriously curtail all lending activities, but   they have not forbidden all loans because of a concern for customer   relations. In Tennessee, it is reported that large institutional   investors, such as Prudential and Metropolitan Life, have taken   their money out of the long-term market and placed it in short-term   commitments.
District-wide, employment remains firm. Unemployment is expected to   nudge steadily upward in coming months. However, contacts from   localities with a diversified, service-oriented economic base   repeatedly express confidence regarding the ability of their area to   perform better than the nation in the event of adverse economic   developments. Atlanta, New Orleans, Nashville, and most metropolitan   areas of Florida are the most noteworthy examples.
The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to construct a coal   gasification complex valued in excess of one billion dollars in   eastern Tennessee or northern Alabama. This facility is projected to   supply one-third of the TVA region's energy needs by the mid-1980s,   and will be the world's second largest coal-gas plant. The   diversified paper products firm, Kimberly-Clark, which recently   divulged plans to construct a division headquarters and research   facilities near Atlanta, announced an initial construction   commitment of $300 million for a manufacturing plant and   distribution center in the Augusta area. This commitment is the   largest ever in Georgia. In another forest-industry development, the   United Furniture Workers of America made public a plan to relocate   its headquarters from New York City to Nashville. The movement of   most of the furniture industry to the South and lack of unionization   of southern furniture workers are the primary reasons.
Sharply higher feed costs and very low market prices for broilers   and hogs are significantly widening loss margins for most producers.   These losses are causing hog farmers to cut back planned production,   and the number of eggs incubated for broiler chick placements has   declined dramatically. Soybean yields are up this season. Prices   have dropped from early summer levels, but compare favorably with   prior harvests.
