More and more First District respondents are reporting signs of a   recession. Retail sales are soft. Manufacturers generally report   that business is fairly good but "good" seems to have been redefined   over the past few months. Previously it meant that unit sales were   growing, now it seems to mean that sales are holding even with last   year. In the financial sector, loan demand seems to have slowed   slightly although it still remains quite strong. Mortgage money   continues to be available although at high rates--lenders are   rationing by price.
Retail sales in New England are quite weak. There have been   occasional weeks in which sales have been vigorous but these have   been followed by periods in which sales have been very depressed.   The erratic nature of demand is making inventory management very   difficult. The head of a large department store chain with national   ties believes that sales in New England are considerably weaker than   those elsewhere. This same firm is reassessing its expansion plans.
Reports from the manufacturing sector are significantly less gloomy   but respondents no longer question whether we are really in a   recession. Thus, the head of a firm making graphics reports that   business has been quite strong but that he is reevaluating capital   spending plans and reassessing factory schedules in expectation of a   weak first quarter. A large furniture maker notes that attendance at   a major trade show was down 20-25 percent from last year; aggressive   firms fared well, but the weaker companies had very little business.   A manufacturer of building materials also reports that demand has   fallen off. Customers who normally stock up their inventories over   the winter month are not doing so this year. This firm, which sells   heavily to the rehabilitation market, believes that high interest   rates will mean that much less rehabilitation will be done in 1980   than customarily occurs in recessions. Repair and rehabilitation   activity is usually quite strong in recessions as contractors, who   normally prefer new construction, accept less attractive   rehabilitation jobs. Defense contracts continue to be a source of   strength. A number of businessmen report that collections from   customers have slowed.
In the financial sector, banking directors from northern New England   have seen some softening in loan demand, primarily on the commercial   side. However, a large bank from one of the southern states reports   that after leveling off loan demand has picked up again. None of the   business firms contacted was experiencing difficulties in securing   funds. In addition, a survey of small businesses, conducted in the   last two weeks of October by one of the area's large banks, found   that most small firms were still able to get funds at or slightly   above the prime rate. A majority of these firms expect funding to be   more difficult to obtain in the future, but at the present time they   still view inflation as the greatest problem. Home mortgage loans   are still available. Institutions in the region are taking advantage   of the secondary market to secure funds and are allowing the price   to ration demand.
Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, Tobin, Solow and Samuelson were   available for comment this month. Eckstein supports the "new   monetary policy"; however, he believes the aggregates will not be   fully under control until the economy itself is under control. "Having embarked on this course of controlling reserves, we should   see it through, with the proviso that we watch the financial system   closely. With the impending business slump there are risks of   serious financial disturbances, especially for 'second tier firms   Eckstein suspects that the "real crunch has yet to come." He hopes   that the new policy will allow interest rates to fall as rapidly as   they rose when business activity declines in late 1979 and early   1980.
Houthakker is pleased that the Fed is now concerned more about   controlling reserves than controlling interest rates. He believes,   for example, that a 15 percent funds rate is appropriate given   today's market conditions, but the rate should be free to change   when conditions change. He cannot fully endorse the new procedures,   however, until he knows which concept of reserves is now under   control and what reserve target the Fed is trying to achieve.   Houthakker believes we have been in a recession since the beginning   of 1979; the recession will be lengthy, but not deep. He expects the   growth of GNP in the early 1980s will be much like that in the late   1950s--business activity will expand slowly and unevenly. Because   the current consumer price index temporarily exaggerates the true   inflation rate, fiscal and monetary policy could reduce inflation to   7 or 8 percent by the end of 1980 "without undue damage," but the   unemployment rate may have to rise as high as 7.5 or 8 percent. In   any event, Houthakker thinks the eradication of inflation will take   years.
Tobin believes the benefits of the new control procedures have been   exaggerated. Because his research shows little or no connection   between short-term movements in reserves and money aggregates or   total credit, he is not convinced the Fed's control of the money   stock is now more reliable. Tobin believes that there is now a high   probability of a recession in 1980 and that it is dangerous "to keep   tightening until we see the whites of the recession's eyes. We   should get our bearings before embarking on another round of   restraint." The high inflation is not the fault of monetary policy,   in his opinion. If OPEC raises prices again, he hopes the Fed   realizes it cannot costlessly offset the inflationary shock. In the   event of an oil price increase attainment of a satisfactory   unemployment rate and inflation rate is impossible: higher real oil   prices must either depress production or increase domestic   inflation.
Solow has mixed feelings about the October policy. The higher   marginal reserves on banks' "bought funds" is "unambiguously a good   step." He believes the sharp increase in interest rates was   exaggerated, however, perhaps to defend the dollar at the October 6   parity. He is not sure that this particular exchange rate is an   equilibrium rate. He questions whether maintaining the exchange rate   with high interest rates best serves our domestic needs or best   serves the interests of German exporters and German monetary policy,   a policy whose objectives certainly are not very sensitive to our   domestic problems. Before Solow can fully evaluate the new control   procedure, he must see it in action. To the extent that wider   tolerance bands for the funds rate reduce wide procyclical swings in   the money stock, the new policy is to be commended. To the extent   that smoother growth of the aggregates destabilizes GNP and   employment growth, however, the new policy is a "destructive step   backwards." Solow argues that stable money growth may not be   consistent with stable GNP growth; "the Fed needs to take a broad   view in forming policy, especially now that the money demand   function may have come loose at the seams."
Samuelson also has mixed feelings about the new monetary procedure.   Now that interest rates may "float," in theory, the Fed may have   more success in attaining its money targets. In practice, however,   he notes that contemporaneous reserve accounting, among other   reforms, must be adopted before the Fed can achieve this goal.   Samuelson believes there are substantial dangers in any procedure   that has no "safety-valve": the old policy, though it had its   faults, could accommodate shifts in money-demand without disturbing   GNP. Samuelson is worried that the Fed may make stable money growth—rather than high employment with low inflation—the ultimate goal   of policy. Our experience of rising inflation does not prove that   counter-cyclical monetary policy has been a failure, rather it   suggests the trend rate of money growth has been too high. Now that   the consensus forecast anticipates an imminent recession, it is   prudent and rational to avoid further monetary restraint. "If our   goal is zero growth, we have overshot the target, not by accident,   and it is hypocritical to be surprised if we have a recession."
