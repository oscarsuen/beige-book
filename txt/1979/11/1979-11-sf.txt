The tightening of credit caused by the Federal Reserve Board's   policy initiatives of October 6, 1979, has been felt strongly   throughout the Twelfth District. Residential construction and   resales have been particularly affected, with new lending and   building activity off sharply in this area. There have been   repercussions in the District's lumber and plywood industries   despite continued significant non-residential construction activity.   Automobile sales are extremely weak, except in the case of small   (particularly foreign) cars. There are few other signs of weakening   in the economy; retail sales remain quite strong, harvests have been   good, and "boom" industries such as electronics continue to   stimulate labor demand. However, there is widespread uncertainty   about the future, and considerable pessimism about employment   conditions in the near future.
The major change in the economic picture of the Twelfth District   from last month is in the housing and mortgage credit areas. The   prime mortgage rate is as high as 14% and, in many cases, mortgage   money is not available at all. Realtors in most areas report fewer   listings and fewer sales in the resale marker and new residential   construction has fallen off sharply. The usury laws that are in   effect in several states in the District have significantly reduced   new mortgage commitments at savings and loan associations. In   Washington, for example, a 12% usury limit has caused the two   largest savings and loan associations to stop making home loans   altogether.
Commercial construction has not been adversely affected as yet   because of previous construction commitments. Estimates of the   length of the "pipeline" of such activity range from 3 months to a   year. Demand for new commercial and industrial space remains very   strong in the southern California, Portland, Seattle and Salt Lake   City areas. A new 653,000 square foot mall in Salt Lake City, for   example, already has 95% of its lease commitments.
Automobile sales are extremely weak in the District, except among   small foreign car dealers. The high cost of floor credit and   consumer financing is squeezing dealers between increased costs and   reduced demand. One dealer of Cadillacs and Buicks feels as if he is "giving the cars away" in order to reduce inventories and avoid $200   per month flooring costs. Some dealers report "half of normal" sales   volumes in October. There appears to be little interest in the 1980   domestic models.
In contrast to the gloomy picture in automobile sales, retail sales   of soft goods remain strong. A Sears and Roebuck official in Salt   Lake, for example, reports sales "way ahead" of last year. Shopping   malls in Washington report good business volumes as do merchants in   the southern California area. There are signs of caution, however:   Seattle merchants are keeping trim inventories and are going into   the Christmas season with only 75% of traditional inventories.
Industrial production and employment had fallen off primarily in   those sectors affected by developments in the housing and automobile   markets. The plywood industry is reported to be "badly off" and   lumber mills dependent on housing grade studs and dimension lumber   are expected to be hit hard. The Ford Motor Company is laying off   25,000 workers in Los Angeles county in order to work off   inventories. A number of bankers in the District expect small and   medium sized companies to be in trouble in the near future as high   credit costs "reach the bottom line." In the Northwest, the strength   of the aerospace and electronics industry is expected to offset the   weakness in other industries.
There were scattered reports of reduced capital spending in the   District; a major food processing firm, for example, reports holding   back on plans to add to its distribution facilities. However, other   industries report continuing with previous capital spending plans. A   major aluminum manufacturer for example, expects to increase its   rate of capital spending by 25 percent in the next few years. The   primary effect of this activity will be to gain efficiency and   energy savings, however, rather than increase gross capacity.
The agricultural picture in the District is quite bright. Wheat,   apples, and poultry production were reported as being particularly   high. The diary business is indicated to be "strong," with good feed   availability. Seafood prices are currently high, but the effects of   high interest rates on the cost of frozen seafood inventories may   encourage some liquidation of these inventories with concomitant   softening in prices.
The financial markets have displayed a sharp response to the changes   in credit conditions. New non-commercial loan demand is sharply   down. The commercial loan demand picture is mixed; some bankers   report steady demand and other indicate a decline. Similarly, some   lenders report strong deposit outflows and others report no net   outflows but considerable shifting of deposits to interest-sensitive   accounts (MMC's and CD's). There is widespread concern about the   future of lender profitability and some evidence of problems. The   Idaho State Employees Credit Union, for example, will not be paying   a dividend this quarter (for the first time in its history).
A survey of the District's directors indicate that many expect a   reduction in inflation in the near term (several months to a year)   as a result of the new monetary policy initiatives. Most also   forecast a downturn in economic activity in the months ahead.
