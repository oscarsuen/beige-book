Current conditions vary considerably among the Districts. General   characterizations range from ongoing growth in the Minneapolis   District to emerging recession around Boston. Near consensus exists,   however, as to pervasive weakness in the automobile and housing   sectors. Strength persists, nonetheless, in some other manufacturing   sectors, and non-auto retail sales. There is also general agreement   that inventories, in general, across the economy, pose no immediate   problem, although there are underway widespread efforts to pare   current stocks and reduce what have become heavy carrying costs.   Financial market conditions are tending to depress the growth of   loan activity in most districts. Mortgage and automobile lending are   generally weak, but business lending continues to expand moderately,   at least in most regions. In general, loan demand continues buoyant   despite some moderation in its recent growth.
Real personal consumption expenditures are being depressed by the   dearth of automobile sales, but continue to show resilience in other   sectors. Only Boston and Minneapolis see general weakness in retail   sales. Dallas has perhaps the strongest report, with unit sales at   department stores ahead of a year-ago. In several districts sales   continue to advance from earlier in the year despite being down   somewhat, in real terms, from a year ago. Chicago finds consumption   of durables, luxury goods, and services down, while Kansas City   perceives recent strength in sales of appliances, home furnishings,   and energy related home improvement items. In several regions,   however, much of the recent vigor of sales is attributed to   aggressive promotional activity. In the Richmond District, where   sales are up, retailers are preparing promotion programs for an   expected softening in demand.
Most districts report marked slowing in residential construction and   in sales of existing homes. Usury ceilings are cited as a major   impediment in a number of states, but even in the states with no   such restrictions, financial market conditions are not conducive to   vigorous activity in the housing sector. In some areas, notably the   St. Louis, San Francisco, and Atlanta Districts, commercial   construction remains strong, offsetting the weakness in residential   activity. Dallas reports that substantial construction in progress   is propping up the volume of real estate loans outstanding. New   York, on the other hand, finds construction to be "the principal   exception to near-term strength in business activity."
Manufacturing activity is particularly spotty. The automobile sector   is exhibiting pervasive weakness, but there exist definite areas of   strength. St. Louis finds, with the exception of autos, a relatively   high level of manufacturing and particular strength in several   industries including most capital goods, basic metal products,   aircraft, and textiles. Minneapolis reports broadly based strength   in industrial production. Dallas characterizes manufacturing as flat   with weakness in consumer durables being about offset by strength in   nondurables and construction related areas such as primary metals   and stone, clay and glass products. Meanwhile, the Third District is   reportedly five months into a general downturn in manufacturing   activity. Chicago reports high operating rates, but declining order   backlogs at most capital goods producers. The capital goods sector   in the Cleveland District is still experiencing backlogs amidst some   concern that they might soon face reductions in orders. San   Francisco sees most sectors except auto and construction related   ones doing well.
Despite the prevailing level of interest rates, more stringent non-  price lending terms, and tighter credit standards business loan   demand continues to expand in most areas. Funds apparently remain   available to businesses who are taking advantage of that   availability. The most common characterization of business loan   activity is a moderate slowing in the rate of growth. Kansas City   and Atlanta report credit demand dampened by interest rates and   Boston perceives a softening in commercial loan demand, but these   cases appear to be exceptions. Mortgage lending, on the other hand,   seems to be severely and broadly depressed. In regions where   mortgage money is available interest rates and down payment   requirements have increased sharply in recent weeks. Some district   report non-price rationing of funds, while other find some lenders   having withdrawn completely from mortgage lending activity.
Reports on agricultural activity are generally favorable with good   crops and firm prices holding farm incomes up in the Midwest and   plains states and in the Far West. Atlanta, however, reports sharply   higher feed costs and low market prices for broilers and hogs   widening loss margins of producers. Cutbacks in production of hogs   and broilers is resulting. In the Midwest transportation bottlenecks   and inadequate storage facilities are impeding marketing efforts.
