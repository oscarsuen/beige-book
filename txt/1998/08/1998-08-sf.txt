Reports from Beige Book contacts generally indicated a solid pace of overall economic activity in the recent survey period, though with moderation in growth for some sectors.  Retailers reported healthy sales growth, and District service providers noted continued high demand for their products.  Manufacturing activity cooled in recent weeks, damped by declining export demand and a general slowing in the high-tech sector.  District agricultural producers noted that rising inventories and falling prices have squeezed profit margins on many commodities and forced some producers to operate at a loss.   Strong residential and commercial real estate demand continued to fuel construction activity in the District.  Financial conditions remained favorable throughout the District, and competition for quality borrowers intensified.  Respondents continued to be concerned about the tightness of labor markets in their regions.
Service industry respondents in most District states continued to report robust growth.  In California and the Pacific Northwest, demand for telecommunications and cable television services remained high, outstripping supply in some cases and putting pressure on prices.  Tourism-related restaurant sales, car rentals, and hotel occupancy rates were healthy throughout the District, boosted by the beginning of the summer travel season.  Unbalanced trade flows to and from East Asia continue to affect District ports and eastbound shipping prices.  Empty shipping containers are piling up at ports and warehouses throughout the District, while in Asia new containers are being built to meet the demands of their exporters.
Commercial construction activity also was strong in most parts of the District.  Throughout California, respondents reported that commercial office and warehouse space is hard to find and commercial and industrial construction is rising.  In Utah, light-rail and freeway construction continue to boost non-residential construction, which already was active with commercial building.  A respondent from Alaska noted that commercial construction activity is at its highest level since the mid-1980s.  High commercial and residential construction activity in many District states has prompted a "bidding war" for labor and materials, reportedly driving up some project costs by as much as 40 percent.
