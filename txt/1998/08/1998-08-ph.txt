Business activity in the Third District remained at a high level in July, but growth appeared to have eased from the first half of the year.  On balance, manufacturers reported gains,  although fewer firms posted increases in orders than in previous months.  Falling orders from Asia continued to affect the region's goods-producing sector.  According to merchants, retail sales held steady at a good rate, and inventories were falling.  Auto sales have remained strong except for a drop in vehicle sales for strike-bound General Motors.  Bank loans in the District have been steady.  Tourist activity was reported to be very good throughout the District.
Looking ahead, manufacturers anticipate a lower level of activity in the second half of the year than in the first.  Retailers, however, expect sales growth to resume, and auto dealers see no evidence that car buying will ease soon.  Bankers forecast that demand for credit will show little or no change in the months ahead.
Industrial prices for both inputs and products sold edged down, according to the firms surveyed.  Manufacturers cited foreign and domestic competition as well as their own cost-cutting efforts as factors restraining prices.
Looking ahead, area manufacturers forecast slower activity in the second half of the year than in the first.  They expect declines in shipments and orders, and they plan to pare employment.  Although firms in the region plan to increase capital spending on balance in the second half of the year, fewer firms will be boosting outlays than during the first half.
Auto dealers in the region said sales continued to be strong, but General Motors dealers were suffering from a lack of supply as a result of the strike against that manufacturer.  Inventories were said to be near desired levels except for GM vehicles.  Manufacturers have extended their rebate programs, and dealers expect the sales rate to remain at or near the current pace.
