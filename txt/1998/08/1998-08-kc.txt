The district economy continued to grow moderately last month, with no major signs of easing.  Retail sales maintained a strong momentum into the summer, construction activity improved further, and manufacturing activity remained fairly strong.  An exception was energy activity, which was flat.  In the farm economy, corn and soybean crops enjoyed good conditions, while pasture conditions were poor.  Operators of cattle feedlots and hog producers continued to lose money.  Labor markets in much of the district remained very tight, with more evidence of wage pressures than in the recent past.  Prices edged down at the retail level and declined slightly for most manufacturing materials.  In contrast, prices were up slightly for some construction materials.
All respondent banks left their prime lending rates unchanged last month and expect to hold rates steady in the near term.   Most banks held their consumer lending rates constant and anticipate no future changes.   Lending standards were generally unchanged.
