Economic activity remains robust throughout the District.  Contacts are reporting growth in both demand and sales and expect more of the same in the near future.  Tight labor markets still prevail.  Fallout from the UAW strike against GM is being felt at suppliers and other firms around the District.  Several District employers report double-digit increases in health insurance costs for their employees.  Real estate markets, both residential and commercial, are strong:  Sales and prices are up.  Real estate loans at large District banks, however, are down, which, together with consumer loans, have pulled down the total number of loans outstanding.  The District's wheat crop looks to be significantly below last year's production.
The furniture and household appliance industries are being carried along with the real estate wave.  Demand for high-end furniture has grown, but to some degree at the expense of lower end merchandise.  Demand for refrigerators has also increased; it is being met with overtime.  Meanwhile, contacts at various metals firms are reporting sales growth in the range of 10 percent over a year earlier.
Labor disputes have also taken their toll on activity.  Numerous GM suppliers around the District are reporting layoffs because of the UAW strike.  This is the first time that some of these firms have had to layoff workers because of a GM strike.  Unrelated to the GM strike, a maker of filters in Louisville closed its plant after management and UAW workers, on strike since April 1, failed to reach an agreement.  And 530 Steelworkers are striking against an aluminum smelting firm in western Kentucky.  The workers struck in late June; there has been no contract since the union was formed last summer.
