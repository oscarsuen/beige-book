Fifth District economic activity continued to grow at a moderate pace in the weeks since our last report.  Retail sector growth slowed noticeably from its rapid rate earlier in the year, pulled lower in part by softer consumer-durables sales.  In contrast, growth in the manufacturing sector edged up because of solid domestic demand, and the service sector expanded at a more rapid clip.  Real estate activity and bank lending remained strong throughout most of the District.  Labor markets stayed very tight and employers continued to scramble for qualified workers, but wage growth remained generally modest.  Prices of goods and services were little changed.  In agriculture, hot and dry weather stressed crops and reduced yield prospects.
The UAW strike against GM is having an impact in the Fifth District.  Nearly 2,700 workers at a GM plant and 300 at a GM parts supplier in Baltimore, Md., have been laid off.  In North Carolina, a producer of fabrics used in GM automobiles said that his company had asked its employees to take vacations on a rotating schedule in order to avoid layoffs.  In South Carolina, some auto parts producers have begun altering their work schedules and eliminating overtime until a settlement is reached.
Commercial real estate activity remained at a high level, although some contacts noted evidence of a slowdown.  A North Carolina realtor described the market as "static compared to before" with "no major swings one way or another."  In contrast, a South Carolina contact said that the market there was just "humming along," and a District of Columbia contact characterized growth in that market as "brisk," driven by the need for more office space for law firms and telecommunications companies.  Realtors' outlooks for commercial real estate activity were mixed, but most expected no change in market conditions in coming months.
