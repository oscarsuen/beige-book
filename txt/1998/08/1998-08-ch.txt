The Seventh District economy remained quite strong in June and July, though growth was hampered by strikes against General Motors Corporation.  The strikes led to the company shutting down nearly all of its operations in the region, idling tens of thousands of workers.  However, most contacts outside the auto industry reported very limited effects from the strikes.  Consumer spending picked up in July after slower-than-expected sales results in June.  Exceptional strength in the construction industry was rippling through virtually every segment of the economy.  Consumers were buying home furnishings and appliances to stock their new homes and the region's steel and construction equipment producers were running near capacity.  Lending activity remained brisk in June and July, in large part due to very strong home sales.  Labor markets remained much tighter in the District than for the nation as a whole, despite the heavy concentration of GM and its suppliers in the region.  Hog prices dropped below the break-even point for many pork producers and grain prices were pushed downward by the prospect of a large fall harvest.
