The Fifth District economy expanded at a somewhat faster clip in recent weeks despite weather-related slowdowns in some sectors. Consumers continued to spend freely, with retail sales growth out pacing that of a year ago. In addition, manufacturers reported that orders and shipments rebounded sharply from an early winter slumber. Real estate activity, both in the residential and commercial sectors, picked up considerably, although residential builders noted that excessive rainfall reduced housing starts somewhat. Unusually wet weather also kept tourists away from coastal resorts and farmers out of their fields. In the service sector, growth remained healthy, even though the overall pace was held back by a reduction in utilities' sales. Shortages of both skilled and entry-level workers worsened, and reports of higher wages were more widespread. Prices, especially in the service sector, increased at a somewhat faster rate.
Commercial real estate activity picked up dramatically, with one contact noting that "floods of tenants were looking for space." The continued strength surprised some contractors who had "expected themarket to hit saturation by now." Projects underway in the District included small office buildings and larger industrial warehouses as well as retail establishments, a growing portion of which were speculative buildings.
