The Seventh District's economic expansion picked up modestly in January and February, led by increases in consumer spending and housing activity. Some contacts, however, suggested that the unseasonable strength in retailing and housing early in the first quarter may be borrowing from later in the year. Manufacturers continued to operate near capacity and strong new orders showed no signs of softening. Lending activity picked up as many consumers refinanced their existing mortgages. Overall wage pressures remained generally subdued despite very tight labor markets and worker shortages in some occupations and industries. Credit guarantees cushioned any Asian impact on crop exports this winter, but low livestock prices triggered heavy operating losses for many District farmers.
