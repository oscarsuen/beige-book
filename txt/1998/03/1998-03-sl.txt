The District economy continues to generate stable business growth coupled with few signs of rising consumer prices. Retail sales growth met most contacts' expectations, and they anticipate stronger growth this spring. District manufacturing firms are experiencing growth in sales and new orders, while continuing to cope with tight labor markets and moderate wage pressures. A Manpower survey of District firms shows the pace of hiring picking up in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. Unseasonably mild winter conditions supported higher than usual levels of residential and commercial construction and real estate sales in most parts of the District. Loans outstanding at large District banks rose 2.4 percent in the first two months of 1998, compared with a 0.8 percent decline in the same period a year ago. The Asian situation is not yet pulling down cotton exports to the degree that many District producers expect.
Automobile dealers report that sales in January were down an average of 12 percent to 15 percent over the previous year. Several speculated that high levels of consumer debt kept buyers away. More than half of the contacts have been using rebates and incentives more than usual to move stock. In addition, nearly half of the respondents indicate that their current inventories are too high. Dealers remain optimistic, though, that sales will pick up in the second quarter.
Contacts from a variety of District industries report growth in sales and orders. A contact in the furniture industry, for example, reports that industry sales have been high and growing modestly recently. That said, some smaller furniture manufacturers aren't faring well compared with their larger competitors. District auto plants are stepping up production of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, and a tire producer is considering going to seven day (from six), 24-hour shifts to keep up with demand. To cut costs, however, a maker of home appliances will shift production from Kentucky to plants in Georgia and Mexico. In anticipation of costly settlements or lawsuits, tobacco firms are cutting back on workers to preserve profits.
