Business conditions in the Third District in February and early March were mixed but positive overall. Manufacturers reported continued increases in shipments and orders. Retailers said sales were moving up, but auto dealers said sales had eased. Bankers reported some slowing in overall loan demand as lending to individuals declined, but they were generally posting gains in real estate and business lending. Both commercial and residential real estate markets were described as healthy by real estate agents and home builders. Commercial construction was said to be increasing, and residential construction was characterized as steady at a fairly strong rate. Contacts in the retail and real estate sectors cited mild weather as a boost to current activity, but fundamental conditions were also considered to be good, and further gains are anticipated in the spring.
On balance, Third District manufacturers boosted employment in February. Around 20 percent of the firms contacted added jobs in the month; 75 percent held employment steady. Industries with employment increases were textiles, machinery, transportation equipment, and instruments. Employment eased among food processors and producers of primary metals. In other industries, mainly consumer goods manufacturing, employment was steady.
Industrial prices in the region remain nearly steady. More than three-fourths of the manufacturers contacted for this report said the prices of the goods they buy were unchanged from January to February, and nine-tenths said the prices they charge for their products have been level. Some firms said prices of the commodities they use have fallen recently, reducing their input costs, and several firms noted they were installing new equipment to increase production efficiency and reduce operating costs in order to keep output prices competitive.
Auto dealers generally reported a slowdown in sales during February and an increase in inventories except for some popular models. Sales of both cars and light trucks have eased from January's rate. Despite the current slowdown, most of the dealers contacted expect sales to improve this spring.
Much of the slowdown in consumer lending has been in auto financing. Banks have been cautious in lease financing in response to declining residual values. According to some reports, auto manufacturers' finance subsidiaries have taken more of the lease financing business.
