The Twelfth District continued its vigorous economic expansion, though with indications of moderation in some areas. The pace of retail sales was moderate. Both the manufacturing and service sectors experienced continued strong growth, although the restraining effect of the East Asian economic turmoil was evident in several sectors. The District banking and real estate sectors remained healthy overall, with the reports being more positive for California than for other parts of the District. Many respondents noted difficulties finding skilled and entry-level workers, and some reported larger wage increases than in the recent past.
Demand for most services, however, continued to expand very rapidly. Sales were particularly brisk for providers of telecommunications and cable television services. Respondents also noted rising demand for business and professional services up and down the West Coast. Deterioration in the trade balance with East Asia was reflected in reduced exports and increased imports through the ports of Los Angeles, Seattle, and Portland, with some decline in the total flow. Reports from Utah and Oregon indicated reduced tourist activity, and Hawaii's tourism sector has been hit hard by a drop in the number of visitors from East Asia. Southern California contacts reported that tourist business there has been affected somewhat by heavy rains but remains strong overall. Respondents in most areas noted ongoing shortages of information technology workers.
