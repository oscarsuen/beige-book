The Fourth District economy continues to grow, but at a moderating pace. Labor markets are strong and price pressures remain light. Both residential and commercial construction are flourishing, particularly in the central Ohio and Pittsburgh areas.
Temporary employment agencies report increased demand since the beginning of the year, especially for data entry employees and administrative assistants. Historically, the first quarter is a slack season, so the robust activity thus far in 1998 suggests that temporary employment demand for the rest of 1998 will exceed even the high levels seen in 1997.
Many companies report that they are increasingly willing to train unskilled employees, especially those who are willing to learn some computer skills. Some also mention a shift in the composition of those seeking work, resulting in relatively greater numbers of younger (19-21 years), older (65 and over), and less educated (those with only a high school diploma) applicants.
Organized labor reports a small increase in annual wage growth to slightly over 3% per year. Those unions that have not yet seen wage gains expect to see them in the near future. The main focus of current contract negotiations is wages, which the unions are targeting in preference to job security issues. Benefits growth is said to be stagnant, while the trend toward longer contracts has continued into the first part of 1998.
Steel producers report strong growth in orders, but stable raw materials prices have held the product price down. The demand from the auto industry is so strong that some producers report shipping their steel while it is still hot. Asian developments have not had a strong effect on final sales due to healthy domestic demand and long contract lead times associated with exports of higher-performance steel.
January and February auto sales showed strength in the minivan, sport utility vehicle, and truck categories, but were flat for passenger cars. As a result of heavy inventory buildup in the slow months leading to the holidays, dealers have an ample supply of cars. There is some downward price pressure in the used vehicle market because large numbers of 1996 models are being returned fromlease agreements. However, leasing prices are marginally higher as a result of lower residual values.
