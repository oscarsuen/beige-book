The Second District's economy continued to grow briskly in the first two months of 1998. Retailers report that sales were above plan in February, while both selling prices and merchandise costs held steady. The housing market retained momentum in early 1998, following a strong fourth quarter. Commercial rents across most of the metropolitan area have risen rapidly in recent months, as office vacancy rates continued to fall. Regional purchasing managers report a pickup in activity, reduced price pressures for manufacturing inputs, but an acceleration in some labor costs. Finally, local banks report a pickup in loan demand, and a continued modest decline in consumer delinquency rates.
Retail selling prices and merchandise costs were said to be mostly flat, and no increases in wage pressures were reported. Most contacts expect only a modest reduction in merchandise costs as a result of the Asian currency crisis, though one major retailer anticipates "significant savings." All expect to pass along any cost savings to customers in the form of price reductions; these lower-cost products may start to show up on the shelves as early as July, but mostly after Labor Day.
New York State realtors report that existing-home sales were steady in January, running 4-5 percent ahead of a year ago. Prices retreated a bit from lofty December levels, but were still ahead of a year ago by about 4 percent. In general, upstate New York has registered increased volume and steady prices, while downstate has had the reverse. Following a fourth-quarter surge, prices of prime Manhattan co-ops and condos held steady at exceptionally high levels in January, according to a major broker. The average price per room continues to run more than 20 percent higher than a year ago.
Office markets across the New York City area continued to tighten in late 1997 and early 1998. Midtown Manhattan's office availability rate (space coming available in the next six months) edged down from 9.1 percent at year end to 8.9 percent at the end of January; similarly, Downtown's rate slipped from 15.5 to 15.2 percent. Midtown rents continued to rise rapidly in January, running 8percent above year-ago levels; Downtown rents have risen a more moderate 4 percent.
Markets also continued to tighten in the rest of the NYC area, where figures are tallied quarterly. Long Island's vacancy rate tumbled nearly 3 percentage points during the fourth quarter, ending 1997 at an all-time low of 10.6 percent. Vacancy rates fell by roughly a full point in northern New Jersey, Westchester, and Fairfield. In the final quarter of 1997, office rents continued to rise at their trend pace of 6 percent in New Jersey but surged at a double-digit rate in Long Island, Westchester, and Fairfield.
Separately, contacts in various sectors note tight labor market conditions, especially for computer experts, as well as for office support with modest technical abilities. One contact at a leading NYC-area employment agency remarked that "the region's labor market has never been hotter," adding that increased flexibility and efficiency in the labor market are helping to keep a lid on wage inflation.
In New York City, tourism remained fairly robust during the usually slow month of January- hotel occupancy rates (seasonally adjusted) held steady at close to 85 percent, while room rates eased slightly. The local industry expects to get a slight boost from a 23 percent hike in travel stipends for Federal employees traveling to NYC effective January 1. In western New York, Buffalo conventionbookings set a new record in 1997 and look to be even stronger this year, while Niagara Falls reports a sharp increase in conventions booked for 1998 versus 1997.
