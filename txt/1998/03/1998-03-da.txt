Over the past six weeks, Eleventh District economic activity grew at about the same pace as or a little slower than reported in the last Beige Book. Prices of most manufactured products were flat to down while service and construction-related industries continued to report upward price pressures. Manufacturers saw slightly slower sales growth, but retailers reported stronger than expected sales. Consumer borrowing increased with new home purchases, but wet weather slowed construction starts. Service industries reported growth was steady, but constrained by a shortage of labor. Energy activity remained strong but showed some hints of softening. Agricultural conditions remained favorable.
Prices were lower for some petroleum products, memory chips, telecommunications products, and some metals. Crude oil and gasoline prices continued to decline and are lower than last year's levels. Although natural gas prices are higher than a year ago, they have fallen recently, and some contacts expect further declines. Respondents reported that excess domestic capacity for ethylene and propylene, increased imports of polyethylene bottle plastic from Asia, and increased domestic supplies of plastic resins like acrylonitrile, polyvinyl chloride and butadiene resulting from reduced exports to Asia have combined to reduce prices for many petrochemicals. Prices for telecommunications equipment continued a steady downward trend, but most respondents reported an accelerated decline in the price of memory chips as a result of the combined effects of overcapacity and the Asian crisis. Contacts also reported that increased imports from Asia lowered scrap metal prices by 2%, and have put downward price pressure on raw materials such as nickel and ferro-moly alloys.
Prices for retail goods, forest products, and heating oil were flat. Retailers reported that prices of goods imported from Asia did not decline as much as they had expected a few weeks ago, but some retailers expect further price declines in the third and fourth quarters. Apparel industry contacts reported that Asian apparel manufacturers and textile producers have not been able to move swiftly into the United States because they lack the reputations and distribution networks necessary to do so. Paper manufacturers reported limited effects from the Asian markets because Asian-produced paper includes more recycled content than does U.S.-made paper. Heating oil prices were unchanged butwell below year-earlier levels.
Strong construction activity translated into a 5% increase in high-grade steel prices, a 2.5% increase in brick prices, and a slight increase in cement prices. As the weather improves, contacts expect cement prices to rise another 5% and soft lumber prices to increase 10% to 15%.
Service fees increased, but at a slower rate than service wages and salaries. Salaries for engineering and software design were up. Construction wages were also up, but contacts reported that tight margins for builders limited wage increases. Lumber producers reported 10% wage increases. Conversely, the rise in the minimum wage was binding for retailers and apparel manufacturers.
