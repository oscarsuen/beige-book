The First District economy continues to expand. Retail activity has picked up recently in many sectors. Manufacturers' results are mixed, with some contacts experiencing accelerating revenue growth and about half seeing no increase in sales or orders from a year ago. Many respondents report hiring difficulties, and contacts in the temporary employment industry say their revenues areexpanding at double-digit rates. Prices are said to be generally steady. Residential real estate markets are doing well.
Employment is said to be either increasing moderately or holding steady. Half the contacts report tightness in labor markets and corresponding difficulty finding, attracting, and retaining employees. Shortages are reportedly concentrated in high-skill areas; low-skill retail help is ample except in selected small geographic pockets. In most sectors, wage growth has picked up somewhat and is now running at a 4 to 6 percent annual rate. By contrast, in sectors growing only moderately, wages are said to be increasing only 2 to 3 percent.
With one exception, respondents say that prices are holding steady. The exception is tourism, where a continuing shortage of hotel rooms in the Boston area is causing room rates to rise. Vendor prices are also holding steady or, in some cases (lumber and fuel), declining dramatically. Profit margins are increasing slightly. Except for "aggressive expansion" in the tourism sector, contacts indicate they plan to expand capital budgets modestly in 1998.
Manufacturers indicate that most materials costs are flat to down compared to a year ago. They cite reduced prices for copper and oil in particular, as well as greater bargains on components from Asia. Contacts mention that furniture materials costs are rising, however, along with travel costs. Selling prices are largely stable because of flat to declining supply prices, improved production efficiencies, competitive pressures, and retailer resistance. One maker of machine tools recently implemented a price increase, although another lamented that industry prices are far below normal levels because of intense global competition. Computer prices are falling sharply.
Employment trends vary widely among the manufacturers contacted, with roughly one-third implementing layoffs, one-third hiring at double-digit annual rates, and the remaining one-third somewhere in between. Almost all respondents report some hiring difficulties, usually for selected high-skill jobs. Most contacts indicate that average pay is rising 3 to 5 percent. Firms differ in the degree to which they are adjusting compensation packages to deal with labor shortages. In addition, one-half of those facing labor shortages are outsourcing more work and one-quarter report passing up some business opportunities.
Respondents at investment management firms indicate that they have increased employment in recent months and plan to increase employment further, although these increases have been hampered by labor shortages. All respondents report significant difficulty hiring and retaining information technology personnel. Most contacts are implementing targeted wage increases and hiring bonuses for workers in short supply; many are also broadening their recruitment techniques.
