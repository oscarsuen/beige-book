The Seventh District's economic expansion picked up some momentum in April and May, despite significant shortages of labor.  Virtually every economic sector continued to benefit from the extraordinary pace of construction activity.  Consumers were buying appliances and other durables to stock their newly purchased  homes; manufacturers were building earth-moving and other construction-related equipment; and bankers were busy meeting mortgage origination and commercial real estate loan needs.  The District's labor markets tightened considerably since our last report and accounts of worker shortages became more frequent.  Favorable weather in the Midwest allowed spring planting to make rapid progress in recent weeks while hog prices rose due to a seasonal decline in marketings.
