Overall, moderate to strong economic growth continues to prevail in the Ninth District. Construction, retailing and manufacturing are robust.  Tourism shows increasing strength. As in the previous report, areas where agriculture, mining or forestry predominate have much slower economies than the rest of the region.  Crop farmers in particular are under financial stress due to low prices, and there are fears about possible drought in wheat-growing regions.  Reports of increases in wages and in nonwage compensation are becoming more prevalent. Labor markets remain extremely tight in most areas.
Heavy construction, including roads and bridges, continues modestly above 1997 levels.  Extremely favorable weather conditions allowed excavators and road builders to begin somewhat earlier than usual and activity is brisk.
A regional survey of purchasing managers indicates some slowing of exports, particularly in Minnesota and a large commodity trading firm reported reduced profits due to Asian woes.
Farm bankers responding to a Minneapolis Fed survey report that farm incomes and capital spending are slumping, and that there is some erosion in repayment rates.  However, indications such as the number of borrowers against their debt limits remain somewhat better than a year to two years ago when low cattle prices had heavy impacts on western areas of the district.
Sales reportedly are good across most categories of merchandise.  Recreational goods again are singled out as particularly strong.  Auto dealers also describe sales as good, though some express concern about customers becoming "addicted" to rebates, coupons and other promotions that maintain sales but cut into profit levels.  Two sources describe structural change in auto retailing and predict that the number of dealerships will drop precipitously in the next five years.  Sales east of the Missouri River are markedly stronger than in Montana and the western Dakotas.  As with general retailing, sales reportedly are particularly slow in rural areas.
Tourism officials report a strong spring season and good prospects for summer.  Some areas in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan reported 20 percent increases for May compared to a year earlier, while inquiries at a tourism office were up 30 percent year to date. Visitations to Duluth, Minn., were up 10 percent, according to a tourism official.  Tourism sites in South Dakota report steady increases for May; campgrounds were booked full for Memorial Day weekend.
Low commodity and energy prices are helping to hold down the general price level.  Fuel prices that remain below levels that prevailed for most of the decade are helping all parts of the transportation sector.  One source reported price increases for some grades of steel, but another manufacturer described decreases.  A few manufacturers report that delivery times on purchased inputs are dropping and that suppliers apparently have somewhat higher inventories.
