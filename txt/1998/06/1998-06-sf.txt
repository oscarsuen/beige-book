Economic activity in the Twelfth District expanded at a solid clip in the most recent survey period, with strength in housing markets and consumer spending offsetting moderate slowing in manufacturing activity.  District agricultural producers faced poor weather in California and low prices for some products.  Expansion of real estate sales and construction activity was strongest in California, but activity generally remained at high levels in other parts of the District.  Various types of labor remained in short supply in many areas, with additional labor market tightening reported for California.  Upward price pressure was limited overall, but respondents noted significant increases in the purchase price of some services.
Demand for business and consumer services was strong.  Sales of media and cable television services were rapid, and abundant supply kept prices stable.  Recent tourist traffic and hotel occupancy have been high in Southern California; however, hotel bookings for October appear weak there, reportedly due to corporate caution regarding discretionary travel spending.  Respondents noted significant cost and price increases for various services, such as health care, trucking, and eastbound ocean shipping.
