In the weeks since our last report, the Fifth District economy continued to grow moderately, despite a pullback in manufacturing.  Solid growth in personal income underpinned retail growth, and activity remained healthy in the services sector.  Manufacturing stagnated, however, as shipments fell and growth of new orders moderated.  Residential and commercial real estate activity continued to advance, although at a slower pace.  Bank lending edged higher, driven by a pickup in commercial lending activity.  Employers continued to face widespread labor shortages, but wage growth showed few signs of acceleration.  Overall, price growth slowed somewhat in recent weeks, although manufacturers reported a slight uptick in materials prices.
Manufacturers remained concerned about the "Asian flu" impact, especially on the textile and apparel industries.  While the crisis continued to hurt exports, the greatest effect remained increased competition from higher import levels.  Most contacts expected these competitive pressures to rise further in coming months; however, one producer believed that textile quotas would soon be reached, restricting imports during the second half of 1998.
In commercial real estate, growth also showed signs of moderating.  While overall activity remained at high levels, office leasing activity in some areas appeared to be backing off from the hectic pace seen earlier this year; one contact said that in Virginia and West Virginia, activity had "slowed around mid-April and continued to be slower."  However, retail and restaurant space was in greater demand, particularly in Virginia.  In the Carolinas, business relocations were helping to sustain commercial real estate activity.  "Booming" growth was reported for outlying areas of metropolitan Charlotte, N.C., and a contact there noted that the area was receiving "ten times the number of business relocation inquiries" than they had received a few years ago.
Despite these reports, overall wage pressures remained mild.  In the retail and services sectors, only scattered reports of substantial wage hikes were received.  However, in one case, an employer said that her workers were disappointed when they received a 6 percent pay raise, "thinking it would have been more."  Contacts noted that signing bonuses were being offered more frequently, even for entry-level positions.  In addition, employers in areas of low unemployment showed a greater willingness to pay the moving expenses of new hires.
