Most business sectors in the Third District were experiencing continued growth in late May and early June.  Manufacturers' shipments and orders were increasing.  Sales of general merchandise and motor vehicles were on the rise.  Commercial and residential real estate markets were active, and home building continued to be strong.  Despite the continued expansion in business activity, bankers in the region indicated that overall loan volume was just steady.  There were gains in real estate lending but declines in consumer lending, and business lending has been flat.
Looking ahead, area manufacturers expect continued moderate growth in the next six months.  They forecast increases in orders and shipments, but they expect employment to remain close to current levels.  About one-fourth of the surveyed firms plan to increase capital spending, and a few firms noted plans for major expansions of capacity.
Auto dealers in the region generally reported growing sales during May and the first week of June.  Generous manufacturers' incentives were credited for the increase.  Dealers expressed satisfaction with inventory levels.  Although some dealers voiced concern that the current upward trend in sales could soon falter, most were optimistic that sales will remain good as long as overall economic conditions remain positive.
Home builders in the region generally reported a continuing high rate of sales in May.  They indicated that buyers are favoring single homes and townhouses over condominiums and are increasingly contracting for higher-priced options in houses to be constructed.  Average selling prices have increased a few percent from last year, according to builders, who also note that recent increases in the costs of materials and labor have moderated from last year.  Real estate agents said the sales pace for existing homes has been increasing recently.  Many noted that multiple offers for homes have become more common this spring than in the past few years; nonetheless, most said that price appreciation has been slim.
