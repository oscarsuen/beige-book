The district economy last month maintained the strong momentum of the first months of the year, and there appear to be no major signs of substantial slowdown in the near future.  Retail sales repeated a robust performance, construction activity gained further strength, and manufacturing activity remained fairly strong.  Energy activity improved slightly last month from the weak performance poster earlier in the year.  In the farm economy, average to above average yields are expected for the winter wheat crop, and growing conditions for corn and soybeans are excellent.  In contrast, operators of cattle feedlots and hog producers continued to lose money.  Labor markets in much of the district remained quite tight, with some continued evidence of moderate wage pressures.  Prices generally held steady at the retail level and for most construction manufacturing materials.  Prices edged down for most manufacturing materials, with slight increases for a few others.
All respondent banks left their prime lending rates unchanged last month and expect to hold rates steady in the near term.   Most banks held their consumer lending rates constant and anticipate no future changes.   Lending standards were generally unchanged.
