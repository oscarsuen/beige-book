Economic conditions across the District remain exceedingly good.  Retail sales were up modestly in April and May.  Large rebates and other incentives have helped boost car sales from their sluggish start at the beginning of the year.  Other District firms continue to report strong activity, although the construction industry is feeling the squeeze from worker shortages.  Real estate sales and construction are still surging from strong economies and low mortgage rates.  The latest Manpower survey indicates that measurably more firms plan to boost their hiring in the third quarter compared with the second quarter.  Strong demand from business customers has boosted loan demand at large District banks.  Crop conditions are generally viewed as good-to-excellent across most of the District.
Most of the automobile dealers surveyed have strong incentive plans in effect, which are scheduled to last at least through June.  Dealers believe that recent strong sales increases, on the average of 4 percent in April and 5 percent in May over a year earlier, are a result of these incentives.  While most dealers report inventories at satisfactory levels, some are still struggling with inventories that are too large.  Most dealers believe they will have steady sales this summer, with some anticipating strong sales.
Several recent mergers in the District are expected to have wide-ranging employment effects on local economies; however, precise estimates are unavailable.  Jefferson Smurfit bought Stone Container Corp. and will move its headquarters to Chicago.  Monsanto plans to merge with American Home Products and move its headquarters to New Jersey.  The new company plans to keep its agriculture division in St. Louis, however, which could leave employment unchanged or even increase it.  United HealthCare of Minneapolis bought Humana Inc. of Louisville.  United HealthCare believes it may move a division to Louisville, which could increase employment in the region.
