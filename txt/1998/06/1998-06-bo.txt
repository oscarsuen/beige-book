The First District economy continues to expand.  Most contacts in manufacturing, retailing, personnel supply, and even insurance report ongoing growth in revenues.  Selling prices are mostly level, with some input price declines attributed to Asian markets.  Respondents say tight labor markets are still not leading to sizable wage hikes.  Residential real estate markets are doing well throughout New England.
Employment is generally reported to be holding steady on a same-store basis.  Hiring is up, however, because tight labor markets have led to increased turnover and retailers that are expanding operations are raising head counts.  Nonetheless, shortages are reported only for information technology professionals.  Base wage growth is said to be in the 3 to 5 percent range; contacts indicate they are switching to incentive pay systems to keep labor costs down.
Most respondents report that their selling prices are steady.  The exception is tourism in the Boston area, where excess demand for hotel rooms is bidding up room rates; hotel rates in the rest of the region are rising more modestly.  Troubles in Asia are said to have led to declines in some vendor prices, notably for lumber and fuel.  Most contacts say that profit margins are holding steady, with input price declines being offset by wage growth in excess of productivity improvements.  With the exception of tourism, respondents are planning modest capital expansions this year.  Many contacts are investing heavily in computerization, including inventory control systems to improve efficiency.
Looking forward, contacts expect strong sales growth to continue.  Nonetheless, all express some uneasiness about how long the economic expansion can continue.
Almost all manufacturers indicate that materials costs are flat or down.  They report that costs for oil-based products, metals, and wool are lower than a year ago, although two now expect metals prices to recover somewhat.  Manufacturers are paying sharply higher prices for travel and outside programmers, but they say that competition and their own efforts to seek alternative suppliers are keeping a lid on the costs of other services.
With few exceptions, manufacturing output prices are said to be stable.  About one-half of the companies mention downward pressure on prices coming from cost-reduction efforts of customers in the automotive, health care, and office supply industries, declining currency values in Asia, and competition.
Overall employment levels have been fairly stable over the past year for about two-thirds of the manufacturers contacted.  The remaining one-third is split equally between large increases and large decreases.  Some contacts report limited availability and escalating pay scales for selected categories of professional and technical workers.  However, manufacturers do not report widespread difficulties in hiring and they mostly cite overall wage and salary increases in the range of 2 to 4 percent.  A few mention expanded use of incentive-based pay for blue-collar workers.
