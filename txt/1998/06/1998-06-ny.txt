The pace of economic growth in the Second District has picked up since the last report.  Most retailers report that sales continued to run ahead of plan in May, led by home-related goods.  Retailers also report that both selling prices and merchandise costs were flat to down slightly, with one contact anticipating further downward price pressure in the months ahead; no increase was reported in retail wage pressures.  Single-family housing markets in and around New York City tightened further, while New Jersey's remodeling boom has continued unabated.  Office rents in Manhattan rose again at a brisk pace in April, while vacancy rates held steady at a low level.

Tourism remains brisk in New York City and appears to be picking up in western New York State.  Finally, local banks report further declines in consumer delinquency rates and continued moderate growth in loan demand.
Retail selling prices and merchandise costs were steady to down slightly.  While most retailers report only modest cost savings on Asian imports, one contact notes that reduced-price electronics from Asia are now reaching the store shelves, and that apparel prices are expected to decline noticeably beginning in August.  While there were no reports of significant wage pressures or increased labor shortages, a number of contacts express concern about recruiting and retaining staff during the peak hiring season in late autumn.
The multi-family sector, which is also reported to be strong, may have reached a plateau.  Permits to build apartments continued to retreat from exceptionally strong 1997 levels; year-to-date, they are down nearly 40 percent.

However, vacancy rates in both areas, which had been trending down since mid-1996, have leveled off in recent months.
