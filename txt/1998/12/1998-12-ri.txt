The Fifth District economy continued to expand at a moderate pace in the weeks since our last report. Many firms in the service sector reported a pullback in revenues, but manufacturing output rebounded after several months of decline. Retailers reported somewhat higher sales in November and a good start to the holiday sales season, despite unseasonably warm weather which damped enthusiasm for winter apparel. Real estate activity picked up; commercial developers were particularly upbeat in light of the rebound in the stock market. Loan demand was strong and lending was brisk at District banks. In labor markets, wages grew moderately and worker shortages persisted, despite continued declines in District manufacturing employment. Fair weather in late October and November boosted tourism, but brought little relief to moisture-starved crops and pastures.
Commercial real estate activity picked up in recent weeks, driven higher by a rebound in stock prices and consumer confidence. Realtors in both West Virginia and North Carolina noticed that a growing proportion of doctors, engineers, and attorneys were buying their offices rather than leasing. The exodus of these professionals combined with new product coming on line contributed to an increased availability of Class A space in these areas. In contrast, realtors in Maryland, Washington, D.C., and South Carolina expressed growing concern about shortages of available space.
