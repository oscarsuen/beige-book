The Fourth District economy shows mixed growth patterns. While business activity remains very strong in several industries, including construction, export-sensitive areas, such as agriculture and basic materials manufacturing, report a significant drop-off in sales and prices. Temporary employment agencies report a continued strong demand for labor, and most remain unable to fill all vacancies. Skilled office and service industry workers are in especially high demand, resulting in added upward wage pressure.
Unions report that wages are increasing in the 3% to 4% range, up from the 2% to 3% range seen in 1997. Some unions have indicated heightened concern over job security due to fierce foreign competition. Still, organized labor sources in the District continue to report shortages of skilled labor, particularly in the construction trades. Construction activity in the District is unusually brisk for the season, although the majority of respondents believe that speculative building has been on the decline. Residential building-cost increases were reported for land and, marginally, for labor. One contact estimated the growth in land prices approximately 10% for the year, compared with an estimated 3% to 5% for materials and labor. The labor market continues to be relatively tight, but increased availability of commercial masonry contractors was noted. Residential builders continue to report difficulty securing subcontractors and report upward pressure on subcontracting costs.
The District's corn harvest is abundant and ahead of schedule, with yields expected to be about 10 bushels per acre higher than last year, or about 8% above their average yield of the past five years. Projections for the soybean harvest are strong in Ohio and Pennsylvania, but in Kentucky, where weather has been considerably drier, farmers anticipate their lowest yield since 1988. Some farmers are plowing under their poor soybean yields or harvesting them for silage.
Prices for most agricultural commodities are much lower compared to a year ago. In particular, corn and soybean prices have fallen 20% to 25% from 1997.
Sources in the transportation and shipping industries, now entering the heavy holiday season, report a moderation in traffic since earlier in the year. Nevertheless, shipping activity remains high and domestic freight prices are holding steady. Container traffic from Asia, although still very strong, has leveled off somewhat from its seasonal peak of last a month. Export activity remains weak.
