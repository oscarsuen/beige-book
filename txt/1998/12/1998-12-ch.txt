The Seventh District economy remained strong in October and November, although pockets of softness persisted. Retailers were generally satisfied with Thanksgiving weekend sales results as traditional gift items sold well. Home sales remained strong and builders' expectations for the new year were buoyed by Federal Reserve actions to cut interest rates. Manufacturing activity was generally high despite further softening in some key industry segments. Bankers remained somewhat cautious amid continued strong demand for both business and consumer loans. Midwest labor markets were much tighter than the nation as a whole and retailers were finding it harder to fill seasonal positions than a year ago. District farmland values dropped slightly during the third quarter, the first quarterly decline since 1986. Hog producers again sustained losses from sharply lower prices while dairy farmers continued to benefit from high milk prices.
District hog producers continue to sustain losses. Cash hog prices in the Midwest trended lower and in late November were 60 percent below a year earlier. The sharp price decline was spurred by record-large hog marketings and tight packer capacity. In contrast, dairy farmers continued to benefit from record-high milk prices.
A survey of agricultural bankers in the Seventh District indicated that farmland values registered a decline of 1 percent during the third quarter, the first such decline since 1986. Moreover, a majority of the respondents expect another decrease during the fourth quarter. Bankers also stated that the pace of loan repayments was slower than a year ago and that requests for loan renewals and extensions were up. Although bank contacts indicated that most of their farm borrowers are in good financial shape and able to weather the current downturn, they expressed concern over the financial performance of hog producers and the duration of low commodity prices.
