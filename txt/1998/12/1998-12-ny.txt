Economic growth in the District has been mixed but, on balance, stronger than in the last report. Most retailers report brisk sales in the last weekend of November, though retail sales for the month were generally below plan, mainly due to warm weather; discounters continued to out-perform department store chains. The housing market strengthened across most of the region in recent weeks, though sales of high-end Manhattan co-ops and condos were soft. New York City's office market remains tight while vacancy rates have leveled off, rents continue to rise at a double-digit rate. Although the market for commercial properties in New York City continues to be somewhat hampered by credit tightening among lenders, most new projects (including three major hotels) are going forward.
Despite more layoff announcements on Wall Street, the local job market remains generally firm. Regional surveys of purchasing managers indicate a general pickup in manufacturing activity in October and November, along with continued brisk growth in non-manufacturing sectors. Finally, local banks report a further pickup in loan demand, tightening credit standards, and steady delinquency rates.
Virtually all contacts say that unseasonably mild weather in the Northeast depressed sales of outerwear and various cold-weather accessories (antifreeze, heating devices, etc.); however, other categories, such as home goods, toys, electronics, and intimate apparel sold well in November. Inventories are said to be in good shape, with the overhang in winter-related merchandise expected to dwindle with the next cold snap. Retail selling prices and merchandise costs were steady to down slightly, with prices for apparel (largely from Asia) generally lower than a year ago. Retailers report difficulty in staffing, with one contact describing it as "brutal"; however, most contacts say it is not much different from last year's holiday season and none reports significant wage pressures.
New York State realtors report that sales of existing single-family homes were brisk in October, rising 15 percent above year-earlier levels, while prices jumped 11 percent. The biggest price rises were downstate especially in the lower Hudson Valley. Prices also rose in the Rochester area, and sales activity strengthened noticeably across most of upstate New York. A leading Manhattan brokerage reports that buyer traffic for prime Manhattan co-ops and condos rebounded from September's sharp slump; however, in October and November, actual sales were roughly 30 percent lower than a year ago, while new listings were up substantially, and selling prices stabilized well below this summer's peak levels. The weakness is attributed to concern about Wall Street layoffs and related income losses.
Manhattan's office market remains exceptionally tight; although vacancy rates held steady at low levels again in October, rents continued to rise at a double-digit pace. However, with commercial lenders tightening credit, some buyers have reduced bids on office properties and a number of deals have been put on hold. Still, an industry expert notes that most commercial developers are going ahead with projects, including the construction of three large hotels, which are due to be completed in 2000.
Regional purchasing managers' surveys indicate some pickup in manufacturing activity in October and November, along with particular strength in non-manufacturing sectors. Buffalo purchasing managers report sturdy growth in manufacturing activity in both October and November. New York purchasing managers report a slowdown in the manufacturing sector in November, following brisk growth in October; growth in non-manufacturing sectors remains strong.
