District contacts, while still reporting tight labor markets in their communities, are seeing some moderation in the rate of economic growth. Retail contacts expressed satisfaction with November sales activity and are generally optimistic about the holiday season. The latest Manpower survey suggests a slight pullback in hiring plans for the first quarter of 1999 compared with a year earlier. Housing markets remain strong, although growth in new construction has been waning. Nonresidential construction has slowed across the District. While loan demand remains strong at large District banks, several bankers report a modest tightening of loan standards for corporate borrowers. Farm sector contacts report that low commodity prices have significantly pared sales of farm machinery and agricultural chemicals compared with a year earlier.
Automobile dealers said sales growth was about 5 percent on average for November when compared with a year earlier. Almost all of the dealers indicated that they are currently, and plan to continue, using sales incentives, and most are content with their current inventory levels. Some dealers are very optimistic about sales in the first quarter of 1999 but, in general, dealers anticipate only modest sales growth.
