Economic activity in the First District is generally expanding, but at a slower pace than in the first half of the year. Prices are reportedly stable or falling. Labor markets remain tight and firms in the region mostly report they are not adding to their work forces, except seasonally.
With the exception of tourism, respondents report that consumer prices and vendor prices are holding steady. The fast pace of inflation in hotel room rates is expected to end in 1999, as new hotel construction will ease current room shortages. Lumber prices are reported to be declining. Most contacts say profit margins are holding steady. Respondents report that recent capital expansions have been completed and they do not plan any additional expansions over the next six months.
Looking forward, retail contacts are cautiously optimistic for the holiday period, but report a great degree of uncertainty concerning the outlook for 1999. Most expect the current expansion to continue in 1999 but at a markedly slower pace.
Most manufacturers indicate that both their materials costs and their selling prices are either stable or falling. The most notable downward price pressures are in textiles (because of competition) and automotive and aircraft parts (because of pressures from major customers). However, about one-quarter of the respondents plan to raise prices modestly because of rising costs for components or labor.
Contacts mostly report that their U.S. employment is flat or down (in about equal numbers) relative to a year ago. Hiring is concentrated on engineering, information systems, purchasing management, technical sales and service, and other professional and technical fields. Average wage and salary increases are mostly in the range of 2 to 6 percent.
About one-quarter of the respondents have reined in capital spending because of concerns about business trends. Others are maintaining their investment programs and typically cite factors such as a need to improve efficiency, become Y2K-compliant, or introduce new production or information technologies. Most manufacturers express a somewhat cautious view of their business prospects for 1999, but they cite examples of "silver linings" as well as "clouds." Some firms that expect revenue gains predict flat earnings because of escalating labor costs, while others express confidence that they have taken actions that will enable earnings to continue to grow.
The rest of New England is mixed. Office vacancy rates in Greater Hartford are the lowest since 1989, but still the highest in the Northeast; rental rates for retail space have risen slightly, but the industrial sector has high vacancies and unchanged rental rates. New Haven and Stamford are doing very well, with low office vacancy rates and office rental rates up 12 percent in 1998; apartment vacancy rates are very low as well. Maine has seen a rise in office and retail vacancy rates during the past quarter. Rhode Island has a very strong industrial market, but little activity in its office market.
Contacts anticipate the Boston market will remain strong; the Greater Boston economy is sufficiently diversified to absorb any space that might be vacated by declining sectors of the economy. Vacancy rates in Hartford, however, may rise because of consolidation in the financial sector.
