Reports from Beige Book contacts indicate a moderate pace of economic growth in most 12th District states during this survey period. Retailers reported modest sales growth in recent months, while service providers in the District noted an acceleration in growth above an already rapid trend. Manufacturing activity slowed further in recent weeks, damped by declining demand for exports and inventory imbalances in the high-tech sector. District agricultural conditions remained weak, as below average yields, low quality harvests, and soft prices continued to depress profits. Residential and commercial real estate activity was healthy, although higher financing costs have tempered growth. District banks reported increased demand for loans, as borrowers searched for alternative financing tools. Looking forward, respondents remain concerned about future financial and economic developments, although their view has improved since the last survey period.
Service industry respondents in most District states reported strong growth. Demand for telecommunications, data communications, and cable television services picked up in recent weeks, producing material shortages and delaying deliveries in some regions. However, prices for most telecommunications and cable products remained stable due to stiff competition among providers. Demand for shipping and freight services also increased in many District states, as producers and retailers prepared for the holiday season. Strong import growth during the recent survey period kept port traffic at high levels throughout the District and pushed inbound cargo charges up significantly; two contacts reported that container rates for inbound cargo have risen by as much as 50 percent in the last year.
