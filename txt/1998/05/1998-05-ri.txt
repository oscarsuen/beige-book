The Fifth District economy expanded at a moderate pace between early March and late April.  Service sector revenue growth quickened, led by real estate and air transportation firms; and retail sales growth, after pausing in March, resumed in recent weeks.  Although Asian economic problems trimmed export sales for some manufacturers, overall demand facing the sector remained solid.  Residential and commercial real estate activity trended upward and builders nearly got back on schedule following earlier rain delays.  Bank lending remained brisk for most loan categories.  Labor markets continued to be tight; more employers raised wages to attract and retain qualified workers.  Prices of goods and services changed little.
Several manufacturers told us that the financial crisis in Asia had reduced their sales.  A producer of machinery and equipment said his company had suffered a 20 percent reduction in exports to Asia in recent weeks, and an electrical products producer had curtailed shipments to Korea because his customers there were having difficulty securing credit.  Domestic sales fell for a textile producer in North Carolina, who explained that, despite having state-of-the-art equipment, he couldn't compete with cheaper Asian labor.
On the commercial side, a real estate contact described activity as "trucking right along" with slight increases in construction and more talk of new deals.  In the Washington, D.C. area, both build-to-suit and speculative building activity accelerated.  Several areas also experienced slight increases in retail construction, especially for restaurants.  Investor interest in new office construction remained high; commercial real estate contacts indicated that "a lot of people," including some from abroad, were "looking for investments" and there was "a lot of money" chasing deals.
