The Twelfth District economy grew at a strong pace in the most recent survey period, although reports indicate moderate restraining effects from East Asian economic developments.  Consumer demand for retail products expanded at a solid pace, and sales of business and consumer services were brisk.  Most manufacturers continued to operate at or near capacity, despite noticeable declines in exports to East Asia in several sectors.  Construction activity and real estate markets remained vibrant, particularly in California.  Banking conditions were very healthy.  Upward price pressure increased noticeably for some services but remained minimal for manufactured goods.
Sales of business and consumer services continued at a brisk pace, with particularly strong reports for media and communications services.  Advertising sales grew rapidly in Oregon, with double-digit revenue increases reported for radio and television companies, and local providers of cable television saw strong demand.  Southern California's hotel and tourist sector posted very healthy sales.  Few supply constraints were reported among service providers.  However, respondents noted capacity constraints for truck and rail transportation in some areas, and a buildup of containers occurred at the Port of Los Angeles, due to a growing excess of imports over exports.  In addition, providers of health services faced rising cost pressures.
