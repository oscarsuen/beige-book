The Seventh District economy continued to expand moderately in March and April, with few signs of slowing growth.  Consumer spending remained robust with much of the strength resulting from exceptional activity in housing markets.  The manufacturing sector continued to operate near capacity with strong new orders and lean inventories, although makers of high-tech electronics experienced considerable softening as a result of weakness in East Asian markets.  Overall lending activity was brisk through the reporting period with the consumer segment exceeding most bankers' expectations.  Labor markets tightened further and reports of wage increases, though modest, became more frequent.  Spring planting was slowed by rain and wet soil in April, but most farmers were not significantly behind schedule.
