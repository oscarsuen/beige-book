The Ninth District shows little change from earlier in the year.  The economy is growing moderately in most urban areas and strongly in some.  But increasing weakness in farming and other natural resource sectors is casting a pall over spending in rural areas, particularly in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.
Urban economic activity shows little change from the previous report.  Construction appears indefatigable in most areas, despite a few anecdotal reports of softening.  Manufacturers remain generally busy, though a few small layoffs were announced.  General merchandise and apparel sales continue strong.  Bank lending remains aggressive and there may be some erosion of underwriting standards. Labor markets continue tight and price increases for goods or services, low.
Change is most visible in the natural resource sectors.  Agriculture, where farmers are suffering financial stress from recent price declines, is the most sharply negative component in the district economy.  But there is also slowing in oil and gas development and mining.  In addition, tourism remained weak in most areas through the first quarter of 1998.
The only brightness in farming seems to be in Wisconsin, where recent milk prices are higher than in late 1997.  And concerns about reservoir levels and soil moisture in Montana and western North Dakota have been alleviated by late winter snows and rain in April.
Vehicle sales remain sluggish in Montana and the Dakotas, as they generally were through the first quarter.  Minnesota and Wisconsin dealers describe sales as so-so.  "I thought we would get more help from low gas prices," says one dealers' association representative.
"Tourism plunges in Flathead Valley," was the headline for a Montana newspaper article about the effects of the mild winter on ski resorts in that area.  Overall, winter recreation businesses had a disappointing season, but owners are generally optimistic about the spring and summer, citing warm weather for early outdoor activities and low gas prices as favorable factors.
Employers continue to report difficulty in hiring qualified workers, but a few sources report some easing from mid-winter in a still-strained market.  One small computer service firm noted that it had three times as many applicants for an advertised position as it had for an identical one nine months ago.  "The century date hiring frenzy is over," he reports, "Companies either have the people they need, or they are not going to do anything."  One  St. Paul, Minn., fast food franchisee also reports easier hiring than throughout 1997.
Gasoline and other petroleum products remain low in price, about 10 percent below year-earlier levels.  Prices of energy-related fertilizers such as anhydrous ammonia are below 1997 planting season levels.  Manufacturers report little or no increases in the prices of intermediate goods or other inputs; some who source components in Asia report decreases.  Prices also seem dormant at the consumer level where lower pork prices in late winter and spring are helping hold down grocery bills.  Imported apparel prices reportedly also are trending slightly downward.
