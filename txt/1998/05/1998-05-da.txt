In March and early April, Eleventh District economic activity grew at a slightly slower pace than in January and February. Most contacts remained optimistic about the outlook for economic growth, although some expressed increased caution about their forecast over the next few months. Demand continued to increase for business service firms, and retailers reported good sales. Financial service contacts reported stable loan demand. Construction activity continued to strengthen, boosted by strong commercial and home building and "hectic" real estate activity. Manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace than reported in the last beige book, mostly due to weaker sales to Asia. Energy activity was softer, with a strong shift away from oil-directed drilling. Agricultural producers continued to report favorable conditions.
Labor markets remained tight in many industries and for many types of workers, although wage increases remained mostly limited to the service sector. More employers are using training programs, so they can hire workers who previously were considered unqualified to meet their labor needs. Contacts in the service sector said a lack of workers has limited businesses' ability to meet increasing demand.
