The district economy continued to grow moderately last month.  Retail sales were robust, construction activity improved further, and manufacturing activity remained fairly strong.  The only sign of weakness was a continuing decline in energy activity.  In the farm economy, the winter wheat crop was in good condition and feedlots were operating at or near full capacity.  Labor markets remained quite tight in much of the district, with continued evidence of moderate wage pressures.  Prices generally held steady at the retail level and for construction materials.  Price changes were mixed for manufacturing materials, with slight increases for some materials and declines for others.
All respondent banks left their prime lending rates unchanged last month and almost all expect to hold rates steady in the near term.  Most banks held their consumer lending rates constant and anticipate no future changes.  Lending standards were generally unchanged.
