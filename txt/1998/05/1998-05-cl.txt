Conditions in the Fourth District continue to be strong.  Both residential and commercial construction remain healthy throughout the District, with high activity in Columbus and Pittsburgh.  District bankers do not detect any extraordinary speculation in the real estate market.  Price pressures for goods and services are generally slight.
Temporary agencies report great difficulty in finding workers.  Metropolitan agencies have a particularly high demand for administrative assistants and other high-end clerical workers, while suburban firms are experiencing a shortage of general laborers.  In addition to the traditional want ads, agencies are recruiting at churches, job fairs, colleges, and state employment agencies.  All say that wages have risen, with estimated increases ranging from 5% to 20%. Retailers, pressed to find qualified individuals at all skill levels, have changed their incentives and recruiting procedures to attract new employees.  Some manufacturers report a long-term problem in hiring people with a strong electronics background.
Organized labor is seeing modest increases (averaging about 3% to 3.75%) in annual wage growth for skilled manufacturing and government workers.  There have been no increases in employee benefits; in fact, some firms are shifting a larger share of premiums to employees.  Job security continues to be a high concern for unions, whose success in obtaining more job security provisions and longer contracts has been mixed.
In general, conditions in the chemical industry are good.  Most companies are doing well in year-over-year terms, and they expect sales to continue improving in 1998.  Several of them have recently expanded their capacity.  Many companies are feeling the effects of the currency crisis in Asia, where aggressive pricing is increasing competition for manufacturers of chemical raw materials, while benefiting companies who use these materials to manufacture more specialized chemicals and plastics.  Companies with less exposure to the Asian crisis tend to be more confident about the future.
March and April sales of vehicles have offset a slight weakness in January and February.  Most dealers report a significant year-over-year increase in new vehicle sales.  Their supply of key vehicles remains a problem, because sports utility vehicles, pickups, and some minivans are still selling fast, as are used vehicles.  As a result of these strong sales, manufacturers' incentives, such as low interest rates or cash back, have tapered off slightly from their previous high levels.  Most dealers expect sales in the coming months to be up significantly from the same period last year.
