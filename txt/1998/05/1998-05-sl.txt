The District economy continues to operate at a high level.  District contacts, while still having trouble finding qualified workers because of tight labor markets, also report relatively strong growth in their industries and firms.  Despite heightened upward pressures on wages, attempts to raise prices have been largely unsuccessful.  The solid economy and low mortgage rates are leading to a housing boom in most parts of the District.  Housing sales, construction and prices are up.  Loan demand remains relatively strong at large District banks.  The District's winter wheat crop looks to be in good-to-excellent condition in most areas.  Recent rains, however, have slowed spring tillage and planting activities.
A contact in the poultry processing industry reports that production will likely be slowed moderately to allow inventories to shrink somewhat.  Inventories had been building in part because of sharply lower pork prices.  Several steel manufacturers have noted a huge influx of foreign steel recently, especially from Asia, which will likely drive down the price of their finished product.  Similar reports have been heard from the automotive industry.  A contact in the chemicals industry reports that softness in Asian markets has cut exports about 40 percent, which translates into about a 12 percent decline in total sales.
Auto parts manufacturers are increasing production because of rising demand, mostly associated with the soon-to-open Toyota plant in southern Indiana.  In addition, Toyota has already announced that it will double the size of this plant and hire an extra 1,000 workers on top of the 1,300 already scheduled to work there.  Elsewhere, call centers and telemarketing firms are adding workers as more companies outsource this function.
Monthly residential construction permits were up in half of the District's 12 metropolitan areas in February.  So far this year, permit levels in seven District metro areas are up over last year, rebounding from mild declines in 1997 relative to 1996.  Construction of multifamily housing, especially apartment complexes, remains strong in some southern parts of the District.  Markets for office and retail space are becoming even tighter in the major metropolitan areas, as vacancy rates continue to decline.
