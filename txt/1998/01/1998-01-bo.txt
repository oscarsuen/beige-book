Employment is said to be either increasing               moderately or holding steady. Most contacts report that labor markets               were tight during the holiday hiring period, with employers encountering               difficulty in finding, attracting, and retaining employees. Permanent               staff levels appear to be holding steady, with highly skilled computer               programmers being the primary occupation with shortages. Among retailers               reporting tight labor markets, half are offering wage premiums as               one device to hire and retain help, although one contact said such               premiums were ineffective. In general, wages are said to be increasing               at a 3 to 5 percent annual rate, with selective premiums adding               another 5 to 10 percent for specific individual employees.

Contacts generally believe the U.S. economy               remains in good shape, with several citing accelerating domestic               demand for their products. Most exporters indicate that they have               not yet felt a decline in sales volume as a result of the Asian               crisis. However, they have downgraded their projections for sales               to Asia and they expect to face stiffer competition from Asian firms               in other markets.
