Employment is said to be either increasing               moderately or holding steady. Most contacts report that labor markets               were tight during the holiday hiring period, with employers encountering               difficulty in finding, attracting, and retaining employees. Permanent               staff levels appear to be holding steady, with highly skilled computer               programmers being the primary occupation with shortages. Among retailers               reporting tight labor markets, half are offering wage premiums as               one device to hire and retain help, although one contact said such               premiums were ineffective. In general, wages are said to be increasing               at a 3 to 5 percent annual rate, with selective premiums adding               another 5 to 10 percent for specific individual employees.

Contacts generally believe the U.S. economy               remains in good shape, with several citing accelerating domestic               demand for their products. Most exporters indicate that they have               not yet felt a decline in sales volume as a result of the Asian               crisis. However, they have downgraded their projections for sales               to Asia and they expect to face stiffer competition from Asian firms               in other markets.
Manufacturers indicate that most materials               costs are flat to down. Costs rose a little at the beginning of               1998 for some grades of paper but held steady for others. Travel               costs are said to be increasing. Selling prices are largely stable.               Manufacturers have implemented small increases for selected paper               products and for fabricated metal products that are in short supply.                                           Employment is holding steady at about three-quarters of the manufacturers               contacted while increasing substantially at the remainder. Average               pay is said to be rising at a rate of 3 to 6 percent. Manufacturers               indicate that markets continue to be very tight for specialized               technical and professional personnel, with double-digit pay increases               in some categories such as engineering. A few report rising turnover               or greater challenges in recruiting blue-collar workers, although               most remain satisfied with availability.
Respondents at insurance companies report increases in revenue in               the range of 5 to 10 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared               to the fourth quarter of 1996. New sales at life insurance companies               continue to be driven by variable products linked to the stock market.               A few contacts mention increased downward pressure on premiums relative               to claims for group health and commercial property/casualty insurance.               Several insurers reduced their employment in 1997 while others intend               to do so in 1998. Respondents note continued difficulties in finding               information technology specialists but some indicate that wage pressures               in this field were lower than could be expected.
