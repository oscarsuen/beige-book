In December and early January, Eleventh District economic activity grew at a slightly slower pace than reported in the last Beige Book. While prices of most manufactured products were flat or down, services and some construction-related industries saw price increases. Manufacturing and retail firms reported slightly slower sales growth, while service industries said sales growth was up.Most contacts anticipate- but have not seen-effects from the Asian crisis; a few attributed recent price and sales declines to the situation. Energy and construction activity remained strong. Loan demand was unchanged, and agricultural conditions remained favorable.
Prices of poultry, feed grain, beef, pork loin, pine lumber, memory chips, crude oil and refining products were reported to be down. A few retailers reported they are also seeing lower prices for a variety of Asian imports. Contacts attributed much of the decline in memory chip prices to worldwide excess capacity, but also believed events in Asia played a role. Contacts reported crude oil prices were hit hard by unseasonably mild weather, the resumption of Iraqi oil sales, and expectations of a decline in Asian demand. Crude oil prices, which averaged $21 to $22 per barrel in October, slipped to about $17 by early January. Retail gasoline, heating oil and natural gas prices were also reported to be down.
Prices of primary and fabricated metals, plastics, petrochemicals, telecommunications products, and paper were generally flat. Petrochemical prices held steady despite the addition of three ethylene facilities over the past month because strong construction activity in late 1997 depleted inventories of construction-related plastic products and the petrochemicals from which they aremade.
Prices increased over the past six weeks for fruits, vegetables, some processed foods, hardwoods, brick and cement. Food industry contacts reported prices rose because of a cold snap which knocked out 80 percent of Mexico's crops. Contacts reported that high levels of construction activity led to increased cement prices and shortages of skilled workers in construction and construction-related industries. Brick and hardwood lumber producers said wage increases fed through to product price increases of 2 percent to 3 percent since the last survey.
Service-producing contacts reported increases in prices in the past six weeks. Passenger airlines reported unusually high demand for the post-Christmas season, with record load factors and an 8-percent fare increase. Service sector growth translated into increased recruiting of skilled and semiskilled workers, higher compensation, and in most cases, higher prices, although there were some reports of squeezed profit margins.
