The Seventh District economy continued to expand moderately as               the old year ended and the new year began. Consumer spending over               the holiday season ended up in line with most retailers' expectations,               despite unseasonably warm weather hindering the sale of some seasonal               items. The normal seasonal slowdown in the region's construction               activity was less pronounced than in the past, with December's warmer               weather allowing more projects to be started. Manufacturers' plants               continued to run near capacity, although new orders appeared to               soften slightly in some industries, in part reflecting developments               in Asia. Business lending activity remained brisk, and mortgage               refinancing activity picked up noticeably as interest rates continued               to fall. Shortages of skilled labor persisted in most areas and               there were new reports of some projects being canceled as a result.               Prices for most key Midwest farm commodities have declined considerably               in recent weeks, adding to the likelihood of lower farm sector earnings               in 1998.
The turmoil in Southeast Asia has begun to filter through the               manufacturing sector since our last report. Heavy equipment producers               appeared to be influenced most directly, with exports to the region               falling off noticeably. One producer described the Asian market               as "a disaster," as the company's sales to the region were cut nearly               in half. The District's automakers expressed some concern that competitors               from Southeast Asia would increase the use of incentives in the               U.S., though there were few reports of this taking place recently.               This would further soften the pricing environment for the industry.
