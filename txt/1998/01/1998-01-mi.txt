As 1998 opens, the Ninth District economy is like a marathoner - maintaining a strong, steady stride, but not sprinting. Business people are optimistic about prospects for the new year. Construction, manufacturing and energy development are all robust. Retail sales were strong at the end of 1997, and merchandisers are generally optimistic about 1998. Banks enjoyed a very good year and anticipate another.
Agriculture varies somewhat by crop and location, but farm finances are generally strong. Due to lack of snow, tourism is weak in some areas. Difficulty in securing employees is the most widespread economic complaint. Despite reports of rising wages for many specific skills, output prices are quiescent.
Housing construction is strong in most urban areas. Many sources report that low interest rates are heating up buyer interest in both new and existing housing, and lenders are bracing for a spate of refinancing.
Wheat and dairy producers are squeezed by prices that do not allow them to cover all costs. North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota farmers continue to suffer poor cash flows due to 1997's excess moisture, plant disease and insect infestations that cut yields dramatically in many areas. Despite these problems, farm finances are described as strong by most district bankers.
Vehicle sales are mixed. Dealers and association representatives in Montana and the Dakotas describe sluggish to average sales in many areas. But sources in urban areas of Minnesota, western Wisconsin and the eastern fringes of North Dakota and South Dakota are somewhat more optimistic, reporting good, but not booming, sales.
"No white means no green," is a headline that applies to most winter recreation or tourism businesses. A tourism official reports that the lack of snow has hit some counties hard in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, especially during the holidays. "It will take a lot to bail out the winter," he says. While snow cover is light on the lower elevations in South Dakota and Montana, there are good conditions at higher elevations. A ski resort in Montana reports a solid holiday season and projects a season on par with last year.
Gasoline and heating oil prices are at their lowest levels in this decade. Spot natural gas prices declined from December into the new year. The combination of lower prices and warm weather has significantly reduced heating costs for most homeowners. Manufacturers of intermediate goods continue to describe pressure from customers to lower prices. Reports of price increases for intermediate or final goods are extremely rare.
