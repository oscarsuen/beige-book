The district economy continued to grow moderately the past month. Retail sales increased over the holidays, energy activity improved, and manufacturing activity remained fairly strong. The only sign of weakness was a slight slowdown in construction activity. In the farm economy, the winter wheat crop is in good shape and ranchers are expected to benefit from good quality pasture. Labor markets remain tight in much of the district, with more evidence of wage pressures than in the recent past. Prices edged up for some manufacturing materials and at the retail level.
All respondent banks left their prime lending rates unchanged last month and most expect to hold rates steady in the near term. Most banks did not change their consumer lending rates and anticipate no future changes. Lending standards were unchanged at most banks.
The financial condition of district farmers is extremely strong, perhaps the best in recent years. The majority of the farm loan portfolios in the district are doing well, with very few loans turned down due to financial weakness. Loan demand is expected to increase in grain-producing areas, while areas of the district that produce livestock are not anticipating an increase in demand. Due tohealthy profits for district farmers, farm equipment dealers are enjoying a substantial increase in sales, while auto and truck sales have risen more slowly.
