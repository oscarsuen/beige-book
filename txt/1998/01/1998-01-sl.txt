Despite reports of modest retail sales growth during the holiday season, the District economy started the new year showing signs of continued moderate growth. Manufacturers and other business contacts remain optimistic, with orders and inventories at desired levels. Residential construction slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter, while nonresidential construction remained strong in southern parts of the District. Loans outstanding at large District banks rose moderately in the final two months of 1997. District sales tax collections suggest that spending weakened somewhat in the fourth quarter. Contacts in the agricultural sector continue to anticipate a slowing in farm exports because of the crisis in Asia.
Automobile dealers report mixed sales growth for November and December over a year earlier. Those with sales increases cite lower interest rates, larger rebates and incentives, and stronger local economies as reasons. Those with sales declines blame rising consumer debt levels and tighter credit standards as reasons. More than half of the respondents have used rebates extensively to move stock. But, for the most part, current auto inventories are too high. Generally, though, dealers are optimistic about the first quarter of 1998.
Orders and inventories at most District manufacturers are at expected levels. A contact in the meat packing industry, for example, reports a "booming" market because of low pork prices and high demand for sausage products. Even though auto sales have been somewhat sluggish, some suppliers to the auto industry are expanding. For instance, a new stamping plant will open in southern Indiana. The District aerospace industry also got a boost from an expansion of a current Navy contract for jets. UPS reports that its Louisville hub is running even with or a bit ahead of both 1996 levels and 1997 projections. Sluggish sales of home appliances, however, led one company to let its seasonal workforce go early. Slowing apparel sales have led a St. Louis-based retailer to reduce employment by another 100 workers.
