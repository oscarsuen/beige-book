The Seventh District economy continued to expand at a modest pace in August and early September, but reports became more mixed than earlier this year.  Reports on consumer spending trends varied as the later Labor Day holiday may have delayed sales of some items.  Overall construction activity remained robust, with exceptional strength in housing and highway development leading the way.  Manufacturing activity became more mixed, partly as a result of softening markets abroad.  Lending activity remained brisk, although business demand may have softened somewhat.  The District's labor markets quickly shook off the ill effects of auto industry strikes and remained much tighter than the nation as a whole.  Crop conditions in the Seventh District were steady and generally favorable heading into September, but prices for most agricultural products continued to lag year-earlier levels.  Most contacts stated that it was too early to assess any impacts from the recent stock market volatility and economic turmoil in Russia.
However, crop conditions in Michigan lagged the other District states due to a lack of rainfall.  Corn and soybean prices continued to decline in August, with corn prices reaching their lowest level in ten years.  In addition, prices for hogs and beef cattle continued to run well below year-earlier levels.  In contrast, dairy farmers benefitted from lower feed costs and milk prices that were, on average, 20 percent higher than in August 1997.  Our survey of agricultural bankers indicated that overall farmland values were unchanged during the second quarter, and most bankers expected farmland values to remain stable in the third quarter.  The bankers also noted that the pace of loan repayments was slower than a year ago and anticipated a year-over-year decline in requests for loans to purchase farm machinery and equipment this fall.
