Eleventh District economic activity decelerated in August.  Manufacturing activity declined. Demand for business services continued to increase, although there were pockets of weakness. Construction activity remained at very high levels, but with signs of softening in some areas. Loan demand was still strong, but financing for large office projects had slowed.  Energy activity continued to decline.  Rain provided drought relief for farmers and ranchers but was little help for the serious financial stress confronting some producers.  Across a wide range of industries, business sentiment regarding the future weakened considerably in recent weeks.
Prices were mixed for service firms, mostly because rising wages were offsetting lower input costs for some companies.  Difficulty finding qualified workers led to increasing wages and fees for business service firms.  Transportation firms said declining fuel costs have offset wage pressures, resulting in unchanged fees and prices. Some retailers reported an increase in the volume of goods imported from Asia. Imports prices are lower than a year ago for some contacts, although one retailer does not expect to see price declines on Asian imports until goods are received next Spring.  Most retailers said they are passing lower input costs on to selling prices, while others are keeping selling prices stable because input price declines are offsetting higher wage costs.  On average, the price picture has turned deflationary, and while wage pressures remain prevalent, ability to shift these pressures forward to consumers is absent in most industries.
