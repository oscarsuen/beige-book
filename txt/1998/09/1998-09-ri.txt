Fifth District economic growth moderated in the weeks since our last report.  Weak auto sales and light customer traffic held back retail expansion, and service sector sales were off their earlier pace.  Manufacturing growth eased in recent weeks, slowed in part by increased competition from Asian producers.  Real estate and banking activity remained strong, but there were signs that growth may be leveling off.  Workers remained in short supply across the District.  Wage pressures picked up in the services sector but eased somewhat in retail and manufacturing.  Prices of goods and services advanced at modest rates.  In agriculture, Hurricane Bonnie brought much needed rainfall to farmland in some areas, but also caused widespread damage to crops in coastal areas of Virginia and the Carolinas.
Commercial real estate activity continued at a high level, although little growth was reported outside of West Virginia and South Carolina.  Despite the overall sluggishness in the sector, the construction and leasing of retail properties continued to be more active in most areas.  Several contacts, however, were cautious about future activity.  A South Carolina realtor noted that the pace of acquisitions had slowed in his area and that institutional buyers were "backing away" from deals as their sources of money dried up.  Similarly, a contact in the Washington, D.C., area said that some buyers were "folding their tents" and that some capital was "fleeing" the real estate market in recent weeks.
