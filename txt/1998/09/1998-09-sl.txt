District economic conditions remain quite healthy.  Although the pace of growth does not appear to have slowed much, particularly in view of recent financial market unrest, there is some expectation of moderating labor market demand over the last three months of the year.  Retailers report that summer sales either met or exceeded expectations and are upbeat about sales prospects for the rest of the year.  Auto sales have been up moderately at non-GM dealers.  Tight labor markets still reign in most of the District, and most contacts report continued strong demand for their products.  Sales of new and existing homes have held up well, and new construction remains strong overall.  Compared with the average of three months earlier, the most recent Manpower survey indicates some tempering of the demand for labor in the fourth quarter.  Loan demand at several large District banks appears to have slowed during the past two months.
Labor market conditions are expected to slacken only modestly in Louisville, with roughly no change expected in Little Rock. Compared with the same survey a year earlier, net business hiring on average is expected to be down even more, about 13 percentage points, with firms in all four cities indicating less willingness to add staff.  On a positive note, manufacturing firms seem increasingly willing to add employees, which is somewhat of a break from the recent developments.
