Overall business conditions in the Third District improved slightly in August, although there was evidence of slower activity in some sectors.  Manufacturers reported a better rate of shipments and orders compared to July.  Retailers saw a sales increase for back-to-school shopping, although the year-over-year increase was slight.  Auto sales were steady.  Bank loan volume has been declining.  Suburban commercial real estate markets remained fairly tight, although the vacancy rate has increased in central Philadelphia.  Home sales had been steady, but real estate agents noted a drop in inquiries and purchases in the last week in August.
Expectations for future conditions have become more modest and uncertain than they were earlier in the year.  Manufacturers expect growth in the next six months to be slower than it has been so far this year.  Retailers say the small boost from back-to-school sales may portend slower growth ahead.  Bankers expect some pickup in consumer lending but do not anticipate an increase in business lending.  Real estate agents believe some prospective home buyers may delay purchases until financial markets return to stability.
On net, industrial prices in the District continued to move down in August.  Nearly eight in ten firms surveyed reported steady prices; however, among those noting changes, more firms reported declines than increases in both input costs and the prices of their products.
Despite the improvement in August, manufacturers anticipate slightly slower growth in business during the next six months.  They expect only modest gains in orders, but they foresee some firming of prices.  On balance, they plan to continue adding to payrolls.
Commercial real estate markets remained strong in most parts of the District, according to recent surveys by brokers.  Office vacancy rates have fallen and rents have risen in most suburban markets, but vacancies have increased in Philadelphia's central business district.  The increase in rents is expected to slow during the rest of the year as speculative and build-to-suit construction catches up to the demand for more space.  The vacancy rate for industrial space has been falling in the suburbs but rising in Philadelphia.  Contacts in some parts of the District report that it is difficult to obtain local government approval for industrial construction, and this is limiting the supply of new space.
