The Twelfth District economy expanded at a moderate pace during the most recent survey period.  Sales of retail merchandise and services were brisk, although automobile sales were constrained by short inventories of new General Motors vehicles.  Manufacturing activity was flat overall, largely due to slowing among high-tech manufacturers.  Agricultural producers faced low prices and low yields for some crops.  Real estate and construction activity generally was vigorous, particularly in California, although a few real estate markets softened elsewhere.  Financial institutions faced strong loan demand and competitive supply conditions.  The prices of most commodities remained stable or fell, but prices for some services rose noticeably.
Due to sharp increases in the volume of East Asian imports, shipping prices for imports have risen substantially; inbound cargo charges are up 33 percent according to one garment industry respondent.  Despite the sharp rise in import volumes, respondents did not report any delivery bottlenecks for retail items.  Upward price pressure on retail merchandise has been curtailed by the availability of inexpensive imports and weak prices for commodities more generally.  In contrast, the prices of services such as airline travel, health care, and cable TV reportedly have started to rise significantly.
Among manufacturers and firms in other industries, investment spending on computer and information processing equipment reportedly has remained high due to Year 2000 conversion efforts.  However, growth has slowed compared to recent years, particularly in some areas and industries where conversion activity is winding down.  Respondents generally reported that investment in other plant and equipment was flat to down slightly on net.
