The district economy continued to grow moderately last month, fueled by further improvements in retail sales and construction and fairly strong activity in manufacturing.  Even the recently weak energy sector experienced marginal improvements last month.  In the farm economy, prospects for bumper corn and soybean crops have depressed crop prices, while pasture conditions have generally been good.  Labor markets in much of the district were still very tight last month, and evidence of wage pressures, although present, remained relatively stable.  Prices edged up at the retail level and for some construction materials.  In contrast, prices for most manufacturing materials continued to decline as a result of the Asian crisis.
All respondent banks left their prime lending rates unchanged last month.  Most banks  also held their consumer lending rates constant, although a few lowered rates.  Some banks expect to lower their prime rate and consumer lending rates in the near future, while others say they are unsure what will happen to these rates.  A few banks tightened lending standards last month, citing concerns over economic conditions.
In spite of low prices for most producers, district bankers are not overly concerned about the condition of their agricultural loan portfolios.  Most portfolios are only slightly weaker than a year ago.  In particular, most farmers and ranchers entered the current period of low prices with substantial equity to ride out the storm.
