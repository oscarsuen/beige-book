Ninth District economic growth continues at a moderate to strong pace in most sectors.  Ongoing robust construction helps pull the economy ahead and abundant consumer spending buoys retailing.  Manufacturing apparently is growing slightly.  Output is also steady to strong in energy, mining and agriculture, but low output prices in these sectors are squeezing producers financially and have retarded new capital investment.  Banks are doing well overall. Labor markets remain very tight, with unemployment rates at or near historic lows in most areas, and many firms still cannot find needed workers.
Business and consumer sentiment appears much more guarded than earlier in the summer for a variety of reasons. Air travel dependent business is disrupted by an ongoing pilots strike.  In some areas, the financial plight of farmers is casting a pall over the broader economy, while elsewhere recent international economic events and declines in capital markets are described as causes for concern.
Realtors continue to describe strong business in new and existing housing as strong incomes and low interest rates fuel demand.  One Minnesota-based agent says, "a lot of people are expressing some concern about the future of the economy, but they are still going ahead and making offers."
"Earnings to be 'mindblowing'," headlined an early September news story on second-quarter profits for a Minnesota-based national electronics retailer.  National and regional retail chains based in the district also report robust sales across many categories of consumer goods.  General consumer spending continues robust across many product lines.  Reports on vehicle sales are somewhat mixed.  They are generally strong in urban areas, and weaker in rural ones.  A Montana General Motors dealer describes significant sales declines as a result of the strike but notes generally good demand overall.  North and South Dakota dealers' representatives describe moderate to good sales in larger cities, but very sluggish ones in smaller towns that are dependent on agriculture.
Tourist businesses across the district generally had a good summer season.  Spokespersons describe cheap gasoline and favorable weather as beneficial factors.  National destinations such as Mount Rushmore and Yellowstone and Glacier parks had somewhat higher visitation than in 1997.  A source in South Dakota said that warm weather and crop conditions favor good fall hunting.
Some worker reductions are occurring.  A major manufacturing firm extended planned cuts from 4,000 to 4,500 persons as part of a restructuring hastened by overall decreased profits from Asian operations.  A check-printing firm also increased announced layoffs from 2,500 to 3,500, as part of internal restructuring rather than weak demand.
Strikes are a more prominent feature of district labor markets than in many years.  Telecommunications workers were off the job in August and a pilots strike continues to shut down a major airline.  Both disrupted other business activity, with the airline strike having wider effects.
Prices remain in check.  Motor fuels are at some of the lowest levels so far this decade.  Weak Asian currencies are helping to keep prices of imported goods such as clothing, toys and consumer electronics low.  Both manufacturers and retailers describe an intensely competitive business environment in which it is difficult to raise prices.
