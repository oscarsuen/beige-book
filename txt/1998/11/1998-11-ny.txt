Economic growth in the District has slowed further since the last report, with softening in a number of sectors.  Retail sales were generally below plan in September but on or close to plan in October, with discounters out-performing department store chains.  While housing markets remain firm in much of the District, pockets of weakness have emerged in and near New York City.  The office rental market remains tight; however, sales and prices of commercial properties have fallen in recent weeks, with one industry expert citing a "severe credit crunch" in commercial real estate.
While the region's labor market remains firm, prospects for job and income losses on Wall Street appear to have dampened consumer confidence.  Regional surveys of purchasing managers suggest continued weakness in manufacturing activity in September, but fairly sturdy growth in non-manufacturing sectors.  Finally, local banks report a pickup in loan demand?largely for home mortgages?and steady to declining delinquency rates.
Major retailers report they are unaffected by shipping bottlenecks.  Contacts say that inventories are generally "in good shape"; two major chains note some overhang in fall apparel but expect it to move as cold weather arrives.  Retail selling prices and merchandise costs were generally steady, and are expected to remain so through the upcoming holiday season.  However, price reductions are widely anticipated on Spring 1999 merchandise?mainly imported apparel and electronics.  Retailers report steady wage pressures, but express concern about adequate staffing for the upcoming holiday season.
The commercial real estate rental market remains exceptionally tight, though the sales market has cooled, largely due to financing problems.  One industry expert in northern New Jersey notes a "severe credit crunch" in commercial real estate, affecting the sales market for office, industrial and retail properties, and possibly hindering future construction activity.  In Manhattan, the sales market for office properties softened considerably in September; however, office rents continued to rise at a more than 25 percent annual rate and vacancy rates held fairly steady at low levels in August and September.  Office markets in NYC's suburbs were mixed; in Long Island and northern New Jersey, vacancy rates declined in the third quarter, while rents rose modestly.  In the northern suburbs (Westchester and Fairfield), vacancy rates edged up, while rents were little changed.
In western New York State, contacts report that commercial construction was quite strong in 1998, but some firms anticipate some weakening in 1999.  Still, one major supplier of construction equipment attributed its strong sales to the "highway bill" and expects business  to stay strong in 1999.
Local purchasing managers surveys suggest that manufacturing activity has softened relative to other sectors in September.  Buffalo manufacturers report some acceleration in production activity in September, but a downturn in both new orders and employment.  Rochester purchasers note continued weakness in the local manufacturing sector, but a pickup in activity in nonmanufacturing sectors.  New York purchasing managers report a modest pickup in manufacturing and continued sturdy growth in other sectors.  In general, prices paid for commodities continued to decline, while prices for contracted services continued to rise.
New York City's hotel occupancy rate, after seasonal adjustment, fell to a three-year low in the third quarter, though it is still at a high level.  There have been no reports of real disappointment about revenue lost as a result of the Yankees' sweep in the World Series.
Interest rates on all types of loans declined over the last two months.  Residential loan rates were lowered almost universally?by 93 percent of the banks surveyed.  Average deposit interest rates decreased over the past two months, with 71 percent of the bankers surveyed reporting lower rates. Delinquency rates on consumer loans and mortgages fell, suggesting continued improvement in the quality of credit; delinquency rates on commercial and industrial loans held steady.
