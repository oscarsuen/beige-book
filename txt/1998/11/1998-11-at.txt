The pace of current economic activity weakened slightly in the Sixth District since the last Beige Book, according to business contacts, but the outlook remained positive.  Merchants' sales were somewhat above those of a year ago, and expectations are positive for holiday sales.  Factory orders and production weakened recently, but more industry contacts expect recovery over the next few months than was the case in the last Beige Book.  The tourism and hospitality sector is mixed with good domestic business, but there is growing concern that weakness in overseas economies will continue to hold back foreign tourists.  Commercial construction remains strong; however, residential building and sales have moderated, and the outlook is for slower growth.  Tight labor markets continue to constrain District employers, but significant wage escalations remain limited to a few sectors.  Prices remain stable, with a few exceptions.
