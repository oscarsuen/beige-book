District reports suggested that the pace of economic expansion moderated in September and October amid signs of slowing in some sectors.  Retail sales were mostly at or below merchants' expectations, but there were only scattered reports of unanticipated inventory accumulation.  Real estate and construction activity remained generally robust, especially in residential markets, but most Districts reported that more stringent credit standards were a factor slowing commercial real estate activity.  Manufacturing activity continued at relatively high levels, but was the sector most often cited as showing signs of softening.  Lending activity varied by region, with demand remaining strong, although many lenders were reported to be tightening standards somewhat, mostly on business loans.  Labor markets remained very tight in most Districts, although demand for workers in manufacturing industries was softening in some areas.  Crop conditions varied across Districts as the fall harvest progressed.  Low commodity prices and adverse weather conditions in some areas were increasing concerns among farmers and agricultural banks.  Upward pressure on most wages remained subdued.  Prices at the retail level were little changed, while producers' prices for intermediate inputs were generally flat to down.
Virtually all Districts reported that businesses and consumers remained cautious about the economic outlook.  Boston and St. Louis noted increasing concern while Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Minneapolis reported a modestly improved outlook.
Nonresidential construction activity, both private and public, remained strong in most Districts, although there were signs of softening in commercial real estate markets.  St. Louis and Richmond reported noticeable decreases in speculative building.  A contact in the Richmond District attributed the weakness, in part, to the lack of credit, adding that "spec" development that wasn't already underway had come to a halt.  Minneapolis, on the other hand, was reporting the strongest office market in over a decade.
Consumer lending activity was reportedly strong in most Districts, especially in New York, Chicago, and Kansas City.  Cleveland noted a further softening of consumer lending conditions from their last report.  Mortgage originations and refinancing activity picked up as mortgage interest rates fell.  Asset quality on consumer loans was generally unchanged from the last Beige Book report, and only two Districts--New York and Kansas City--reported tightening standards, albeit modest.
Concerns at agricultural banks continued as low commodity prices persisted.  Chicago reported that after a few good years most farmers could withstand the low prices this year, but could falter if soft prices continued well into next year.  Banks in the Minneapolis District continued to be very concerned, as some banks sought to diversify by branching into urban markets.  Lenders in the Kansas City District noted a deterioration in their agricultural portfolios from last year.
Reflecting a general softening in the industrial sector, manufacturing employment reportedly declined in nearly half the Districts, while St. Louis and Kansas City indicated  increased hiring in some segments.  The Boston and New York Districts noted layoffs and bonus reductions in the financial services industry due to recent volatility in financial markets.  By contrast, the Chicago District noted little effect.
Upward pressure on wages and prices remained generally subdued, according to most District reports.  Cleveland, however, noted that temporary help agencies had increased wages in order to fill positions in the last three months.  Contacts in the Atlanta District suggested that, while wages continued to go up in parts of the region, employers were absorbing most of the added costs and not passing them along in the form of higher prices.  Most producers' input prices declined while output prices generally remained flat.  The general tone of District reports suggests little, if any, change in retail price pressures.
With the exception of dairy producers, who were benefitting from low feed costs and near record product prices, the industry was facing low prices that resulted from the squeeze generated by a substantial carryover, large new crop production, and a marked cutback in demand from foreign markets, Asia in particular.  Contacts in the Dallas District noted that as many as 25 percent of the region's producers would discontinue production over the next year.  Kansas City observed that the downturn in the farm economy was also being felt by rural "Main Street" businesses, and farm equipment dealers and manufacturers.
