Despite uncertainty and increasing caution, the level of output in the Ninth District economy continues strong. Construction seems indefatigable and is a source of strength for the broader economy.  Consumers continue to buy freely and tourist revenues are the strongest in some time.  Manufacturing, which is generally strong, shows increasing variation among firms and some signs of slowing growth.  Natural resource sector production continues largely unchanged except for iron mining, which faces cuts due to increased steel imports.  Banking remains profitable overall.  Labor markets remain tight in most areas.  Agriculture, pressed by low prices for crops and livestock, remains the most financially strained sector.
"Sales have generally been pretty good," says an eastern Montana auto dealer.  "Sales are OK in the bigger towns," reports a South Dakota dealers' association representative noting the negative effects of low farm prices on sales in rural areas.  Overall, district auto sales appear unchanged, good but not growing appreciably.
"Tourist season a huge success," headlined a Michigan newspaper's description of activity in the Upper Peninsula.  Montana officials described that state's season as one of the three best ever.  For the first time in four years, tourism and recreation businesses across the whole district had a very strong year.  Expectations for fall hunting business in South Dakota and Montana are also strong.
But some signs of slowing are evident.  A Minnesota iron-mining firm reduced overtime hours as it cut production.  And in western Wisconsin, unemployment rates edged up over the summer, though they remain below national levels and those experienced a year ago in the area.  As in the past several quarters, there are anecdotal reports of substantial salary increases for certain occupations, but firmwide payincreases continue in the 2 percent to 4 percent range.
Price increases are virtually nonexistent at the producer level and small for consumers.  One manufacturer said that cheaper steel is helping to offset somewhat higher wages.  Motor fuels continue to trend slightly downward.
