The district economy continued to grow moderately last month, but signs of easing appear to be mounting.  Retail sales and construction activity remained solid, growing at a slower pace than in the recent past.  Manufacturing activity slowed slightly last month with fewer plants operating at high levels of capacity.  The energy sector improved marginally for the second straight month, although gains are expected to be short-lived.  In the farm economy, corn and soybean yields have been coming in below expectations, but record plantings should still lead to a large harvest.  Labor markets remained very tight in most of the district, with continued evidence of moderate wage pressures.  Prices edged up at the retail level and for some construction materials, while prices for most manufacturing materials continued to decline.
All respondent banks but one decreased their prime lending rate, and all respondents planned to reduce their prime lending rate in the near term.  Most banks held their consumer lending rates constant; however, most also expected to reduce consumer lending rates in the near term.  A majority of banks left lending standards unchanged.  A few banks reported a tightening of lending standards for all loan categories.  Among those banks that tightened lending standards, the primary reason cited was a less favorable economic outlook. Respondent banks indicated their willingness to make loans was unchanged for all loan categories.
District bankers reported that their overall farm portfolios have deteriorated from a year ago, and concern is rising.  However, most bankers do not expect significant repayment problems or foreclosures this fall, as many producers are expected to carry over operating debt into next year.  Farmland values and cash rents in the district are weakening due to the low commodity prices.  Rural mainstreet businesses in most areas of the district are feeling the effects of the downturn in the general farm economy; farm equipment sales in the district are very slow.
