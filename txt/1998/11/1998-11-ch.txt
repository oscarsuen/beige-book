The Seventh District economy continued to expand, although some key industry segments softened somewhat.  Consumer spending became more mixed than in our previous report and merchants were more cautious about the upcoming holiday season.  Housing activity remained exceptionally robust in the region while business construction appeared to slow moderately.  Manufacturing activity continued at high levels, but some key industry segments--notably steel and agricultural equipment--were clearly adversely affected by events abroad.  Lenders reportedly tightened standards on select loans, commercial real estate particularly, but credit availability was a non-issue for most contacts.  Labor markets remained very tight in virtually all locales, despite a decrease in manufacturing employment.  District farmers continued to be affected by low grain and hog prices.
