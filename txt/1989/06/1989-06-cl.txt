A common thread in most of the forecasts is the persistence of inflation at about an annual average rate of 4.5 percent through the end of 1990. A concern expressed by some of the group is that the rate of inflation will not slow once it builds, and that it will not easily slow unless there is some slack in the economy. Therefore, an issue raised by discussants is whether there is greater cost if the inflation rate climbs to 6% or if the unemployment rate climbs to 6%. Some felt that policy risks must be taken now to lower the inflation rate; otherwise, inflation will build in the absence of slack. A few also cautioned that an easier monetary policy would risk accelerating inflation in a full employment economy.
Auto retailers describe consumer responses to the latest round of incentives as lackluster and worse than expected. Incentives initially boosted new car sales but consumer interest since then has waned. Dealers generally complain of squeezed profit margins partly because of interest costs on unsold inventories, which have also resulted in some dealers offering cars at about cost. Dealers contacted expect that their orders for 1990 models will be conservative because of a likelihood of high inventories of 1989 models going into the new model year.
Capital goods respondents report that business remains strong and has been unaffected by interest rates. One producer expects business spending for durable equipment to be only slightly less this year than last. He expects that capital stock will increase faster than industrial output this year, thereby easing pressure on operating rates and on producer prices. Another producer reports no let up in orders for electrical equipment. Prices might increase a little more this year despite ample capacity as producers attempt to recover some of the higher costs of copper and aluminum. A machinery producer reports production schedules for domestic purchasers are leveling out, availability of materials is improving, and price pressures are showing some signs of easing.
Steel producers also note some let up in activity from consumer durable and capital goods producers. Summer vacations, auto changeovers, and some softening in demand for steel are expected to reduce steel shipments next quarter from this.
Some banks report that loan demand surged in May, despite higher interest rates, and speculated that business loans were being used to finance inventories. The latest decline in the prime rate is not expected to change loan activity much, even though loans tied to the prime rate will also be adjusted slightly downward. Some mortgage lenders and a producer of household appliances expect that recent declines in mortgage rates, which may result in a better-than-previously-expected level of housing sales and starts.
