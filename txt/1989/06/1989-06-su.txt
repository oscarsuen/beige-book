Economic activity for most of the nation continues to advance, but a number of Federal Reserve districts note ebbing rates of expansion. Although auto sales have dipped, reports of retail sales are generally positive. Manufacturing growth is leveling off. Real estate markets are sluggish. In the resources sector, firming oil prices have helped the energy-producing districts, while environmentally-related legal issues are said to have restricted lumber supplies. Recent rains have alleviated drought problems in several districts. Loan growth varies considerably across regions. A number of districts mention undesirably high inventories,particularly in autos. With some exceptions, wage and price pressures are not accelerating. Some districts said their respondents had not been able to pass their input cost increases through to their customers.
Auto sales have weakened. Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco all note softening demand, while Atlanta mentions undesirably high inventories among dealers. Dallas cites moderate sales growth and Minneapolis also refers to recent expansion. San Francisco reports that demand is strong in some parts of its district, although not in most of them.
