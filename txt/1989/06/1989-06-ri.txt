Manufacturers and retailers expect a deterioration in the trade balance and little change in the rate of increase in prices and wages in the next few months. Bankers expect inflation to remain in check.
Retail activity differed by type of store. Most car dealers indicated declines in sales. Sales at department stores apparently improved in May, however, as almost half of the respondents reported increases. Big ticket items did not sell well at department stores in May but are expected to do better in the next six months. None of the department store respondents expected sales to decline in the next six months.
District manufacturers are guardedly optimistic about prospects for growth in their businesses in the next six months. Respondents who expect increases in sales outnumbered those who expect declines, but more expect decreases than increases in employment, unfilled orders, and the length of the workweek. With regard to general business activity in the nation, more respondents expect decreases than increases in the next six months.
