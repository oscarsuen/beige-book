Many respondents report weak car sales, although sales in some parts of the District are strong. No upward price pressure is evident, as incentives are required to keep sales volumes up.
Heavy machinery is selling well, with reports of increases in sales volumes of 10 to 15 percent above last year's levels. Some manufacturers report that material costs have risen 5 to 12 percent, due primarily to higher costs for aluminum, stainless steel and brass. One respondent notes persistent shortages of titanium dioxide and ethylene glycol, important raw materials for paints and coatings. List prices for paints and coatings have increased about 5 percent, but price increases negotiated for large projects are closer to 1 or 2 percent.
A California banker reports that some customers in Japan are starting to cancel orders for U.S.-made manufactured goods. Some of these customers have been faced with price increases of about 21 percent (5 percent reflecting US inflation and 16 percent due to currency changes). Other Japanese customers are asking for price reductions, but because most American companies' profit margins are too small to make sizable price concessions, they are opting to forgo some export business.
Environmental and legal issues are combining with strong log exports to restrict log supplies and reduce lumber production. Capacity continues tight at most paper mills. However, new newsprint production capacity and soft newsprint demand have forced producers to back down from planned price increases this year, and one negotiated discount reduced the effective price by 3.5 percent.
Only a few respondents report that high interest rates have limited borrowing activity. In Oregon, for example, small businesses reportedly are borrowing less or not at all, choosing to postpone capital equipment purchases or expensive acquisitions rather than pay the high rates.
