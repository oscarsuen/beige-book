Manufacturing employment growth has slowed throughout the District. In Missouri, manufacturing employment in the February-April period declined slightly from the previous period largely due to job declines in food processing and a layoff in an auto assembly plant to reduce inventories. Automobile employment will decline this summer as two St. Louis auto assembly plants close for one month. Although auto assembly plants typically close for one or two weeks each summer to retool assembly lines for the next model year, analysts suggest the longer shutdowns this year are to reduce inventories.
In St. Louis, labor strikes shut down most commercial and residential construction projects for two weeks. St. Louis metropolitan area office vacancy rates, currently below the 1988 national average, are expected to rise sharply in 1989. The quantity of new space demanded in 1989 is expected to decline from 1988 levels while the volume of new space will almost triple.
