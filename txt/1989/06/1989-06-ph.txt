Indications from nearly all sectors of the Third District economy surveyed in June reveal little, if any, growth in recent weeks. Manufacturers report that both new orders and production activity have been virtually steady since April. Retailers say current dollar sales are generally running just even with the pace of last spring. Bankers indicate that growth in loans and deposits continues, but at a slower rate since May than in the first four months of the year. Realtors say that home sales in April and May were very sluggish but appear to be picking up with the recent drop in mortgage rates; however, commercial real estate markets are beginning to show signs of weakening.
The consensus outlook for the region's economy is for stable conditions, at best, through the summer. Manufacturers forecast steady to slightly slower activity for the second half of the year, and they are planning cuts in employment and smaller increases in capital spending. Retailers expect sales in the second half to run even with or fall below the current pace, in real terms. Bankers expect slower growth in loan demand from both businesses and consumers and they plan to reduce commercial real estate lending as well.
Firms in the region have seen a leveling off in the rate of new orders in the past few weeks, in contrast to the steady growth they had been experiencing, and order backlogs are falling as shipments continue on an upward trend. Nevertheless, inventory reduction, which had been reported for several months, appears to have stalled in June. Despite these indications of slackening demand for manufactured goods, industrial firms in the region are maintaining employment levels, although working hours are being trimmed at some plants. On the price front, increases in input costs are noted by nearly half of the companies contacted for this report and about one-quarter are raising the prices of their own products. These indications of price increases are not quite as widespread as they had been earlier this year.
Looking ahead, sentiment among Third District manufacturers is widely divided but, overall, slightly negative. On balance, managers at area plants forecast slower business during the second half of the year, with new orders running just steady and shipments declining as order backlogs are worked down. In line with their forecasts of reduced output, local firms plan to trim payrolls and working hours somewhat by year-end, and they intend to reduce inventories as well. Capital spending plans still call for increased outlays over the next six months, on balance, but compared to reports over the last twelve months, fewer firms are boosting spending and more are cutting back on plans.
Retailers expect a soft unmet, and some predict that the year-over-year gain in unit sales for the second half will drop below the increase posted in the first half. For 1989 as a whole, area merchants are in agreement that sales will increase by only a few percent above 1988, in dollar terms. With expectations receding, retailers are trimming inventories, cutting orders, and holding the line on hiring.
Deposit growth at major Third District banks has slipped in the past month, according to bankers, but not by as much as asset growth has, so bankers generally do not express concern about gathering funds. Demand deposits declined for most banks in May, and bankers attribute this to consumers shifting to interest-bearing accounts in response to the first quarter increase in interest rates and to increased use of cash management services by corporate customers. Time deposit growth is described as healthy. Several banks are promoting certificates of deposit, especially in 9-month to 2-year maturities, and they are gaining significant deposits with rates of up to 10 percent for the 2-year term.
Commercial real estate in the Third District is also showing some signs of softness. Office occupancy rates remain fairly healthy in the Philadelphia central business district, according to realtors, but plans for several major new buildings have been postponed. In the suburbs, vacancy rates are rising for both office and retail space, but construction has not slowed significantly. Industrial construction contracts awarded since April have fallen below the first quarter rate, according to builders, but remain above the value of contracts let during the spring of last year.
