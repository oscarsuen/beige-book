To balance the inventory picture somewhat, reports of desired accumulation and tightness were also received. A paper manufacturer reports a buildup of box inventories, but this was intentional in anticipation of increased demand later in the year. Several large retailers indicated that inventories are at desirable levels. A producer of telecommunication equipment reported less than desirable stocks in part because of increased export demand. Because of higher demand for electricity and strong export demand, coal stocks are below the level desired by producers.
Paper prices have recently backed off from the increased levels established early in 1989, and one producer anticipates further cuts. Weakness in the price of linerboard was also reported, and one paper manufacturer reports that while demand is strong, it is weaker than expected earlier this year. And a producer of wood pulp noted that his firm's price is currently 10 percent higher than that of some European producers.
Those surveyed report scattered labor market shortages but do not regard generalized wage pressures as substantial. Wage increases are generally reported below 5 percent. The cost of employee benefits, however, has been rising more rapidly and many contacts report they have been trying to reduce nonwage compensation to control costs, in particular, medical coverages for employee dependents is being restricted.
One respondent indicated that wages for unskilled, outdoor labor in Nashville are often well above minimum wage levels. Entry level workers for hotels and restaurants are in short supply, and a large Atlanta retailer reports that entry level wages have been under constant pressure, although productivity increases have so far offset wage gains. The shortage of registered nurses continues, with wages rising faster than inflation. One banker in Atlanta has found it difficult to locate experienced managers and skilled clerical help. A producer of lumber and paper indicated that mandatory Sunday overtime is being eliminated and that the firm has seen no unusual pressure on wages.
