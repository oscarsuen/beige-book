The Third District economy continues to expand as 1989 begins but there are indications that the pace of the advance may be slackening. Manufacturers polled for the January Business Outlook Survey report moderate improvement again this month, marking a full year of expansion according to the survey. Most retailers report meeting their Christmas sales goals of modest real growth from the previous year. Bankers indicate that loan growth was good as 1988 closed, with business, personal, and real estate lending all on the rise. Realtors describe the commercial real estate market as healthy but note a decline in residential sales since the summer.
While current conditions indicate continuing growth in most sectors of the Third District economy, slower progress may be ahead. Manufacturers expect activity to ease from its current pace during the first half of the year. Retailers are generally cautious in their sales planning for the new year and most are keeping inventories under tight control. Bankers note a falloff in business loan and mortgage applications in recent weeks, and they expect slower growth in all types of lending this year compared to last. Realtors expect commercial leasing activity in 1989 to run at around the same rate as in 1988. Although they are looking for a pickup in residential sales by spring, they say the prospect is uncertain.
Industrial prices in the region remain on an upward trend. Sixty-one percent of the January survey participants said they were paying more for inputs compared to December and 38 percent were raising the prices of their own products.
In contrast to current reports of generally healthy business conditions, local manufacturers predict some decline in activity by midyear. Looking out six months, 27 percent of the January survey participants expect the pace of business to slow while only 18 percent expect further improvement. On balance, survey respondents foresee the rate of orders holding steady during the first half of the year while shipments rise slightly, leading to a decline in order backlogs as manufacturing activity slows. Despite this forecast, survey respondents are planning to add workers and boost capital spending between now and summer.
Most merchants contacted in early January described their sales plans for 1989 as very cautious. Their impression of consumer confidence is that it is high but fragile; and many retailers believe that sales could drop off sharply in the wake of any negative economic news.
Third District auto sales in early January were up from the same period last year for domestic makes, but off for imports. Dealers say demand for most U.S. models is running above expectations although a few are not proving popular and incentives are being offered to reduce inventories of these cars. Area dealers say total unit sales in 1988 were around 3 percent higher than in 1987, in contrast with forecasts of a slow year. Few dealers expect growth to continue in 1989, but most think sales will not fall substantially below the 1988 level.
Most area bankers expect that the pace of growth for all types of lending will ease as the year progresses. They base this forecast on estimates of slower economic growth nationwide.
Demand for industrial buildings has been strong, coming mainly from area manufacturers who are expanding. Realtors say the supply of new space is tight; and they believe construction of new industrial buildings may decline this year due to a pullback in lending to builders by financial institutions.
Residential realtors say sales of existing homes have declined in many parts of the Third District since the summer, and price appreciation has slowed, as potential buyers are increasingly reluctant to pay current asking prices. Realtors expect sales activity to pick up gradually this spring as sellers begin to accept lesser gains than they had been anticipating on sales of their homes. Realtors do not view current mortgage rates as a deterrent to sales.
