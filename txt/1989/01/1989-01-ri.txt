Christmas sales were reported to be somewhat stronger than last year by department stores in the District. Over half of the respondents said their sales were higher than a year ago, while 15 percent said their sales were lower. Most respondents said merchandise markdowns during the Christmas season were about the same as usual.
Among manufacturers who export, about half said their export volume was flat in 1988, while about 45 percent reported increases. Only two respondents, both textile producers, indicated declines in their exports. Looking ahead, about three out of every five respondents expect increases in their exports in 1989 over 1988. Only one respondent expects his firm's exports to decline.
In this latest survey, more District manufacturers were optimistic than in our previous survey. Forty-nine percent of the January survey respondents expect their shipments to rise in the next six months and 15 percent expect declines, compared to 34 and 26 percent, respectively, in November. In the January survey, respondents expecting increases in each category of manufacturing activity—new orders, shipments, backlogs of orders, employment, and the workweek—outnumbered those expecting declines.
