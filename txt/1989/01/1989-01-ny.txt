Developments in the Second District economy in recent weeks have varied among sectors, in part reflecting seasonal influences. Most retailers described Christmas holiday sales as on or above plan and a pickup in office leasing has occurred. Homebuilding is seasonally slow and in some overbuilt areas, developers are offering concessions. While the percentage of purchasing managers reporting improved business conditions showed about a normal seasonal decline, the proportion indicating worsening conditions was somewhat higher than usual. Small- and medium-sized banks have recently increased interest rates charged on their loans.
Items in strong demand among holiday shoppers were electronic games, video cameras and recorders, appliances and men's clothing. Interest in women s apparel also improved, though the extent of the improvement varied. Inventory levels at the end of December also were mixed. One chain with lower than targeted inventories reported lost sales because of its having understocked several popular items. At the other extreme were two retailers with inventories well above plan, who expect to discount heavily throughout January in order to clear the remaining seasonal goods from their shelves.
With regard to the impact on the District of certain national developments, the newly proposed changes and closings at U. S. military bases are not expected to have an adverse effect on the District. Personnel from the Brooklyn Naval Station, which is slated for closing, will be moved to a new Staten Island facility. In addition, a New York State official recently stated that the newly signed U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement should be of benefit to much of western and northern New York. Finally, governors in each of the three District states reported substantial shortfalls in revenues and New York and New Jersey have imposed hiring freezes.
A pickup in office leasing has occurred in recent weeks. In downtown Manhattan a major brokerage firm leased 1.1 million square feet of space in a building at the World Trade Center which had been mostly vacant for a long time. Buildings going up on the west side of midtown Manhattan continue eliciting interest with the result that leasing there in 1988 was second only to 1987's record amount. Marine Midland Bank unveiled plans for a new office building in downtown Buffalo to house its backoffice operations, and work is also to begin soon on the second phase of New York City's conversion of the Brooklyn Army Terminal into industrial space for small manufacturers. The first phase, opened in late 1987, is 80 percent leased and negotiations for the remainder are underway.
