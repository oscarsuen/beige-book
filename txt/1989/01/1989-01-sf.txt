These sentiments about national trends contrast sharply with the respondents' own industry and area outlooks. Despite the negative outlook for the national economy, respondents generally report very strong conditions in their regions.
Agricultural exports from the District are expected to climb this year. One respondent in the Northwest reports very strong export activity for processed food to the Pacific Rim countries. Foreign demand is growing for agricultural products as tariff barriers are reduced. Some concern is registered in California, where a threatened tariff war with the European Community could reduce California's exports of walnuts and dried fruits.
Mining is very strong in the District. Respondents report substantial new investment to open new gold, silver, copper, and phosphate mines and to refurbish existing mines. Exports of copper are being eliminated by rising domestic consumption. Energy industries are being buoyed by rising oil prices, although most new expenditures on plant and equipment are designed to refurbish existing fields, rather than to discover new reserves.
Respondents in forest products industries report some easing of capacity constraints as demand growth slows and new capacity comes on stream. Production of plywood and lumber has fallen by 3 percent, but pulp and paper production remains near capacity. One respondent reports that log inventories have been rebuilt, but another respondent reports that small mills are unable to compete with Asian customers for logs and may be forced to close.
Electronics firms also are expanding. Several major electronics firms are building new plants in Idaho and other parts of the West. In California, however, sluggish sales of some electronic components have caused scattered layoffs.
