November employment in the St. Louis area was 1.3 percent higher than a year earlier. Manufacturing jobs constituted almost half of the additional jobs. An auto assembly plant and a military aircraft producer each added approximately 2,000 workers over the year. Most new nonmanufacturing jobs were in services, wholesale and retail trade and transportation. The number of construction jobs fell substantially.
Almost all respondents were satisfied with their inventory levels, which were generally leaner than those of a year ago. Consequently, they engaged in less than planned price-cutting and anticipate higher profits than last year. Women's apparel and consumer electronics were among the strongest selling products.
Most St. Louis respondents expressed more difficulty finding temporary Christmas help than in past years, but few raised wages. The availability of temporary help was also a problem facing some respondents in Memphis and Louisville but not those in Little Rock.
