Demand for capital goods is still increasing, on balance, among Tenth District manufacturers, although a sizable minority of respondents report some slowing. Nearly all respondents directed their 1988 capital spending toward equipment purchases rather than new plant construction, a mix that is expected to continue in 1989. Capital spending in 1988 did increase capacity slightly, however, through replacing obsolete equipment with more progressive equipment, acquiring additional equipment, and adding shifts.
The majority of respondents export some of their output, and they report stable to increasing exports, which are unhampered by capacity constraints. Firms generally believe they can easily switch from producing for domestic customers to producing for foreign customers. Most respondents import some of their capital goods, but few have been increasing those imports. Uncertainty about changes in the value of the dollar is not an important consideration in capital spending decisions.
Respondents from district savings and loan institutions report mixed savings inflow performance relative both to a year ago and to a month ago. Expectations of future savings inflows are also mixed. Promotional activity and a "flight to quality" from troubled institutions are largely credited for improvements in savings inflows at some institutions. Mortgage demand has been constant or down slightly in recent months. Mortgage interest rates have generally increased and are expected to increase further in the coming months.
Strong crop and livestock prices produced relatively high farm income in the Tenth District in 1988. As a result, year-end loan repayment rates were generally high, continuing the financial recovery begun in 1987. Most bankers in the region expect fewer credit renewals in the coming spring credit season as some farmers pay off operating loans and reduce carryover debt.
Changes in federal farm programs may have only a small effect on the financial situation of district farmers. Reduced acreage idling requirements may boost loan demand as farmers put land back into crop production. Fewer acres may be farmed in some areas of the district, however, as more acres are placed in the Conservation Reserve Program, trimming operating credit needs.
While strong livestock prices have contributed significantly to high farm income, little expansion has taken place in district livestock operations. Cow/calf operators appear to be just maintaining herds, holding back replacement heifers while selling cows. Inadequate wheat pastures have forced some stocker operations to reduce herds or purchase additional feed.
