Local auto dealers reported that December sales were very good, particularly for light trucks and minivans. Sales were slow during the first week of January, after which they rose moderately. Inventories are considered to be sufficient, but there are shortages of the most popular models. Although manufacturers' buyer incentive plans are widely available, dealers say they are not an important contributor to sales. Financing is readily available, and rising interest rates have not yet increased monthly payments enough to deter buyers.
Since last year at this time, Ohio added 90,000 jobs, raising employment by about 2 percent while the number of workers unemployed fell by 12 percent. The picture is similar in Pennsylvania, where jobs rose by 60,000, increasing employment by 1 percent while decreasing unemployed workers by 17 percent. Although the labor market in these areas is generally strong, employers reported ample supplies of qualified workers.
Eastern Kentucky, on the other hand, continues to experience a weak labor market. For example, a recent automobile plant opening there drew fifteen times as many applicants as there were job slots.
Most of the new jobs in the District have come from the service sector, with business services continuing to show the largest increases. Manufacturing employment has been flat throughout most of Ohio, while Pittsburgh experienced its first annual increase in manufacturing employment in almost a decade.
Price increases continue to be moderate. Only 41 percent of the respondents to the purchasing managers survey reported higher prices, which is the lowest percentage in over a year.
