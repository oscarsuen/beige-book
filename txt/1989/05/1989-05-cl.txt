The economy shows some mixed signs of slowing, led by consumer spending and residential construction. The worst of the surge in food and energy prices is probably over, assuming improved supplies. Higher interest rates are generally not considered to have had much effect on housing and other construction, or on capital goods industries. Thrifts continue to experience deposit outflows, although the April outflow apparently was not as severe as in previous months this year.
The automotive industry apparently is successfully offsetting higher interest rates by offering special financing rates and cash rebates that are the broadest and, in some cases, the most generous yet offered. Incentives are not as broad for foreign cars. Auto dealers report strengthening sales in early April. They generally are guardedly optimistic over spring and summer sales but are more cautious than dealers surveyed in early March. Dealers and consumers appear concerned over the course of the economy and interest rates, and dealers are cautious in placing orders that may add to their inventory. Moreover, liberalized lending terms have been attracting higher credit-risk buyers.
Steel operations are still at full capacity for cold-rolled and galvanized sheets, but producers report capacity is available for some other types of steel products. Some producers also note recent softening for bar products (for machinery and automotive industries) and structural steels (for buildings).
Gasoline prices are probably close to a peak, barring additional supply constraints, and crude oil prices will probably be under downward pressure over the next few months as difficult additional supplies become available. The Alaska pipeline is already back to capacity, although deliveries are still limited.
Banks report a softening in consumer installment and mortgage loans in recent weeks, and a reduced volume of commercial and industrial loans.
