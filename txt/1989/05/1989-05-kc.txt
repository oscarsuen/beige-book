Most respondents from district savings and loan institutions report a net outflow of deposits over the last month. In most cases, net flows of deposits are comparable to a year ago. Respondents' expectations for deposit flows in the near future are mixed, but several expect further outflows if interest rates keep increasing. Respondents report mixed demand for mortgages, with a pickup expected during the summer. Many respondents expect mortgage rates to peak within the next three months and then to decline for the rest of the year.
Only a few banks expect further increases in lending rates in the near future; the remaining banks anticipate no change. Deposit behavior varied both across the district and across types of deposits. Approximately equal numbers of respondents reported increases and decreases in deposits. Decreases were mostly in demand deposits, NOW accounts, and money market deposit accounts. Increases were generally in IRA and Keogh accounts and in small time and savings deposits.
Results of spring credit reviews by district bankers generally reflect strong financial conditions among farmers and ranchers. Most operators had good financial performances both last year and the year before. Given the relatively strong financial conditions of borrowers, most bankers do not feel that their agricultural loan portfolios are at risk, especially if dry conditions affect only the wheat crop and normal weather returns to the rest of the district.
