Manufacturers reported that the prices of both finished products and raw materials continued to rise in recent weeks at about the same rate as in February. A number of respondents indicated their profits would suffer because they were afraid to pass along the increases in raw materials prices.
District manufacturers remain optimistic about prospects for continued economic growth in the nation and for their businesses in the next six months, although their optimism has diminished somewhat from our February survey. In the current month's survey, as in the previous one, the number of respondents expecting increases in shipments and new orders exceeded the number expecting declines. In a reversal of the results of our February survey, however, the majority of respondents to our current survey now expect backlogs of orders, employment, and the length of the workweek to decline in the next six months.
