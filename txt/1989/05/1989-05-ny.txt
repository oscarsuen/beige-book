The pattern of developments in the Second District economy was mixed since the last report. Unemployment rates fell sharply in New Jersey and New York during March, though primarily as a result of fewer job seekers, and office leasing activity continued at a moderately rapid pace. In contrast, however, demand for new housing varied considerably over the District and consumer spending was generally slow in March. Most small and mid-sized banks reported that demand for home mortgages is approximately unchanged from what it was last spring.
In spite of the lackluster sales results, most respondents reported that inventories were at satisfactory levels, due in part to large markdowns on some items. Based on one weeks results, April is showing a better tone than March and respondents were hopeful that this would continue.
Eighty-four percent of purchasing managers in Rochester and 75 percent in Buffalo reported stable to improved general business conditions in March, virtually unchanged from the February numbers. In both cities more than half the surveyed firms reported higher prices on the commodities they purchased.
Few new investment projects were announced in recent weeks. Among the largest of these was a $70 million business park in the Rochester area which Eastman Kodak and Pioneer Development Corporation hope to begin constructing this year. The park would include office buildings, shops, restaurants and hotels to be built on vacant land owned by Kodak.
Office leasing activity has been at a moderately strong pace since the last report, with vacancy rates showing little or no change. Upward pressure on vacancy rates in Manhattan is expected to build, however, with the completion of many new commercial buildings now under construction and an increased supply of existing office space as these new buildings become occupied. Elsewhere in the District, the volume of new construction in northern New Jersey and Fairfield County has slowed somewhat and some observers believe this represents a turning point in the prolonged and rapid expansion of those suburban areas.
