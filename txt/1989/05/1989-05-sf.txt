Auto sales are reported to be slow throughout the District, a condition many attribute to higher interest rates. One auto dealer reports that, although sales were up sharply in early April, the increase was no more than seasonally expected, despite sales incentives. Moreover, he notes that the recent jump was not enough to take the pressure off dealers. Prices are still soft, and dealers are ordering very cautiously to avoid excessive inventory buildup.
Most other manufacturing sectors report more moderate growth, although activity appears to be weakening in product lines tied to construction activity. For example, demand for paints and coatings is flat compared with a year ago, and a large floor covering distributor reports a 12 percent decline in carpeting sales from last year's level.
Conditions in the forest products industries are mixed. Consumption of linerboard and boxes is rising at a 2 percent rate, while newsprint consumption has fallen with a decline in classified advertising. Shortages of logs have boosted prices despite slowing consumption by the construction industry. Lack of available logs has caused some lumber mills to reduce capital expenditure plans, and one lumber industry contact reports reducing his firm's capital expenditure budget to a third of its originally planned level. Further expansion is anticipated at paper mills.
Oil prices have risen sharply on the West Coast in the aftermath of the Alaska oil spill. Sources in Alaska report that the spill is helping the Alaskan economy at the moment, with fishermen being paid $2,500 per day for use of their boats in the clean-up operation. Exxon has told area residents that the company will compensate them for all reasonable claims of lost income resulting from the spill.
