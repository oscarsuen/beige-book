At the other extreme, prices of construction materials and products associated with the slowing building industry are generally feeling little or no upward pressure. The major exception is the price of cement which has increased 10 to 12 percent so far this year. Imported cement is primarily responsible for the upward price pressure. On the other hand, demand is slowing for lumber and additional softness is anticipated because of the slowdown in residential housing.
In agriculture, prices of vegetables have moderated with the regrowth of fresh vegetable crops since the February freeze. However, prices of broilers and eggs are holding at relatively high levels. The broiler industry is benefiting from rapid demand growth in the fast food industry, which is supporting prices at a highly profitable level for all chicken producers. Feed costs, though higher than a year ago, have not risen recently and there is hope that prospects for larger grain crops in 1989 may soon cause feed prices to decline. Last year's heavy losses drove egg producers out of the business reducing supplies and contributing to current high egg prices.
Most new capital investments are expenditures to upgrade machinery and production techniques which will enhance the output from the currently employed work force. In agriculture, crop farmers are sharply expanding purchases of machinery and equipment mostly to replace worn items that were held in service during the low-income period over the past several years. The broiler producing and processing industry is the major exception to the general trend. New processing plants are being built to respond to the brisk growth in the nationwide demand for chicken products. A significant investment to expand grower facilities is also required to supply the new processing capacity.
