Ninth District economic conditions have continued to be fairly good. Unemployment rates have risen modestly, mostly due to seasonal changes. Consumer spending has been good. Prices have increased moderately and conditions in resource-related industries have been excellent.
Motor vehicles have been selling well. Dealers for one domestic manufacturer report that sales in the first twenty days of February were down 6 percent from the comparable period in January, but were up 10 percent over the same period in February 1988. Sales were good in January for this manufacturer with car sales up 14 percent and truck sales up 15 percent from January 1988. March Is normally the biggest selling month for motor vehicles, so the next thirty days should set the tone for the next year. There is some uncertainty about the effect of recent interest rate increases on motor vehicle sales.
Housing activity has been fairly stable. The number of new housing permits issued in Minnesota increased by 4.4 percent from December 1987 to December 1988. Home sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area were up 6.24 percent in January 1989 from January 1988.
Tourist spending has been good throughout the district. Heavy snowfall in the resort areas attracted a large number of skiers.
