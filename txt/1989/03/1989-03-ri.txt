Prices at both the producer and retail levels continued to rise at about the same pace as was reported in January. Many manufacturers and retailers indicated that they had increased wages in the last two months. An increased number of manufacturers expressed concern about labor shortages.
A telephone survey of large hotels and resorts in the District indicated that tourist activity this winter was stronger than normal. But District ski resorts, with the exception of those in West Virginia, generally suffered because of little snowfall and unseasonably warm weather. The District's tourist businesses expect to have a good spring and summer. Almost all resort areas that were surveyed reported that bookings for the months ahead were heavier than usual.
District manufacturers remain optimistic about growth prospects in the nation and in their businesses for the next six months. Respondents expecting increases in activity outnumbered those expecting declines in each of the categories (shipments, new orders, etc.) covered by the survey.
