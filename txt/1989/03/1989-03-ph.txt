Indications from most sectors of the Third District economy in late February and early March suggest very moderate growth. Manufacturers are posting modest gains, with increases in shipments and orders, while employment is flat and order backlogs are edging down. Retailers say the first two months of the year ran about on plan, as dollar sales rose about 5-10 percent above last year's level. Auto dealers indicate that unit sales are running about even with the year-ago pace. Bankers report fairly steady growth in lending. but note that deposit growth is slipping.
The consensus outlook in the Third District business community is subdued. Manufacturers anticipate only steady activity over the next six months, although this is an improvement from January and February when they were forecasting a downturn. Retailers expect real sales this year to be around even with last year's results, but they say the spring season could be adversely affected by the early Easter. Auto dealers believe they can match last year's unit sales as long as interest rates hold steady or increase only "moderately.' Bankers foresee some easing in business loan demand over the next two quarters but they expect both consumer and real estate lending to stay on their growth trends.
Survey respondents continue to report rising prices, although such indications do not appear to be as widespread this month as they have been for the past year. Nearly one-half of the firms polled for the March survey are paying higher prices for purchased goods compared to a month ago and one-quarter are charging more for their own products.
Local manufacturers forecast only steady activity for the next six months, an improvement from the January and February surveys in which expectations of a downturn prevailed. The balance of responses to the most recent poll indicates that managers at area plants expect the rate of both new orders and shipments to be fairly flat for the next two quarters, and they anticipate a further decline in order backlogs. In accordance with these expectations, local firms' employment plans call for steady payrolls and some shortening of the workweek between now and September.
Third District automobile dealers report a pickup in sales in late January as manufacturers stepped up incentives in response to some mid-January slowness. Dealers believe that matching last year's rate of unit sales is possible this year as long as consumer Income remains strong and interest rates do not rise sharply. Nevertheless, dealers say their profit margins remain under pressure from rising costs and declining gross receipts.
Most of the bankers contacted for this report anticipate an easing in the expansion of commercial and industrial lending as the year progresses. Although they do not foresee a substantial slackening in overall economic activity in the next two quarters, they do believe credit demand by businesses will ease. Most expect consumer and real estate lending to continue growing at their current rates through the greater part of this year and possibly beyond.
The rate of growth in bank deposits continues on the slowing trend that began last November, according to Third District bankers. Demand deposits have fallen since the start of the year, and bankers say some of that money has been shifted into interest-bearing accounts. In order to maintain asset growth, some bankers say they are more likely to boost deposit rates to gather funds than to borrow in the money markets given the current interest rate differential. However, others believe the recent run-up in rates will be short-lived, and they will accept slower asset growth temporarily in anticipation of lower funding costs later this year.
