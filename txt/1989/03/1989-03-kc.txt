Much of the district's winter wheat crop is under weather-related stress. Warm early winter temperatures and a lack of snow cover left the crop vulnerable to subsequent cold weather, but the extent of damage is not yet known. Some areas of the district have recently received beneficial rains, but subsoil moisture reserves remain below normal. Additional rainfall is needed to ensure development of the crop through the remainder of the growing season.
Despite continued high cattle prices, little expansion has occurred in district cattle herds. Operators are generally maintaining herds at current levels. Inadequate wheat pasture in some areas of the district and high feed prices have discouraged ranchers from enlarging herds.
