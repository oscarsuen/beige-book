Developments of recent weeks have not altered the outlook for the economy and for inflation, according to Fourth District respondents. They are optimistic that nonresidential fixed investment will increase more this year than last because of further strengthening in traditional capital goods industries. Retailers, buoyed by much stronger-than-expected spending since last fall, are optimistic over consumer spending at least through the spring. Financial industry respondents do not yet see signs of slower loan growth because of higher interest rates. Thrifts are very competitively pricing CDs, although many experienced another loss of deposits in February.
Steel producers have been operating at or near capacity, and expect to continue to do so at least through the second quarter. Flat-rolled steel products are still on allocation, although there is excess capacity for steel consumed by the construction and petroleum industries. Lead times are lengthening to as much as 10 weeks because of strong orders that may reflect hedge-buying. Steel respondents expect that a let up in consumption and in inventory buildup in the second half will ease pressures on operating rates and end the allocation of steel now in tight supply.
Auto dealers report February sales were averaging a little below average for this time of year and assert that publicity about rising interest rates has begun to affect sales. Many auto dealers are offering special financing plans at below-market rates. Dealers are generally optimistic over spring sales, however, unless interest rates continue to increase.
Thrift institutions experienced another net deposit outflow in February, although not as severe as in January. Even some large, well-capitalized thrifts have outflows nearly as large or larger than in January. A large thrift reversed its massive January outflow in February, but solely on the basis of its newly introduced CD that is competitive with Treasury bill yields. Another experienced its second successive monthly net inflow of deposits by very aggressive pricing of its CDs.
