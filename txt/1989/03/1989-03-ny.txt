Recent reports on District developments have tended to be generally on the positive side. Retail sales were mixed during January, but showed some signs of improvement in February. Reports on upstate New York business conditions indicate a strong new orders picture and an optimistic outlook for 1989, but with indications of capacity pressures and rising input prices. Unemployment in the District continues below the national average, though the unemployment rate in New York State did rise on a year-to-year basis in January and employment growth in the District has been slower than in the nation as a whole. The demand for new housing remains generally weak in the District, but a slight increase in buyer interest has been noted recently and office leasing activity has picked up. Following the actions of major banks, small and medium-sized banks raised there prime lending rate a full percentage point in February.
A survey of major consumer electronics firms in the District found that during the 1988 Christmas season, stores posted strong over-the-year gains of 20 to 30 percent, in sharp contrast to the past two years. Firms are cautiously optimistic about future demand since, at a recent trade show, a number of them commented about a shortage of televisions and VCRs.
The percentage of surveyed Buffalo purchasing managers reporting increased new orders rose in January to its highest level since late l987 while the percentage reporting higher input prices also showed a sharp rise. Elsewhere in western New York, 65 percent of the purchasing managers in Rochester's annual outlook survey anticipate an improvement in general business conditions during 1989 and 83 percent expect their capacity utilization to top 90 percent this year.
Among recent developments in the District, plans were announced to build a new police academy and a large middle income housing complex in the South Bronx. The complex is to include almost 300 units in new two-family homes on a 40-acre site now containing dilapidated and burned-out buildings. In the Buffalo area Du Pont will undertake a multimillion-dollar expansion of its plant and Ford Motor will make a major investment in new equipment at its stamping plant. Elsewhere, Crouse-Hinds approved a multimillion-dollar project to modernize its iron and aluminum foundries in Syracuse; and in Connecticut, the Stamford Urban Redevelopment Commission has chosen a builder for a large, mixed-use downtown project. As part of a plan to bring residents and nightlife to the city's center, it will include housing, restaurants, cinemas and medical office space.
Office leasing activity picked up further in recent weeks and several areas with relatively high vacancy rates report some improvement. Demand from tenants requiring small to mid-sized space was especially strong in midtown Manhattan while some renewed interest from securities and financial services firms was noted downtown. Leasing activity on Long Island and in Fairfield County has also been good and some observers state that the worst of the Fairfield overbuilding is now past. Office vacancy rates in Westchester and northern New Jersey have moved down as a result of virtually no new construction in the former and a slowdown in new undertakings in the latter. However, with almost 7 million square feet of new office space scheduled for completion this year inmidtown Manhattan and more than 2 million on Long Island, higher vacancy rates are expected there.
