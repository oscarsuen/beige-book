Residential building has slowed, but mainly apartments. Construction of homes remains at a fairly high pace. Residential building contracts in District state' last year were 4 percent below 1987, when they reached a high for the 1980s. Mortgage interest rates have risen, with quotes on Chicago area thirty year fixed-rate loans averaging 10.7 percent in the latest week and initial rates on adjustables averaging 8.6 percent. Higher interest rates are expected to dampen residential construction activity in 1989.
Unit retail sales of farm tractors and combines in District states fell 4 percent last year, the ninth consecutive annual decline. Nationwide, tractor and combine sales rose nearly 5 percent, despite a marked drought-related slowdown in the second half. Initial reports show January sales below a year ago. However, analysts expect a sizable rise (10 to 20 percent) in sales for all of 1989.
