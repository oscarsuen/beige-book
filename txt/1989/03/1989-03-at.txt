Some price softness is occurring in construction and related markets. Except for cement, where imports to the region have declined, building materials prices are soft. Lumber and plywood prices at retail are reported to be up 2 1/2 percent over the last 12 months. Overbuilding has resulted in lower effective lease rates in strip shopping centers, helping to keep chain grocery store costs down; however, the drought's effects have raised food costs.
In agriculture, egg prices have nearly doubled from a year ago and broilers, also up in price, could go even higher this year as the supply of competing red meats is expected to become tighter. Growing international grain and soybean exports are reported to be raising these commodity prices. The price of domestically-produced furniture is up only marginally whereas those on imported merchandise are showing strong gains.
Excess capacity is expected to grow in the construction and building materials industries despite strength in the remodeling segment; slowing public infrastructure investment is said to be a new drag on activity this year. The volume of excess retail trade, office building, and hotel space is growing. While construction of new space has slowed, it is still greater than absorption. Excess capacity typifies portions of the textile and apparel industries where foreign competition is strong.
