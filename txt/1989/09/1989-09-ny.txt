District activity continues to be basically mixed but with some recent signs of strengthening. Retail contacts reported over-the-year sales gains during July and August that, for the most part, were on or above targeted levels. Unemployment rates in the District have bounced around in recent months, but remain slightly below the national average.  Buffalo purchasing managers report improved business conditions.  In contrast, demand for new housing continued mixed, with some areas noting price declines, and office leasing activity slowed somewhat in its usual summer pattern. Most small- and medium-sized banks stated that they have not lowered rates on consumer loans since the latest decrease in the prime rate.
Inventories at the end of August were generally described as satisfactory. One retailer continued to have stocks above desired levels, but greatly reduced from the previous two months, while another reported an actual shortage of fall merchandise which he expected to be rectified in September.
Office leasing activity slowed somewhat since the last report in its usual summer patters.  Several new buildings were completed in midtown Manhattan which had tenant commitments for less than half their space, while in downtown Manhattan a sizable amount of existing prime office space was also placed on the market. As a result, the vacancy rate for prime space has increased somewhat in both these areas, though the rates remain below the national average. Office vacancy rates in most other District areas showed little change in recent weeks.
The August survey of Buffalo purchasing managers reversed the July pattern, showing a sharp rise in firms with improved orders and production and a decline in those experiencing a worsening. August data for Rochester are not yet available but in July, 90 percent of surveyed managers there anticipated stable to improved conditions over the next three months after some deterioration from June to July.
Eastman Kodak recently announced that it will lay off an additional 4500 workers this year, but it did not specify how many would be affected at its Rochester, New York headquarters. On Long Island a final decision has not yet been made public with regard to the Pentagon's plan to cancel Navy aircraft contracts at the Gruman plant. Among other recent developments which could have an adverse impact on the District's economy, two of New York's oldest retail chains—B. Altman and Bonwit Teller—filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a result of their parent company's financial difficulties, and a large furniture chain was unable to meet its interest payments and began discussing debt restructuring with its lenders.
