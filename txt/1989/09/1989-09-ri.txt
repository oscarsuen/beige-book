A telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts in the District indicated an increase in tourism this summer compared to last summer. Most respondents expect tourist activity to continue better than a year ago in coming months.
District manufacturers were less optimistic than in July about prospects for growth in their businesses in the next six months. Respondents who expect declines in sales, new orders, unfilled orders, employment, and the length of the workweek slightly outnumbered those who expect increases. Textile producers, for example, expect demand to decline soon because of a recent increase in the volume of imports. In all manufacturing, the number of respondents who expect decreases in overall U.S. economic activity in the next six months remained above the number who expect increases, while the number who expect no change remained about the same.
Income prospects for District farmers are good, with cash receipts possibly exceeding the relatively strong 1988 showing. Further adding to farmers' financial security are rising farmland values. All District states are experiencing rising values, but particularly Maryland and Virginia, where increases in land values over the last year exceeded 10 percent.
