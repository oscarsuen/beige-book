Producers of aluminum expect continuing good business after record business last year. The sources of strength are large orders from aircraft producers and strong export demand. From a year ago, exports of aluminum have been up by 50 percent. Weaker auto and appliance sales have not affected aluminum production so far, but producers expect some inventory buildup by the end of the year. A manufacturer of kitchen appliances reports that although 1989 started out strong, production over the past few months has been below last year's level by about 15 percent; he expects production to remain weak for the rest of the year.
Contacts in the textile and apparel industry have reported concern about competition from imports, although strong domestic demand has been able to absorb both imported goods and domestic production. One producer notes that there has been a slight easing in the costs of raw materials like cotton and chemicals recently. Another, describing his outlook as "guardedly optimistic," reports that capital spending will continue at the same level for the next three years, a level he considers substantial.
Auto sales in August are reported to be up substantially over previous months as a result of manufacturer rebates, although sales in the Sixth District were somewhat weaker than the rest of the nation. It is feared, however, that the recent gains may be at the expense of reduced sales in 1990.
The health care industry has reported that the shortage of nurses has eased recently. Efforts to increase enrollments in nursing programs seem to be paying off.
