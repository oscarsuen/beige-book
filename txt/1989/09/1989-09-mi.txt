Ninth District economic conditions have been mixed. The Minnesota labor market has continued to display signs of weakness, while the employment situation in the rest of the district has improved. Consumer spending on general merchandise has been strong, automobile sales have risen sharply from levels earlier in the year, and housing activity has shown signs of improvement. Conditions in resource-related industries have been mixed.
The unemployment rate in North Dakota declined to 3.8 percent in July from 4.6 percent in June and 4.4 percent in July 1988. The unemployment rate in South Dakota was 4.0 percent in July, 0.2 percentage points lower than in June and 0.5 percentage points higher than in July 1988. In Montana, the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent in July, from 6.0 percent in June and 6.5 percent in July 1988. The unemployment rate in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan dropped to 6.0 percent in July from 7.5 percent in June.
Automobile sales have continued to recover rapidly from a poor first quarter. One domestic manufacturer reports that sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in August were 25 percent higher than in August 1988 and were about even on a year-to-date basis compared to last year. Another domestic manufacturer reports that sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area were 22 percent higher in August than in August 1988 and 5 percent higher on a year-to-date basis. Automobile dealers were generally optimistic about sales prospects for the new model year.
Housing activity has also rebounded from its depressed levels earlier in the year. In Minnesota, the number of new housing permits issued in June was roughly the same as in June 1988. Earlier this year, the number of new housing permits issued was as much as 30 percent below the levels of last year. Housing sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area were 6.3 percent higher in August than in August 1988 but 3.4 percent lower on a year-to-date basis. Nonresidential construction has not fared as well. The dollar value of contracts for future construction in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area was 25 percent lower in July than in July 1988 and about 15 percent lower on a year-to-date basis.
Tourist spending has been fairly strong. North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana have been celebrating their centennial year as states in the Union, and all three states report very good tourist seasons. One observer reports that in some areas of Montana it was nearly impossible to find lodging. The city of Northfield, Minnesota, anticipates that over 100,000 people will turnout for its annual "Defeat of Jesse James Days," the reenactment of the shootout between the citizens of Northfield and the James Gang in 1876.
