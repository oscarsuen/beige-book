The St. Louis unemployment rate declined 0.1 percentage points to 5.2 percent in July despite temporary layoffs of 4,000 auto workers. One labor analyst expects the jobless rate to drop even lower in August, then remain near 5 percent for the rest of the year.
Although District job growth has generally been sluggish, labor shortages have become more severe over the last year. Little change in the availability of unskilled workers was reported, but finding qualified skilled workers is increasingly difficult for manufacturing, wholesale/retail trades, finance and services firms. For the rest of 1989, businesses surveyed in the District expect little change in overall economic conditions and most plan no substantial changes in the size of their workforce or inventories in the next few months. Among the District's major metropolitan areas, employment opportunities were expected to be most limited in Louisville, where construction job reductions are expected.
Although slight gains were reported this summer, District residential construction growth remains sluggish. The value of District residential contracts issued in the first seven months of 1989 is virtually identical to that of a year earlier, with building of multi-family dwellings particularly weak.
