Deposit flows at district savings and loan institutions have mostly held steady over the past month, although a few respondents have noticed a slight outflow of funds. Respondents expect steady deposit flows in coming months, with slightly increased inflows expected only after press coverage of the new savings and loan legislation dies down. Mortgage demand has been down modestly over the summer months, and respondents expect a further seasonal decline during the winter. Respondents report stable mortgage rates and believe rates will remain steady or drop slightly in the coming months.
The rains have improved range and pasture conditions across most of the district. Adequate forage and strong cattle prices are encouraging district cattle ranchers to expand herds. The limited supply of young cattle available is likely to maintain high feeder cattle prices that, in turn, will limit profits for district cattle feeders.
In the parts of the district where the drought was most severe, bankers expect a slight decline in farm loan repayment rates. Well-targeted federal drought relief, however, will be of greatest benefit to those farmers suffering the greatest losses. On balance, agricultural credit conditions in the district continue to improve.
