Machinery markets have turned increasingly mixed over the course of this year, after widespread improvement last year. Sales of construction equipment are below last year, except highway construction equipment, which is higher. Mining equipment sales are quite strong, partly to meet long deferred replacement demand, but a general decline in minerals prices is expected to lead to lower sales next year. Diesel engine demand, robust virtually across the board earlier this year, is less vigorous with some markets softer including heavy trucks, marine equipment, and generating equipment. Machine tool orders have slowed while shipments have picked up, eroding backlogs. Farm equipment demand has strengthened substantially this year.
Though motor vehicle sales have picked up in the third quarter, this rise is attributed by observers to enhanced incentives and concerns about higher prices in the 1990 model year. A contact with a supplier to the industry thinks planned fourth quarter production cuts may be inadequate to bring inventories back into line. However, the sharp cuts in auto assemblies scheduled by the "Big Three" are being partly offset by large increases at plants partly or wholly owned by foreign companies, most of which are located in or near this District and are supplied by components makers located here. Shipments of medium duty trucks have slowed, and orders for heavy trucks, strong early in the year, have softened.
