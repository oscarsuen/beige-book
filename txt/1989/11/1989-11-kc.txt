The Tenth District economy appears to be growing moderately. Retail sales have been steady over the past three months. Retail prices and prices of manufacturers' inputs have changed little in recent months. Most retailers are satisfied with their inventory levels, but manufacturers continue to trim their materials inventories. Drilling activity continues to increase. Housing activity is soft. Loan demand at commercial banks has increased slightly. Fall crop yields are average to slightly above average, and agricultural credit conditions remain stable.
Most savings and loan respondents experienced net inflows of deposits over the past month. Mortgage demand has softened. While mortgage rates have recently been relatively steady, most respondents expect a slight decline through the remainder of the year.
District cattle ranchers continue to benefit from strong feeder cattle prices. Despite strong cattle prices, however, expansion of district cattle herds was restricted by drought-reduced feed supplies earlier in the year. A limited supply of young cattle available for herd expansion and placement in feedlots has maintained the high cost of feeder cattle and, in turn, has limited profits for district cattle feeders.
Agricultural credit conditions in the district remain stable. Strong wheat and feeder cattle prices continue to support farm incomes across most of the district. Crop insurance benefits, federal drought relief payments, and financial reserves built up in recent years will help farmers in some parts of the district to withstand the 1989 drought.
