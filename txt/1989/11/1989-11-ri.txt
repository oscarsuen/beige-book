District manufacturers were somewhat more optimistic than in August about prospects for growth in their businesses in the next six months. Respondents who expect increases in sales, new orders, and employment outnumbered those who expect declines. However, more manufacturers anticipate decreases than increases in unfilled orders and the length of the workweek.
The effects of Hurricane Hugo on the industrial base of South Carolina and North Carolina appear to be small. Most textile plants were not located in the path of the storm, and we have no reports of damage to furniture plants, although Hugo traveled directly through some of the major furniture production areas of the Carolinas and Virginia.
Power outages did reduce industrial production somewhat. For example, furniture production in North Carolina, where about 25 percent of U.S. furniture is manufactured, declined about 1 to 2 percent during September. Pulp and paper production was also reduced somewhat by power outages and, apparently, because some logging roads were temporarily impassable.
According to South Carolina's Division of Travel and Tourism Development, 85 percent of the hotels in the Charleston area have reopened. About one-third of the hotel business for the month was lost because of the hurricane. Fall bookings are about the same as last year.
The demand for home mortgage loans appeared to strengthen in most parts of the District in the last thirty days, although reports from the Washington, D.C. area were mixed. Elsewhere in the District, a few lenders reported a slight downturn in mortgage loan activity, but the majority said that the demand for mortgage loans was at or above the levels of the previous month.
Hurricane Hugo did extensive damage to the agricultural sectors in both South Carolina and North Carolina. In South Carolina, USDA estimates total crop losses at roughly $80 million, with cotton, corn, and soybeans all hard hit. Structural damage totaled about $270 million. Estimates of livestock damage were incomplete, but thousands of head of cattle and hogs were reportedly destroyed, along with 2.7 million chickens and turkeys. Overall losses to the South Carolina farm sector are believed to be close to $1 billion.
In North Carolina, USDA estimates total crop losses were near $40 million, with corn accounting for about half of the total. Poultry industry losses were also approximately $40 million. Total damage is estimated to be in the vicinity of $175 million.
