Shipments of steel were expected to be below a year earlier in the second half, after being higher in the first half of 1989. Industrial procurement of steel has peaked, as a large number of large projects moved off of drawing boards to the procurement stage in 1988 and early 1989. There are now fewer big projects being started, but numerous smaller ones. This has resulted in a peaking and subsequent easing of pressures on available capacity, but many projects remain underway, and this backlog will tend to support activity in the months ahead.
The outlook for steel also reflects an expectation that automakers will produce close to announced schedules for the rest of this year. Contacts in the auto industry were optimistic about maintaining reduced assembly schedules. These production cuts are being reflected at parts plants in the District.
Reports on residential sales are mixed. Some realtors indicate relatively good volumes of business following declines in mortgage interest rates from peaks last spring, but others view sales as sluggish. There are indications of weakening in housing prices. Some realtors regard property sales as soft partly because sellers have exaggerated views of what their properties are worth. Affordability is a problem for many would-be buyers. On the other hand, houses that are selling include numerous larger and more expensive properties.
