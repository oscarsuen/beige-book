Retailers of domestic and imported new cars reported mixed consumer behavior in August and September. A few dealers of domestic cars reported their sales in September were "very good," which greatly improved their inventory position. A few other dealers, however, reported flat sales and price incentives were insufficient to reduce their inventories. October sales so far have been lackluster, and most auto dealers appear reluctant to carry large inventories of 1990 models.
Some traditional capital goods producers report a more-than-expected slowdown in business. Construction machinery sales have been slackening in response to weakening in residential and nonresidential construction. Heavy-duty truck orders, which were at peak levels late last year and early this year because of anticipated price increases, slumped during the summer months and did not revive in September as much as expected, suggesting a relatively soft first quarter production schedule.
