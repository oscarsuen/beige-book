The pace of economic growth is reported as slow to moderate in most Federal Reserve districts. Consumer spending is mixed, with a number of districts describing retail sales as steady to growing slowly. Manufacturing activity is also mixed, with some districts reporting weakness in orders and shipments. Weakness of construction in some markets contrasts with evidence of some improvement elsewhere. Resource industries, including the energy sector, appear to be improving, as is agriculture generally. Loan demand at commercial banks continues to vary by region and type of loan.
Significant variations in manufacturing performance also exist across industries. Minneapolis says "troubles have continued to mount in the computer and electronics industries," citing recent employment reductions by Minnesota computer manufacturers. But Cleveland notes that orders for office equipment may be leveling out, following a decline. And Chicago says the slowdown in communications equipment demand appears to have bottomed out. Producers of construction machinery and heavy duty trucks in the Cleveland district report further slowdowns in orders and sales. Chicago reports steel shipments are down as "industrial procurement of steel has peaked," but that order backlogs will continue to support steel production. Auto industry contacts are optimistic about maintaining current assembly schedules, and shipments of large farm tractors and combines are well above those of a year ago. St. Louis reports declines in manufacturing employment in several sectors, with recent layoffs by makers of autos and home appliances. San Francisco reports capacity constraints in commercial aircraft manufacturing still exist but are no longer worsening.
Nonresidential construction activity also varies among districts. Signs of weakness in nonresidential building are present in the St. Louis district. Office construction continues to be slow in the Atlanta district, but some manufacturing plant expansions are underway. Construction is holding up well in much of the Chicago district, as evidenced by strength in shipments of construction materials. Commercial building in downtown Chicago remains at a high level. Dallas reports a mild improvement in nonresidential building. Office vacancy rates, though still high, are falling in most cities in the Dallas district, and industrial vacancy rates are also falling. Office leasing activity has picked up recently in the NewYork district, especially in midtown Manhattan. Construction and real estate activity have been strong in the San Francisco district, except in Arizona.
Minneapolis reports moderately strong tourist activity. Yellowstone National Park received a large number of visitors this summer, but their spending was lower than expected. Tourist activity in the Richmond district is up from a year ago in spite of Charleston's lost business due to Hurricane Hugo. With about 85 percent of the city's hotels reopened, however, bookings for the fall are about the same as a year ago.
