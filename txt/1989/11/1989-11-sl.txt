The District economy continues to grow slowly. Despite record low unemployment levels in several District states, manufacturing employment has fallen in several sectors, and both residential and nonresidential construction are showing signs of weakness. Exports of manufactured goods, however, have been strong in recent months. Cool, wet weather has slowed the harvest of some District crops. Total lending by large commercial banks, especially for real estate, increased in the third quarter.
In the durables sector, most manufacturers report satisfactory inventory levels. Many are experiencing declining backlogs and slowdowns in new orders. Most manufacturers have no plans to hire new workers or make additions to physical capacity over the next three months. Several industries have laid off workers in recent months to reduce inventories, and more layoffs are scheduled through year-end. One auto assembly plant in St. Louis will lay off approximately 3,000 workers for four weeks beginning October 20 to reduce inventories of slow-selling models. Several analysts expect total District employment in the automobile sector to hold steady or decline through the rest of 1989 as higher prices for 1990 model cars depress sales. District home appliance manufacturers report declining sales and layoffs, citing higher 1989 interest rates, lagging home sales and economic uncertainty as the reasons consumers are postponing major purchases. Most manufacturers who export indicated that exports were up over last year and that sales have not been affected by recent exchange rate changes.
