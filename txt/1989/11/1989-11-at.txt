Several manufacturers are reporting falling prices for inputs such as freight charges and raw materials. The price of resins used in plastic goods has fallen steadily this year and continues to decline. Other producers, specifically producers of paper products, are indicating stable input prices and note no change in the price of their final product in the past six months, with none expected for the rest of the year. In contrast, several land and air freight firms report a recent rise in fuel costs. An air freight firm revealed that jet fuel prices have risen unexpectedly recently, and several trucking firms noted increased fuel costs. Even so, major carriers and independents alike still feel compelled to offer discounts on freight rates of 30 to 40 percent. Price competition among freight carriers is reported to be fierce.
Manufacturers still are willing to expand capacity in the Sixth District. A large paper firm in Louisiana has announced a substantial modernization program to begin next year, while a new textile plant will be opening on the site of a plant abandoned in 1986. Several chemical firms in Louisiana and Florida have recently announced plans to expand existing plants next year. Although the oil and gas industry has started to turn around, firms supplying drilling equipment are still delaying plans to expand capacity until the strength of the industry's recovery becomes clear.
