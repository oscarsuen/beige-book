Most respondents from district savings and loan institutions report net deposit outflows over the past month, although deposit flows were more mixed than last month or a year ago. Expectations for future deposit flows vary. Healthy savings institutions expect greater inflows, while troubled savings institutions expect greater outflows. Mortgage demand remains weak, with continued weakness expected until spring. Respondents report steady to slightly lower mortgage rates and believe rates will decline in coming months.
The supply of pastures and forages should be sufficient to meet livestock feeding needs throughout most of the district this winter. Where rainfall has not been sufficient to support grazing of the winter wheat crop, cattle herds are being sustained with hay and other forages. Ample forage supplies combined with strong cattle prices have encouraged some district cattle producers to begin expanding herds.
District bankers expect little change in generally strong farm credit conditions, but reduced crop yields and lower crop prices in some parts of the district may slow the rate of paydown and increase the carryover on farm operating loans. In most of the district, however, near-normal crop yields and strong livestock prices have maintained high farm incomes, leading district bankers to expect farm loan paydowns to reach last year's high level.
