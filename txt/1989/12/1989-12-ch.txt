Total payroll employment in District states has been little changed, seasonally adjusted, since early this year and manufacturing has fallen, with half of the decline at Michigan factories. The average unemployment rate in the District rose to 6.1 percent in September, highest this year, from a low of 5.0 percent in April. Michigan unemployment increased most among District states, but Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa also recorded sizable increases.
Surveys of purchasing managers in the District show a mixed pattern. Chicago purchasing managers reported an upturn in production and orders in October and less widespread declines in backlogs. Indianapolis purchasing managers, still seeing expansion, indicated that increases in production and orders in October were more widespread than last summer but less so than a year ago. Milwaukee purchasers say orders, production, and backlogs fell in October, continuing a shift from expansion to slowdown underway for more than a year.
Markets for many types of industrial machinery and equipment have continued to expand, though generally more slowly than last year. In some cases, sales have been stronger than expected. Sales have remained 3 to 4 percent above a year earlier throughout this year for a maker of electrical controls and supplies sold widely to manufacturers of industrial equipment including pumps, compressors, fans, motors, and other types of capital goods. A second-half slowdown anticipated by customers earlier this year has not materialized; sales remain as brisk as before. Another capital goods producer indicated that sales of food industry machinery are holding up reasonably well. Materials handling equipment sales weakened earlier but may be bottoming. Sales of farm tractors and implements are running well ahead of last year, and a manufacturer in the District expects a further gain in shipments next year to meet retail demand and build inventories. Heavy construction equipment demand has been firmer for road building and mining. Light construction equipment sales, chiefly for residential building as well as some road repair work, were reported weaker earlier this year, but one producer expects its sales in 1989 to exceed last year, and projects a further gain in 1990. Lower orders for metal-cutting machine tools this year are said mainly to reflect cutbacks by motor vehicle makers. The market for diesel engines is off sharply because of lower orders and production cuts at heavy truck manufacturers and a less robust picture for industrial diesels. Softness in the semiconductor market reflects cutbacks at motor vehicle manufacturers and less favorable prospects for other end-markets.
Steel producers also are cutting shipments to motor vehicle manufacturers, but industrial and construction demands for steel are holding up well. Calendar-year 1989 shipments, previously forecast to be below 1988. are now expected to be higher. The pace of investment in projects making heavy use of steel has stayed strong in chemicals and the paper industry, as well as for investment in steel mills themselves. Sales of steel for use in commercial construction are also described as doing well. Starts on new projects have slowed, but may pick up as uncertainties over pollution abatement requirements are resolved.
Barge rates and the demand for rail cars have firmed considerably this fall in response to large grain shipments to the USSR. While not unprecedented, the volume of Soviet grain shipments will stress the domestic transportation network. A major bottleneck at the soon-to-be-replaced Alton (Illinois) Lock and Dam on the Mississippi River has resurfaced with the pick-up in barge traffic. Low water levels on both the Mississippi and the Missouri River could further limit barge traffic or result in an early, season-ending closure to traffic on the upper portions of those rivers.
