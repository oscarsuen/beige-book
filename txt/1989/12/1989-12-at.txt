Input prices have been reported to be mostly stable or falling in some instances. Construction materials prices do not appear to be under pressure. Building materials prices are expected to remain stable or decline until construction picks up. A producer of wood building materials says that the price pressures usually seen this time of year are absent. Prices of metals like aluminum and copper are expected to remain stable into next year. Prices for communications equipment are also stable or declining. Several trucking firms have reported that freight rates have been falling owing to excess capacity in the industry. Even though volume is as good as in 1988, total revenue is down.
Spending on capital goods continues to hold up in the Southeast, although there have been a few reports of plans having been revised down recently. Much spending involves purchases of new equipment rather than capacity expansion. Producers of industrial pumps, fabricated aluminum, and processed food report plans to update older machinery. Several wood and pulp producers have announced plans to expand capacity because of strong overseas demand. A large producer of building materials, however, reports recent cuts in capital spending plans for 1990 by 50 percent. Their purchases of new equipment have been put on hold until construction activity picks up.
