Developments have varied among sectors of the Second District economy since the last report with no clear sign of overall deterioration or improvement. Department store sales were generally on plan and the pace of office leasing was good. Demand for new homes remained mixed, however, and purchasing managers in Buffalo and Rochester noted some flattening of new orders and overall business conditions. Senior officers at small and midsized banks reported demand for home mortgages slowed over the year.
The current level of inventories was characterized as manageable by most department store contacts though one retailer reported stocks above desired levels. In addition, some District stores that are subsidiaries of financially-strapped companies are reportedly somewhat understocked because of suppliers' concerns about being paid. Regarding the near-tern outlook, liquidation of the 124-year old B. Altman's chain is producing uncertainty among some District retailers because of the possibility of substantial price-cutting during the current holiday season.
The pace of office leasing has been good in much of the District but with the recent completion of substantial amounts of new space, vacancy rates have generally held steady or edged higher. Moreover, some New York City brokerage firms recently announced further staff reductions in their continuing cost-cutting efforts. These moves could throw additional office space on the downtown Manhattan market, where vacancy rates have already risen due to earlier restructuring by financial firms, even though no new buildings are currently planned there.
October unemployment rates of 4.7 percent and 5.1 percent in New York and New Jersey, respectively, were again below the national average. However, October was the first month in three years that New Jersey's rate was above 5 percent and the unemployment outlook for the District is uncertain. In the wake of relatively weak investor volume and a slowdown in new issues and merger and acquisition activity, several brokerage firms recently announced plans for additional cutbacks totaling some 1200 employees. Some observers expect this number to climb even higher as more restructuring occurs in the securities industry. Further layoffs are also occurring at some auto parts manufacturers as a result of sluggish demand for cars. On the other hand, while demand for autos is slow, interest in new minivans is reportedly strong enough to beboosting employment at minivan parts and assembly plants in the District. Moreover, the House of Representatives voted for the production of 18 more F-14 fighter planes, which could maintain employment levels on Long Island.
