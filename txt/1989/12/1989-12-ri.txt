Our November survey showed that most manufacturers remained optimistic about prospects for the U.S. economy and their own businesses, although they were somewhat less optimistic about the near-term outlook than in our previous survey. Most producers expect the nation's economy to grow at a slow to moderate rate during the next 18 months. Almost half of the respondents, however, up from one-third in September, expect a decrease in the nation's rate of economic expansion over the next six months. The percentage of respondents who expect a decrease in their own shipments in the next six months rose to 40 percent in November from 25 percent in September. The percentage planning to maintain or increase capital spending in the next six months declined slightly but remained high.
Reports from sources other than those surveyed by mail provided some specifics on District activity in particular industries in recent weeks. In the Carolinas, the furniture, textile, and apparel industries reduced their workweeks because of slow sales. In West Virginia, however, coal production was at a record pace and coal prices were strong. Timber production also maintained a robust pace in West Virginia and other District states.
Reports from the three major District ports—Hampton Roads (Norfolk), Charleston, and Baltimore—indicated that overall activity was mixed in October. Imports rose from September levels at Hampton Roads and Charleston, but declined at Baltimore. Exports increased at Charleston, decreased at. Baltimore, and remained about the same at Hampton Roads.
Comments by realtors and others confirmed the builders' reports of softness in the District housing market in November. Sales of both new and existing homes were reported to be down in all but a few metropolitan areas. Some realtors reported an increase in open house traffic, which they attributed to good weather and lower mortgage rates.
A number of bankers commented on the high level of consumer debt and noted an increase in their consumer loan losses and delinquencies. Others saw problems ahead in particular sectors, such as commercial real estate and automobile dealerships.
