Several respondents, however, note slower orders for manufactured goods. Moreover, a heavy equipment manufacturer reports that export sales were down 1 percent during the third quarter compared to their year-earlier level. A paint and coatings manufacturer reports that most of the companies his firm deals with have experienced a slowdown during recent months. Recent performance varies widely among high-technology manufacturers, as one respondent reports that lower chip prices have hurt semiconductor producers.
Agricultural industries report healthy conditions, with strong export growth. California farm exports are expected to be about 10 percent higher in 1989 than they were in 1988, with exports of nuts, fruits, and vegetables particularly strong. Livestock operators are doing well, with steady increases in exports. Wine exports are starting to "take off," particularly to the U.K and Japan. The extent of earthquake damage suffered by food processors and by flower and nursery greenhouse operators in Watsonville, Gilroy, and Hollister remains unknown.
