Most Federal Reserve districts describe economic activity as stable to modestly expanding, though two note some recent softening. Consumer spending has varied among districts. Strength has been mostly confined to nondurable items, while sales of autos and other durables have generally been weak. The majority of districts report some softening in manufacturing activity but there are pockets of strength. Construction is strong or improving in the West and Midwest but somewhat sluggish in other areas. Agriculture has improved in much of the country and several resource industries have been expanding. Those districts that reported on price developments generally noted flat to modestly increased input prices, with several mentioning the continuing escalation of medical insurance costs. Loan demand at commercial banks varied by type and region.
Retail inventories were reported at satisfactory levels in Atlanta, Minneapolis, New York and Philadelphia, but are higher than desired in Boston and Chicago. Retailers in Boston, Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Richmond expect this holiday season to equal last year's while those in Kansas City and St. Louis appear to be somewhat more optimistic.
Weakness in the auto industry and among its suppliers was most commonly cited as a major factor in the manufacturing slowdown. Softness was also reported in the computer, electronics and defense industries in Minneapolis and in the furniture, textiles and apparel industries in Richmond.
In the nonauto sectors of the transportation equipment industry some gains occurred. Cleveland noted an upturn in orders for heavy-duty trucks and several districts reported strength at aerospace-related firms. Cleveland and Chicago report expansion in the industrial machinery industry, while firms producing oilfield equipment and chemicals in Dallas increased their sales. Several food processing plants in the San Francisco district plan to expand and Atlanta reports that capital spending continues in the chemicals, metals, wood and pulp, and industrial equipment industries.
Nonresidential construction and real estate activity also is mixed, Boston, Atlanta and Minneapolis report some weakness in the commercial market and New York and St. Louis note some recent increases in vacancy rates. However, office leasing has been relatively strong in New York, and Atlanta and Chicago both mention continuing strength in industrial construction.
Among natural resources industries, exploration for natural gas is boosting drilling activity in Kansas City, and Dallas reports that the oil and gas industry is optimistic about expanding next year. Richmond notes that coal prices are strong and coal production in West Virginia has been at a record level. Minneapolis and Richmond report robust activity in the lumber industry, and the mining and metals industries are strong in San Francisco and Minneapolis.
