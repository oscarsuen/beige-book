Several industries, however, have stated that their business is starting to improve. Oil and gas drilling is up. The increase has been strongest in natural gas exploration in the Gulf, but one contact says that the recent stability in oil prices has begun to restore some confidence among oil drillers. This is showing up in increases in orders for drilling equipment from Louisiana suppliers. A manufacturer of air conditioning equipment reported that his firm has been running close to capacity recently with no sign of slowdown anticipated. He attributed the strength in orders to remodeling andreplacement rather than to new building construction. Producers of communications and electronic equipment in Georgia state that business is still strong and that they do not expect much, if any, slowing in their industry. The one weak spot in communication and electronic equipment sales has been in federal government orders.
Several financial institutions pointed out that because of growth in home equity lines of credit, consumer loans have increased recently. Two lenders noted that there has been some increase in ARM mortgage lending, although they remain somewhat cautious in their outlook. A few other bankers noted, however, that borrowers seem to have become more hesitant to take out new loans in light of general reports of a slowing economy. Auto loans are widely reported being down.
Feed costs have remained stable owing to recent rains in the Midwest, although District fertilizer demand and costs have fallen because heavy rains in the Southeast have reduced planting substantially.
