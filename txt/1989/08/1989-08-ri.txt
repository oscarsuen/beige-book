District manufacturers continue to be more optimistic about prospects for their own businesses than for general business activity in the nation. Respondents who expect increases in sales and unfilled orders in the next six months slightly outnumbered those who expect declines. The majority look for employment and the workweek at their respective plants to remain at current levels. Only one District producer in five, however, expects the general economy to improve over the next six months, while two in five expect it to decline.

Several respondents said reduced mortgage rates had not resulted in   heavier customer traffic but had allowed buyers to purchase more   expensive homes.
The District's lumber industry has apparently benefited from strong   foreign demand that has largely offset the weakness in domestic   demand due to softness in construction. Foreign buyers of lumber   were said to have bought all grades and to have paid top prices.
