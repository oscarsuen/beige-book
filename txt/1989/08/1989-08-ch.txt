Preliminary results from our latest survey of District bankers suggest that farmland values continued to edge up in the second quarter, but at a slower pace than in earlier periods. The second quarter rise of 1 percent compares to gains of about 3 percent in each of the previous three quarters. The slowing was particularly evident in Illinois and Iowa where lingering drought concerns prevailed throughout the second quarter.
