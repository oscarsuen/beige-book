Most of the respondents doubt that a soft landing will succeed in reducing the inflation rate. They expect that inflation will remain sticky in a 4.5 percent to 5 percent range, even though the growth rate of real GNP is expected to be below the growth rate of potential output for the next several quarters. Most expect that inflation in the second half of 1989 will be less than in the first half because of improving supplies of farm products and energy. An energy economist expects petroleum prices will ease in the second half, and that crude oil prices will fall to the low end of an $18 to $20 per barrel range. All but two respondents believe that a 4.5 percent inflation rate is too high and are concerned that further easing in interest rates might revive economic growth and fuel accelerating inflation.
A major retailer expects real consumer spending will increase at about a 1.5 percent annual rate this half, and that more "specials" will be offered in order to stimulate sales.
A major appliance producer expects sluggishness in consumer spending for major household goods in the second half in response to the softening in housing. He also noted no favorable consumer response yet to the decline in mortgage rates.
Steel producers foresee a larger than seasonal decline in their business during the third quarter, mostly because of production cutbacks in the auto industry. They believe that the boom in steel is over. Flat-rolled steel products remain on allocation by at least one major producer, although conditions are not as tight as they were earlier this year. Another producer removed all steel from allocation. Second-half steel shipments and production are expected to soften from the first half.
