The pattern of developments in the Second District continued to be mixed across sectors. Some retailers reported sales well above plan, while others experienced demand that met or fell below targeted levels. Upstate New York reports on new orders, production, and general business conditions indicate some leveling off. Nevertheless, more respondents continued to report gains in these areas than reported declines. Office leasing activity in the District has maintained a moderately strong pace. The pace of homebuilding activity has been uneven across the District, and based on a survey of small- to medium-sized banks, demand for residential real estate credit has weakened.
With the exception of one store, which had stocks well above desired levels, department store contacts described their inventories as being in good shape. In one case, this was due to unusually heavy markdowns, which were being continued in July.
Office leasing activity has continued at a moderately strong pace since the last report as Manhattan's largest lease of the year was signed for space in a 40-story midtown building scheduled for completion in 1992. Vacancy rates declined in several parts or the District including northern New Jersey and Suffolk and Westchester counties (N.Y.). Rates moved higher in some other areas, however, including downtown Manhattan where downsizing or merging financial firms are adding to the available supply of office space.
June unemployment rates of 4.2 percent and 5.0 percent in New Jersey and New York, respectively, were again below the national average. Nevertheless, the growth in second District nonfarm employment has increasingly lagged the national pace since l986. In large part this results from continued declines in manufacturing employment in the District. In addition, some nonmanufacturing industries are growing more slowly than elsewhere in the nation. As a result of this and other developments, much discussion is going on in government and private circles regarding what can be done for the region to maintain its competitive position.
Several new projects were announced or undertaken in recent weeks. The Mahwah, New Jersey, United Parcel Service broke ground for a computer and telecommunications center which will be part of a $1.4 billion investment in its worldwide operations. In Monmouth County plans have been announced for two large mixed-use projects which it is hoped will revitalize an old resort area. Ground was also broken in northeastern New York for a $50 million mall scheduled to open next year, and downstate plans were announced for a major expansion of the New Rochelle mall.
