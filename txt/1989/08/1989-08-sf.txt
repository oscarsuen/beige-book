Overall economic conditions in the Twelfth Federal Reserve District continue healthy, although the pace of growth appears to have slowed from that seen earlier this year. Retail sales growth is satisfactory but not robust, with weakness in "big-ticket" items including automobiles. Manufacturing activity continues healthy, with strength in commercial aircraft and relatively slow growth in electronics. Most western fruit and vegetable producers are having a good year, although concerns about food safety have hurt sales of apples and table grapes. Log shortages in the Pacific Northwest have resulted in higher prices for lumber and wood chips. Construction and real estate activity continue healthy in most parts of the District, with some cooling noted in California, while the market is heating up in the Seattle area. Western bankers report strong loan demand, but slow deposit growth and stiff competition for deposits.
Auto sales continue weak in most parts of the District, as rebate programs have not yet reduced excessive inventories to acceptable levels. One banker notes that many customers attracted by the discount programs cannot obtain financing due to their poor credit histories.
Wage trends in the trade and service industries are mixed. Retailers report some wage pressures, particularly at the low end, although one notes that these pressures are "manageable." A transportation services firm recently negotiated a new four-year contract that includes annual wage hikes of only 3 percent. However, wage pressures are intense in the health services. Nurses in several parts of the District are seeking double-digit wage increases in their new contracts, and strikes have begun at some hospitals.
Some softness in orders for electronic components is reported. One manufacturer reports that his sales grew by 15 to 25 percent in each of the past three years, but growth currently is running at only a 3 percent pace.
Limited log supplies have boosted the prices of Northwest lumber products dramatically in recent months, despite reduced lumber demand. The price of a Northwest two-by-four rose 14 percent between the second quarter of 1988 and the second quarter of 1989. The reduced supply of timber also has doubled the price of wood chips, a key input to pulp and paper manufacturing.
At the same time, Seattle's real estate market has taken off, with reports of double-digit annual price increases. Construction activity also is booming, and some contractors are so busy that they are declining opportunities to bid for new work.
