Deposit inflows at district savings and loan institutions are slightly higher than a month ago but lower than a year ago. However, deposit inflows vary substantially from one institution to another. Some respondents attribute the recent behavior of deposit flows to uncertainty about the new savings and loan legislation. Although mortgage demand has been mixed, modest growth is expected in the near future. Nearly all respondents report slightly lower mortgage rates, but most expect stable rates in coming months.
The district corn, soybean, and milo crops are generally in good condition. Across most of the district, recent rainfall has improved crop growing conditions, and good yields are likely if further timely rainfall is received. But in some areas, where planting was delayed last spring, crops could be threatened by an early frost.
Little expansion in district cattle and hog numbers is expected this year. District fed cattle prices remain strong, but cattle feeding margins are being squeezed by the high price of feeder cattle. High feeder cattle prices, in turn, are contributing to large profit margins for cattle ranchers. Although such profits would typically result in an expansion of cattle herds, drought-diminished feed supplies are likely to restrict herd expansion this year. Slaughter hog prices are higher, but little expansion in hog-feeding activity is likely because feeding margins remain near break-even levels.
