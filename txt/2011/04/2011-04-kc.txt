The District economy expanded solidly in late February and March. Consumer   spending rebounded in March after severe weather limited February sales. Factory   production rose sharply, allowing manufacturers to rebuild inventories and   fulfill a surge in new orders. Residential construction remained weak, and   commercial construction rose modestly. Strong commodity prices boosted profits   at energy and agricultural enterprises. District bankers reported weaker loan   demand, higher deposits and improvements in loan quality. Despite tighter labor   markets, especially for skilled workers, District contacts did not expect to   raise wages in order to hire new workers. More manufacturers and distributors   expected to pass through higher raw material and fuel costs to finished goods   prices, and more retailers expected to raise selling prices in the coming   months.
