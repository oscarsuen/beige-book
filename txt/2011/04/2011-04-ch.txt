Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to increase in February   and March. However, contacts' optimism was tempered by elevated uncertainty   surrounding recent global events. Consumer and business spending increased.   Manufacturing production expanded, though construction was again subdued. Credit   conditions continued to improve. There was some further pass-through of higher   commodity prices to downstream prices. Expectations were for more corn and fewer   soybean acres to be planted in the District this spring relative to last   year.
