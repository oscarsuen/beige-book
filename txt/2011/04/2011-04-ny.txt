The Second District's economy has strengthened further since the last report.   Firms in various industries report widespread increases in input prices and some   increases in selling prices, while retail prices are generally reported to be   stable. Labor market conditions improved moderately, with increased hiring   reported in a number of industries. Retail sales were robust in February and   March, with particular strength in auto sales. Consumer confidence has been   mixed but generally steady since the last report. Tourism activity rebounded   somewhat in March, after weakening modestly in February. Commercial real estate   markets have been mixed. Housing markets have been generally stable, with   relative strength at the lower end of the market. Finally, bankers report some   weakening in household loan demand, and a moderate increase in delinquencies on   commercial and industrial loans.
Retailers generally report strong   results for February and March. One major retail chain notes that sales were   ahead of plan in February and March, while another describes sales as on plan.   Two major malls in western New York State also characterize sales as steady and   strong, continuing to be buoyed by a flow of Canadian shoppers. A number of   retail contacts note that, due to the later Easter this year, sales were   modestly lower in March than a year earlier, but this effect is expected to be   reversed in April. Unseasonably cool weather was not considered a major factor.   Two major retail chains note that New York City under-performed the rest of the   region in terms of sales growth last month. Inventories are generally reported   to be at desired levels, and prices are reported to be stable, though one large   retailer notes that it is testing out price increases on certain lines of   merchandise.
Auto dealers in upstate New York--metropolitan Rochester and   Buffalo--characterize sales of new vehicles as exceptionally strong since the   last report. Sales of used cars were also relatively robust, and dealers report   that business at service departments remains brisk. Retail credit conditions   continued to improve.
Confidence surveys have given mixed results since the last report. Siena   College's survey of New York State residents shows consumer confidence among NY   State residents leveling off in March, after falling in February. The Conference   Board reports that residents of the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, Pa) became   considerably less confident about the near-term outlook, in March, but that   their assessment of current conditions improved for the 4th straight month.
Tourism activity in New York City picked up again in March, after slowing   somewhat in February. Occupancy rates at Manhattan hotels moved up noticeably in   March, and the number of occupied rooms was up modestly from a year earlier.   Hotel revenues, which had slipped below comparable 2010 levels in February,   rebounded in March. Attendance and revenues at Broadway theaters also slipped in   February but rebounded above year-earlier levels in March.
Housing markets across the   District have been generally stable since the last report, with the lower end of   the market generally performing a bit better than the higher end, and re-sales   performing better than new home sales. An authority on New Jersey's housing   industry reports that market conditions remain weak: despite some uptick in   resale transactions, the spring season, thus far, has been unusually slow.   Brokers report that there have been more all-cash deals but also more distress   sales. Sales and construction of new homes remain at exceptionally weak levels.   A Buffalo-area real estate contact reports that selling prices have increased   modestly from a year ago, but that sales activity has been mixed--brisk at the   lower end of the market, with some sellers receiving multiple offers, but   sluggish at the middle and upper ends of the market.
Activity in New York City's co-op and condo market was generally stable in   the first quarter, though the high end of the market has slowed a bit. While   total activity was relatively flat versus a year ago, co-op sales rose sharply,   while condo sales fell sharply. New condo units represent a smaller proportion   of total apartment sales than they have in recent years. Overall, listing   inventory is down roughly 5 percent from a year ago. Prices are steady in   Manhattan, but continue to drift down in the other boroughs. Manhattan's   apartment rental market has picked up somewhat since the last report. Overall,   rents were reported to be little changed in March, but rents on smaller (studio)   apartments continued to climb and were up more than 10 percent from a year ago.   Vacancy rates declined, after edging up in January and February, and the   inventory of available units is described as tight.
Office markets have been mixed but generally steady across the District in   the first quarter of 2011. The office vacancy rate rose moderately in Manhattan   and Long Island (where it reached a multi-year high), but was little changed in   Northern NJ. However, asking rents in all these areas moved up, and landlords   reportedly scaled back on concessions. In the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse   areas, vacancy rates edged down, while asking rents were steady to up   moderately. In Westchester and Fairfield counties and metropolitan Albany,   however, office markets showed further signs of softening, as vacancy rates rose   and asking rents continued to decline modestly.
Reports from business contacts   suggest some broad-based improvement in the labor market. A major New York City   employment agency reports a marked pickup in hiring activity in March and   describes it as the best month in a number of years. The pickup has been most   notable in financial and legal services but also in other areas, such as public   relations and real estate. On the supply side, this contact notes that there are   fewer candidates looking, and that more employed people are making moves. More   generally, firms in both manufacturing and other sectors report a further pickup   in both hiring activity and general business conditions in early March, and   contacts remain optimistic about the near term outlook. A trucking-industry   contact reports that shipping activity has picked up steadily in recent months,   but that firms face rising costs from both rising energy prices and more   stringent federal regulations. More broadly, firms in various industries report   increasingly widespread increases in input prices, and some increase in selling   prices.
Bankers report decreased demand   for consumer loans and residential mortgages, increased demand for commercial   mortgages and no change in demand for commercial and industrial loans. The   decrease was most prevalent for residential mortgages. Bankers indicate steady   demand for refinancing. Respondents report no change in credit standards for   consumer loans and a tightening of credit standards for the other loan   categories. No banker reported an easing of credit standards in any category.   Bankers report a decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for   residential mortgages but no change in spreads in the other loan categories.   Respondents also note a decrease in the average deposit rate. Bankers report an   uptick in delinquency rates for commercial and industrial loans but no change in   delinquency rates for the other loan categories.
