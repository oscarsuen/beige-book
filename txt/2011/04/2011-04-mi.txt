The Ninth District economy expanded moderately since the last report.   Increased activity was noted in consumer spending, tourism, commercial   construction and real estate, manufacturing, energy and mining, and agriculture.   The services sector was mixed, and residential construction and real estate   activity decreased. Labor markets continued to show signs of strengthening,   while wage increases remained subdued. Retail price increases were modest, but   price pressures for inputs continued. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending   increased. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in   February were up almost 2 percent compared with a year earlier. A mall manager   in North Dakota reported that recent sales were up slightly from a year ago. A   representative of a retailers association expects restaurant growth during 2011   in Sioux Falls, S.D. However, retailers noted that March sales may finish lower   than March 2010 sales due to the late Easter holiday. A representative of a Montana auto dealers association reported improving   sales; gas prices were not yet a factor in buying decisions. Recent North Dakota   vehicle sales were healthy, and dealers were optimistic about 2011, according to   an auto dealers association. A domestic auto dealer in Minnesota said that March   sales were "excellent." Late-winter tourism activity was up from a year ago. A chamber of commerce   representative reported that late-winter snowmobiling and cross country skiing   were strong in northwestern Wisconsin. A Minnesota ski resort noted that   February and March activity was up about 8 percent from last year. Several   Montana ski areas extended their seasons due to deep snowpack. Construction and Real Estate Commercial construction   activity increased slightly. March industrial and office permits increased in   value in Sioux Falls, from a year earlier, but other commercial permits   decreased; a large hotel is under construction in the city's downtown.   Commercial contractors in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area said activity increased   recently, particularly for industrial and medical facilities. Residential   construction decreased for the most part. The value of March residential permits   in Minneapolis-St. Paul fell 52 percent from a year earlier; in Sioux Falls they   fell 26 percent. However, an unanticipated increase in multifamily construction   was noted, with several multifamily projects under way in Sioux Falls and   Minneapolis. Commercial real estate markets improved slightly. Office and industrial   vacancy rates fell in Fargo, N.D., according to a commercial developer there. In   Minneapolis-St. Paul, a commercial real estate firm noted that vacancy for   high-quality office space went down, but demand for lower-quality office space   remained weak; retail, hotel and industrial vacancies are expected to decrease   slightly from currently high levels. Residential real estate was slow. Home   sales in late March in Minneapolis-St. Paul were almost 17 percent below   year-earlier levels; median sales prices fell, and inventories increased   slightly. A real estate broker in Fargo said the market there was stable. In   contrast, the market for rental housing in Minneapolis-St. Paul picked up.   Interest in vacation homes in northern Minnesota has increased, according to a   contact there. Services Professional business services firms reported   mixed demand since the last report. A web development consulting firm noted   increased demand for online marketing services. A logistics consulting company   noted an increase in demand due to companies adjusting to the disruptions caused   by the disaster in Japan. However, a contact from a mortgage servicer noted   reduced refinancing activity. Manufacturing Manufacturing output was up since the last   report. An April survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha,   Neb.) showed increases in manufacturing activity in Minnesota, South Dakota, and   North Dakota. A consulting firm recently released a survey of 400 Minnesota   manufacturing companies, which indicated that 51 percent expect increased sales   in 2011 compared with 2010. A tractor maker is expanding into a Minnesota   facility. A circuit board producer plans to expand in South Dakota. However, in   North Dakota, an electronic components plant plans to close. Surprisingly, 41   percent of manufacturing respondents to a late March ad hoc survey by the   Minneapolis Fed indicated they were somewhat unfavorably impacted by the   disaster in Japan. One contact noted that plastic resin shipments from Japan   have been delayed. Energy and Mining Activity in the energy and mining   sectors increased since the last report. Late-March oil exploration activity   increased from mid-February. Construction of a $140 million geothermal energy   project was approved at a Montana mine site. Iron ore mines in northern   Minnesota were operating at full capacity, with expectations that 2011   production will be the highest in more than 10 years. Montana mines were   operating at near capacity. Agriculture District agricultural producers continued to   enjoy strong conditions, in spite of wet weather and spring flooding. Prices for   most District agricultural commodities increased since the last report,   including wheat, cattle, hogs, poultry, and dairy products. District farmers are   expected to increase plantings of wheat and corn in 2011, while plantings of   soybeans are expected to decrease slightly. However, some farmers have delayed   plantings due to the wet conditions. Employment, Wages, and Prices Labor markets continued to   show signs of strengthening. In Minnesota, a data storage company recently noted   that it might hire as many as 300 workers this year, and a power generation   company expects to hire 90 employees. A manager at a South Dakota mall noticed   more job openings than usual. According to a survey by an employment services   firm, 13 percent of respondents in Minneapolis-St. Paul expect to increase   staffing levels during the second quarter, while 6 percent expect to decrease   staff. Minnesota initial claims for unemployment insurance were down 22 percent   compared with a year ago. In contrast, a Minnesota-based medical device company   reported plans to cut as many as 2,000 workers companywide, and a   Minnesota-based computer manufacturer will lay off 600 to 900 workers   companywide. Wage increases remained subdued. Manufacturing wages in District states were   up slightly in February compared with a year earlier. Retail price increases were modest, but price pressures for inputs continued.   According to the Minneapolis Fed's ad hoc survey, 25 percent of respondents   increased prices for their final goods and services during the past six weeks,   while 53 percent noted increased input prices. Minnesota gasoline prices at the   end of March were about the same as in mid-February, but were 75 cents per   gallon higher than a year ago. While a number of metals prices remained well   above year-ago levels, some prices decreased slightly since the last report. In   Minnesota, a chamber of commerce representative noted that a surprising number   of businesses took advantage of lower commodity prices last year to negotiate   deals that provided at least short-run protection.
