Economic activity in the Fourth District increased slowly during the past six   weeks. Manufacturers reported stable production but a small decline in new   orders and backlogs. Energy companies noted little change in output. Freight   transport volume trended slightly higher. Retail sales rose slightly, whereas   new-car purchases were reported as mixed. Home builders are increasingly turning   to multi-family development as a revenue source, and nonresidential contractors   struggled to rebuild their backlogs. The demand for business credit continued to   slowly improve, while consumer loan demand was generally weak.
The pace of hiring seen earlier in the third quarter has diminished,   especially in the manufacturing and energy sectors. Staffing-firm   representatives reported a drop-off in the number of new job openings, with   vacancies concentrated in technical occupations and healthcare. Wage pressures   are contained. Prices for materials used by manufacturers and building   contractors were fairly stable or fell slightly.
Production at District factories during the   past six weeks was mainly stable along seasonal trends, with minor declines in   new orders and backlogs. Compared to year-ago levels, output was moderately   higher. Most of our contacts expect near-term weakening in demand, but not to   levels seen in the last recession. Steel producers and service centers reported   that shipping volume was flat or somewhat higher. Shipments are being driven by   transportation, energy, and industrial-equipment-related industries. Steel reps   are cautious in their outlook but remain hopeful that current volume can be   maintained. District auto production rose significantly in August on a   month-over-month basis due to production starts on the 2012 models and the   abatement of supply disruptions from Japan. Year-over-year output also rose, but   the increase was limited to domestic nameplates.
Manufacturers remain committed to their capital spending plans for 2011;   however, a few of our contacts indicated that they are considering pulling back   on spending for 2012. Capacity utilization remains below normal at most   factories, while steel executives reported that their utilization rates were at   or near normal levels. Inventories are in line with sales. Reports on raw   materials show that prices were stable or declined slightly. Nonetheless,   several manufacturers announced modest price increases that will go into effect   early in the fourth quarter. Expectations for rising steel prices were   short-lived. Hiring has diminished since our last report. Manufacturers who have   added to payrolls reported that it was difficult to recruit highly skilled   workers. Wage pressures are contained.
Single-family home construction remains at a   low level; however, several builders noted a recent pick up in traffic and   inquiries. Sales contracts were evenly distributed across price-point   categories. Half of our contacts reported that constructing and managing   multi-family developments now accounts for most of their work. One contractor   remarked that his business has shifted to renovating foreclosed houses and   renting them. A few builders reported that they would like to increase their   spec inventory, but it remains difficult to obtain financing. Expectations call   for little change in residential building in the near term. Not much difference   was seen in the list prices or discounting of new homes since our last report,   while building material prices showed normal fluctuations. We heard comments   about subcontractors attempting to raise their prices to cover rising costs, but   these attempts were mainly unsuccessful. General contractors added slightly to   their payrolls. Any increases in take-home pay are being offset by substantial   increases in health insurance premiums.
Activity in nonresidential construction for small to medium-size builders   remained fairly weak, with much of their work limited to expansions and   lower-budget projects. However, the number of inquiries has picked up slightly   since our last report. The biggest challenge facing builders at this time is   adding backlog. Construction contracts were primarily with health care providers   and manufacturers, while a decline was seen in government-funded projects.   Looking forward, our contacts expect modest growth at best during the next six   months. Building material prices held steady. One builder mentioned that his   firm recently purchased construction equipment for the first time since 2007.   Construction payrolls and wages were stable.
Retailers described their sales for the   period from mid-August through late September as slightly higher than during the   previous six weeks. On a year-over-year basis, transactions also improved,   mainly in the low single digits. Many of our contacts reported that customers   were particularly interested in items that are new and innovative. Looking ahead   to the fourth quarter, retailers expect sales to rise in the low- to mid-single   digits on a year-over-year basis; however, grocers anticipate little change. We   continued to hear about some upward pressure on supplier prices, although it   mainly affects food products and items manufactured from cotton. In response,   retailers were selective about the amount of the price pressures they passed   through to consumers. Reports on profit margins were mixed. Capital budgets   remain as planned. Half of our contacts said that outlays are higher than a year   ago, and that they are used mainly for remodeling, constructing new stores, and   e-commerce infrastructure. Little change in payrolls is expected at existing   stores.
Reports on new-vehicle sales from mid-August through late September were   mixed. On a year-over-year basis, vehicle purchases improved for most of our   contacts, with several noting double-digit increases. Demand for fuel-efficient,   less-expensive cars continued to grow, although the market for crossover   vehicles remains fairly strong. Inventories are rebuilding, especially for   Japanese cars, but remain below what many dealers would like. Dealers are   cautious in their outlook due to uncertainty about the economy and the   availability of vehicles that consumers want to buy. Demand for used cars is   steady but down slightly from earlier in the year. We heard a few reports of   some easing in credit restrictions, while banks and credit unions continued to   price loans very competitively. Many dealers are in the process of initiating   factory-mandated programs for showroom upgrades and reimaging. The pickup in   dealer hiring that we saw a couple of months ago has diminished. The few dealers   who are looking to hire report that it is difficult to find qualified   candidates.
Demand for business loans showed a moderate   improvement, with requests being driven mainly by commercial real estate,   manufacturing, and healthcare. Reports indicated downward pressure on interest   rates for commercial credit. On the consumer side, bankers reported that   applications for home equity lines of credit have declined, and they   characterized installment loan activity as flat or down. However, direct and   indirect auto lending continued to show strength. Applications for refinancing   residential mortgages have picked up due to lower interest rates, with little   activity in new purchases. No changes were made to loan application standards.   Since our last report, many of our contacts have experienced substantial growth   in core deposits from consumers and businesses. Delinquencies were mainly steady   or declined across loan categories. Payrolls were stable, with only very   selective hiring expected for the remainder of the year.
Conventional oil and natural gas drilling and   production were fairly stable during the past six weeks, while activity in   Marcellus and Utica shales expanded. A few producers expect output from   conventional wells to increase in the upcoming months. Wellhead prices paid to   independent producers remain on a downward trend. Little change in coal output   is anticipated for the remainder of this year and into 2012. Spot prices for   coal increased slightly. Capital outlays are on target, with moderate increases   projected by oil and gas companies in the upcoming months for drilling new   wells. The cost of production equipment and materials was flat during the past   six weeks. Energy payrolls held steady.
Overall, freight transport volume   continued on a slight upward trend, with increases seen in consumer products,   including furniture. Most of our contacts expect volume to grow at a slow,   steady pace in the near term. Although diesel fuel prices have moderated, a few   contacts noted that their companies still have a fuel surcharge in place. Truck   maintenance costs continued to rise. Two of our respondents have successfully   increased their shipping rates as customer contracts came up for renewal.   Capital outlays have accelerated during 2011 relative to prior-year levels.   Spending is mainly to replace aging equipment and to support demand growth from   energy customers. One executive noted that newer engines and class 8 trucks are   increasing in price, and that it is becoming more difficult to secure financing.   Hiring has been largely for driver replacement; however, we heard a couple of   reports about carriers adding capacity. Wage pressures are emerging due to a   tightening of the driver pool.
