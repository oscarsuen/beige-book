The Tenth District economy improved slightly in late August and September.   Retailers and auto dealers reported stronger sales and anticipated further gains   in the months ahead. Sales were weaker at restaurants and hotels, leading to   pessimism in these industries as the holiday season approaches. Manufacturing   activity rose at durable goods factories, and the high-tech services industry   experienced strong growth, while transportation activity was flat. Residential   and commercial real estate and construction contacts continued to report weak   conditions. Bank deposits continued to increase, while loan demand and loan   quality deteriorated slightly. Crop conditions varied across the District, but   farm income expectations remained strong. The energy sector expanded further   with production increasing for oil, natural gas and coal. As input prices   continued to increase, more contacts expected to raise prices in the coming   months. But wage pressures eased from already low levels.
