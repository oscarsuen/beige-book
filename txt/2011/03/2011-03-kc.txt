The Tenth District economy expanded further in January and early February,   though inclement weather dampened consumer spending. Retailers reported that   severe winter storms contributed to limited sales but they expected a rebound in   coming months. District manufacturers reported solid growth since the previous   survey period and anticipated strong future activity. Little improvement was   noted in residential real estate; however, commercial real estate showed further   signs of stabilization. District banks reported a decrease in overall loan   demand, increased deposits, and stable loan quality. In agriculture, poor   growing conditions and tight supplies raised commodity prices. Hiring and   production expanded in the energy sector along with drilling activity in key oil   and gas liquids fields in the District. Retailers and manufacturers noted added   pressure on profit margins from increased materials costs. There was little   evidence of wage pressures across District labor markets.
