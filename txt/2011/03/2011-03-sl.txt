The economy of the Eighth District has expanded modestly since our previous   report. Manufacturing activity decreased, while activity in the services sector   continued to increase. Retail and auto sales in January and early February   increased over year-earlier levels. Home sales continued to decline across the   District, and commercial real estate conditions remained slow. Overall lending   at a sample of large District banks saw little change during the fourth quarter   of 2010.
Car dealers in the District reported that sales in January and early February   were up, on average, compared with last year's sales. About 71 percent of the   car dealers surveyed saw increases in sales, while 12 percent saw decreases and   17 percent saw no changes. One-third of the car dealers noted that used car   sales had increased relative to new car sales, while 5 percent reported the   opposite. Also, about 30 percent of contacts reported an increase in sales of   low-end vehicles relative to high-end vehicles, while less than 5 percent   reported the opposite. About 46 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported   that their inventories were at desired levels, while 25 percent reported that   their inventories were too high. The sales outlook among the car dealers for   March and April was generally optimistic. Almost 92 percent of the car dealers   expect sales to increase over 2010 levels.
The District's services sector continued to improve since our previous   report. Contacts in the legal services, commercial printing, entertainment,   support activities for air transportation, and business support services   industries reported plans to expand existing operations in the District and hire   new employees. In contrast, contacts in government services and religious   organizations announced plans to decrease operations and lay off workers.
