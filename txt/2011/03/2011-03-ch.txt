Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to increase in January   and February, though at a pace not quite as strong as during the previous   reporting period. Nonetheless, contacts' expectations for growth in 2011   improved. Consumer spending increased at a slower pace, while the pace of   business spending was steady. Manufacturing production expanded at a more   moderate pace, and construction was again subdued. Credit conditions continued   to improve. There was some pass-through of higher commodity prices to downstream   prices, and District farmers continued to benefit from higher prices for   agricultural commodities.
Consumer spending increased in January   and early February, but at a slower pace than during the previous reporting   period. Promotions and sales continued to drive spending, but retailers also   noted signs of improving consumer demand, including an increase in sales of   luxury goods such as jewelry. Sales of some big-ticket items like electronics   and appliances also improved after weaker than expected holiday sales. The pace   of auto sales held steady at a relatively high level. Dealers remained   optimistic pointing to pent-up demand in some market segments, improvement in   the availability of auto financing even for lower quality borrowers, and   increases in demand for new and luxury vehicles.
Business spending continued at a steady   pace. Contacts reported some additional strength in demand for equipment coming   from agriculture and the energy industry. Spending on structures was more   limited, but contacts also expected it to increase slightly over the course of   the year. Inventories were little changed, although some manufacturers and   agribusinesses were increasing stocks in anticipation of higher commodity   prices. Retailers indicated that inventories remain in a comfortable range given   the current pace of sales. Hiring picked up some. Manufacturers continued to add   to payrolls, but again cited difficulty in filling certain skilled positions.   Retailers also noted plans to increase hiring. A large staffing firm reported   solid growth in billable hours for both industrial and office and clerical   positions. They also noted that both temporary-to-permanent job transitions and   direct hiring of permanent employees inched up further.
Construction activity was   again subdued. However, contacts anticipated an uptick in residential   construction in 2011, particularly for multi-family properties where apartment   builders were receiving financing and development contracts for new   construction. In addition, single-family home construction, especially in   uncompleted existing subdivisions, was also expected to begin to slowly   increase. Activity in the residential real estate market was up slightly, and   the pace of foreclosures slowed. Home prices were little changed, while   residential rents were reported to be rising. Private nonresidential   construction was flat, but builders noted a slight pick-up in activity for both   office and industrial properties. Commercial real estate conditions continued to   slowly improve. Contacts indicated that vacancy rates were flattening out, but   some downward pressure on commercial rents remained.
Manufacturing production expanded at a more   moderate pace in January and early February. Orders, however, continued to be   strong, and backlogs were noted to be rising. Several contacts also indicated   that suppliers were facing challenges in keeping up with demand, particularly   for industrial metals and heavy machinery. The steel, automotive, and heavy   equipment industries continued to be sources of strength. A contact reported   that active capacity in the steel industry was nearly fully utilized, but   steelmakers remained cautious about bringing back on line currently idle   capacity. Manufacturers of fabricated metals also reported strength in   production and new orders. An automaker noted that sales had been better than   expected in January, and an increase in production plans for the first half of   the year may be needed as inventories remain lean. Demand for heavy machinery   and trucks increased, with rental companies adding to fleets and end-user demand   also on the rise. A building supplies manufacturer indicated that shipments   currently were down, but that they expected an increase in shipments this year   for the first time since 2005. A contact in the home appliance industry also   reported lower shipments in January, but expected a bounce back in February.
Credit conditions continued to   improve in January and early February. With market interest rates rising,   financing costs increased, but corporate credit spreads for a number of large   firms in the District were slightly improved. Competition for commercial and   industrial loans continued to be fierce, and contacts noted an increased   presence of large banks in small business lending. Demand for business and   consumer credit increased. Much of this continued to be refinancing of existing   debt, but core loan demand was noted to be slowly rising. Credit line   utilization also picked up, as working capital needs increased. While   delinquencies remained elevated, loan quality continued to improve, albeit at a   slower pace than during the previous reporting period. Several contacts noted   that the banking sector seems to be on its way toward balance sheet repair with   earnings improving, and may be starting to turn the corner on lending. Credit   availability is beginning to improve for most loan types, although the bulk of   lending is still going to the most high quality borrowers.
Cost pressures increased in January and   early February. Manufacturing contacts noted that increases in prices for   industrial metals, such as copper and steel, and other raw materials were   beginning to be passed on to customers. Prices for agricultural commodities like   corn, wheat, dairy, hogs and cattle also moved higher, as did most energy costs,   although ample supply continued to hold the price of natural gas at historically   low levels. Contacts cited a combination of strong global demand, particularly   from Asian markets, and tight supplies as factors behind the recent rise in   commodity prices. Retailers reported higher wholesale prices, and expected that   some pass-through would be necessary this year to avoid further squeezing   margins. The construction industry, however, continued to experience downward   pressure on prices despite higher raw material costs. Contacts also noted higher   costs from increases in state corporate taxes and unemployment insurance, while   wage pressures remained moderate.
Last fall's harvest ended up being smaller   than previously estimated. Moreover, stocks of corn were lower than predicted.   Input costs for crop production moved up over the winter. District crop farmers   were, however, in a strong financial position, as most of the fall harvest had   been sold at high prices. Corn and wheat prices increased during the reporting   period, while soybean prices changed little. More acres of corn are expected to   be planted this year than last. Farmers reportedly also planned to expand acres   under tillage a bit by clearing fence rows and wooded acres. Margins for dairy   and livestock producers strengthened as dairy, hog, and cattle prices rose more   than feed costs did.
