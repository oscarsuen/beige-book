The Fifth District continued to experience modest improvement across most   sectors since our last report. Manufacturing activity picked up some momentum,   bolstered by solid shipments and orders. Our non-retail services indexes   improved, albeit at a slightly slower pace than earlier. The tourist industry   enjoyed increased bookings. Bankers reported rising loan demand along with   improved credit quality. Both residential and commercial real estate contacts   noted some gains from still-weak levels. In contrast to these positive reports,   the agricultural sector was held back by adverse weather and the retail sector   experienced softer sales. District employment improved somewhat. Prices were up   only moderately from our last report. Commodity prices, however, moved   significantly higher. While most sellers were not passing through cost increases   yet, many expected to begin raising prices later this year.
Commercial real estate experienced broad-based, but moderate improvement   across the District over the last six weeks. Many contacts cited an uptick in   activity leading to the closing of office, industrial, and retail deals. A   Realtor in central Virginia stated that the increase in demand for suburban   office space had real depth for the first time in years, although downtown   demand remained weak. Several real estate management firms reported a growing   demand for warehouse space. A Realtor on the Atlantic Coast noted that national   retailers were expressing renewed interest in expanding space (and even hiring).   And, a developer in West Virginia noted that further weakening of the local   economy was holding back the local market, but conditions had not deteriorated   in recent months. Prices of properties and leasing rates generally remained   unchanged, according to contacts, due to continuing high vacancy rates.
