Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand slowly in June   and early July. Contacts expressed heightened uncertainty about the economic   outlook given recent weaker-than-expected demand as well as the ongoing fiscal   issues in the U.S. and Europe. Consumer and business spending edged up.   Manufacturing production continued to expand at a steady pace while construction   remained flat. Credit conditions again improved modestly, despite increased   volatility in financial markets. Commodity prices remained elevated, and there   was further pass-through of these costs to prices downstream. After a late start   to planting, crop conditions began to return to normal, but dryness and   above-average temperatures were concerns for farmers in parts of the   District.
