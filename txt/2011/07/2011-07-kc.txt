The Tenth District economy expanded at a moderate pace in the June and early   July survey period. Consumer spending rose solidly and was especially strong   among restaurants and auto dealers. Factory production rebounded from weakness   in the prior survey period, and high-tech and transportation services firms   reported continued growth. District bankers reported weaker loan demand but   increased deposits and improved loan quality. Weak home sales and expanded   inventory levels further pressured single-family home prices, while commercial   real estate activity remained slow but stable. Activity in the energy sector was   robust as drilling expanded in most District states. Conditions in agriculture   were generally strong. Rising input costs were reported in several sectors, but   wage pressures were limited to select industries and occupations.
