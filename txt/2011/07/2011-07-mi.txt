The Ninth District economy grew modestly, but activity was disrupted by   widespread flooding and a temporary Minnesota state government shutdown that   started on July 1. Increased activity was noted in consumer spending,   residential construction, commercial and residential real estate, services,   manufacturing, energy and mining. Mixed activity was noted in tourism and   agriculture, while commercial construction was steady. Private sector hiring   grew modestly, and wage increases continued to be moderate. Overall price   increases were moderate, although pressure remains on a number of input   prices.
Consumer spending posted   measured growth. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store   sales in June increased over 4 percent compared with a year earlier. Two   Minneapolis area malls noted that recent sales were trending above year-ago   levels. A representative of an auto dealers association in Montana indicated   that sales activity at dealerships during the past few months increased over   last year. A Minnesota auto dealer noted that sales and service volumes were up   from last year.
Summer tourism activity was mixed. In western South Dakota, wet weather   dampened the start to the season, but summer reservations for RV camping were up   about 2 percent. A travel agency in Minnesota noted that both corporate and   leisure business were up from a year ago. However, Minnesota state parks were   closed during the government shutdown. Flooding in North Dakota has slowed   tourism activity, including cancelation of this summer's state fair in   Minot.
Several contacts from across   the District reported that recent commercial construction activity was steady at   low levels, while construction had stalled in flooded areas. A nutritional   supplement producer is building a major addition in Montana. However,   construction in the Minnesota transportation sector stalled during the state   government shutdown. Some private nonresidential construction was delayed by   lack of state government building inspectors. Residential construction increased   from last year. The value of residential building permits in June increased 19   percent from the same period a year earlier in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area; in   Minneapolis-St. Paul, the value of June permits increased significantly from a   year ago.
Commercial real estate markets increased slightly since the last report.   Minnesota commercial real estate industry representatives expect higher rents   and lower vacancy rates, according to a May survey by the University of St.   Thomas. Retail real estate industry analysts expect a slight increase in   absorption, but decreases in rent over the summer in the Minneapolis-St. Paul   area. Residential real estate markets grew. Home sales during June in   Minneapolis-St. Paul and Billings, Mont., were up from last year's   post-tax-credit lull in sales. June pending sales of homes in the Sioux Falls   area increased from June 2010, but new listings and the median sales price   decreased.
Professional business services firms reported   increased activity over the past three months. Results of a mid-July Minneapolis   Fed ad hoc survey of 55 professional services firms indicated that 47 percent of   the respondents saw increased sales, while 29 percent saw decreased sales.   Respondents noted that profits and employment also increased. The respondents   expected this trend to continue over the next three months. However, a few   contacts commented that the Minnesota state government shutdown negatively   affected their business.
The manufacturing sector grew modestly. A   survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) showed that   manufacturing activity increased in June in Minnesota and South Dakota, while   activity declined in North Dakota, due in part to flooding disruptions. Nearly   70 percent of manufacturing respondents to the Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey   said their sales increased in the past three months. However, in North Dakota,   an electric vehicle plant closed in June to consolidate production in Iowa, and   a military equipment plant will close in August.
Activity in the energy and mining   sectors was steady. A renewable energy firm recently announced that it will   acquire a biodiesel plant in southern Minnesota, which has been idle since 2008,   and resume operations there. Wind-energy development projects continued since   the last report, including the opening of a 40-megawatt wind farm in Minnesota.   However, a utility announced that it was canceling plans for a $38 million wind   farm in western South Dakota. Mid-July oil exploration activity decreased   slightly from early June. Mining activity continued at a strong pace across the   District.
Agriculture was mixed. While production in   western portions of the District was hampered by severe flooding, prices for   agricultural outputs remained strong. Preliminary estimates suggest that 6.3   million acres in North Dakota may have gone unplanted due to flooding. Contacts   suggested that impacts on hay and feed crops could increase costs for some   cattle producers, but a bank director noted that overall hay production in   Montana and the Dakotas will be very strong due to moisture conditions. In other   parts of the District, crop progress has fared better recently than early-season   indicators suggested, but is still behind last year's pace. Prices for some   District agricultural commodities increased since the last report, including   corn, soybeans and dairy products; however, cattle and wheat prices decreased   recently.
While private sector hiring   grew modestly, the Minnesota government shutdown resulted in 22,000 temporary   layoffs of state government employees. In Minnesota, a company recently   announced plans to build a data center that is expected to provide more than 100   jobs, and a steel producer will add 60 jobs this year. According to a survey by   an employment services firm, 20 percent of respondents in Minneapolis-St. Paul   expect to increase staffing levels during the third quarter, while 3 percent   expect to decrease staff. Businesses in eastern Montana and western North Dakota   continued to have difficulty finding workers due to strong oil drilling activity   in the region.
Wage increases were moderate. Recent settlements with labor unions generally   included modest wage increases over the next two to three years. According to   respondents to a recent St. Cloud (Minn.) Area Business Outlook Survey, 34   percent expect to increase employee compensation at their companies over the   next six months, up from last year's survey, when 24 percent expected   increases.
Overall price increases were moderate, although pressure remains on a number   of input prices. Mid-July Minnesota gasoline prices were about the same as early   June, but were $1 per gallon higher than a year ago. Meanwhile, prices for   copper, lead, nickel and zinc increased. A Minnesota-based food producer   reported that food ingredients are expected to rise at least 10 percent over the   next year.
