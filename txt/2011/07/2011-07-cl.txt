Business activity in the Fourth District continued to expand at a modest   pace, albeit at a slower rate since our last report. Manufacturers reported a   slight rise in production and new orders, while freight transport volume   continued to grow. Retail sales increased, but were below plan for some chains.   New car sales weakened slightly. Energy companies noted little change in output.   New-home construction is sluggish, whereas nonresidential building showed   continued improvement. The demand for business and consumer credit remains   low. Rising payrolls were mainly limited to the manufacturing and energy sectors.   Staffing-firm representatives noted moderate growth in the number of new job   openings, with vacancies concentrated in manufacturing and professional business   services. Wage pressures are largely contained. We heard fewer reports about   rising prices for commodities and other raw materials. In particular, steel   firms noted a leveling off in prices for their products, while food producers   reported a slow decline in some agricultural commodity prices. Manufacturing Reports from District factories indicate   that production was stable or rose slightly during the past six weeks. About   half of our respondents noted a rise in new orders. Many of our contacts expect   some slowing in the third quarter due to seasonal factors, followed by a modest   pick-up later in the year. Almost all steel producers and service centers   reported that shipping volume declined during the second quarter, which they   attributed in part to weakening in the auto sector. Steel representatives   anticipate volume remaining close to current levels through the end of the third   quarter. Shipments are being driven primarily by heavy equipment and   energy-related industries. District auto production showed a moderate rise in   June on a month-over-month basis, as supply disruptions caused by events in   Japan diminished. Year-over-year production fell, but declines were mainly   limited to foreign nameplates. Manufacturers remain committed to raising capital outlays in the upcoming   months relative to year-ago levels. The number of contacts who earlier reported   delaying the start of projects due to slowing in the recovery has declined   considerably. Capacity utilization rates remain below what is considered normal   for a majority of manufacturers. Reports on raw material pricing were mixed, and   only a few of our contacts said that they had passed through price increases.   Steel prices leveled off, while food producers reported a slow decline in some   agricultural commodity prices. In general, manufacturers continued hiring at a   modest pace. Wage pressures are contained. Real Estate New-home construction remains at a low level,   with only two of our contacts reporting an uptick in sales during June.   Purchases were mainly in the move-up buyer categories. Contractors expect that   single-family construction will remain depressed until potential buyers can more   easily sell their existing homes and the job market begins to gain some   traction. List prices of new homes held steady, while the use of discounting   grew. Upward pressure on the cost of building materials was reported by almost   all of our contacts. Spec inventories were reduced further relative to year-ago   levels. General contractors continue to work with lean crews, and no hiring is   expected in the near term. Many subcontractors are struggling to stay in   business and are bidding jobs below cost. Activity in nonresidential construction strengthened somewhat during the past   couple of months, with a few of our contacts noting a significant improvement   when compared to year-ago levels. Inquiries are on the rise, and several   contractors reported growing backlogs, albeit with weak margins. Construction is   taking place in a broad range of industry sectors. Almost all of our contacts   expect that activity will continue to slowly improve as the year progresses.   Financing is available, though underwriting standards remain high. Banks are   unwilling to lend for speculative projects, and they require additional equity   when refinancing an existing property. Most of our contacts reported normal   price fluctuations for building materials. Aggressive pricing on the part of   both general contractors and subcontractors was widespread. Construction   payrolls held steady, and little permanent hiring is expected in the upcoming   months. Consumer Spending Reports from retailers indicate that   sales for the period from mid-May through late June rose in the low to   mid-single digits. However, for a few chains, the rate of growth was lower than   expected. This was attributed mainly to inclement weather. Transactions were   mostly higher relative to year-ago levels. Several of our contacts noted that   rising sales included some higher-priced discretionary items. One retailer said   that her overall sales were up due to elevated gasoline prices. Looking forward,   retailers' expectations for the third quarter were mixed. We continue to hear   about upward pressure on supplier prices, although it mainly affects food- and   fuel-related products. Retailers passed through some of their increases to   consumers. Reports on profit margins were mixed, with declines taken primarily   by grocers. Capital outlays remain on plan and are slightly higher than year-ago   levels. A majority of our contacts reported that they plan to expand the number   of their retail outlets. However, no change in payrolls is expected at existing   stores. Most auto dealers reported that new-vehicle sales from mid-May through late   June were below those recorded during the previous six-week period. On a   year-over-year basis, vehicle purchases increased for almost all of our   contacts. Demand for smaller, fuel-efficient cars continues to grow. However,   with some retrenchment in gasoline prices, consumers are beginning to take a   second look at SUVs and trucks. Inventories were characterized as low by many   dealers, and they believe this may be a major contributor to slower sales.   Dealers are cautious in their outlook due to uncertainty about gas prices, the   economy, and the availability of vehicles that consumers want to buy. Demand for   used cars remains fairly strong; however, scarce inventory is contributing to   rising prices. Credit pricing remains very competitive, and the use of leasing   as a credit alternative is growing. Many dealers are in the process of   initiating factory-mandated programs for showroom upgrades and reimaging. Little   change in dealer payrolls was reported. Banking Demand for business loans was generally soft,   with activity driven by non profits and energy companies. A few of our contacts   noted a pick-up in construction-loan requests for multi-family dwellings. On the   consumer side, indirect auto lending was strong, while draw-downs on home equity   lines of credit tapered off. Other installment loan categories remain weak. Many   of our contacts reported downward pressure on interest rates for business and   consumer credit. Applications for residential mortgages declined since our last   report, with submissions equally distributed between refinancing and new   purchases. Overall core deposits continue to increase, but the rate of growth   has declined. We heard a few reports of easing credit standards for commercial   and industrial loans, especially for attractive credits. The credit quality of   business and consumer applicants was characterized as steady or improving. Most   bankers reported a modest improvement in delinquency rates. No significant   changes in employment levels were reported. However, about half of our   respondents said that they expect selective hiring to occur this year. Energy Reports indicate that oil and natural gas drilling   and production showed little change during the past six weeks, with activity in   Marcellus and Utica shales continuing to grow. Wellhead prices paid to   independent producers have declined. Demand for coal is rising, especially in   overseas markets. However, due to transport issues and increasing governmental   oversight in permitting and environmental compliance, production remained flat.   Little change is anticipated for the remainder of the year. Spot prices for   coal, particularly steam, moved slightly higher. Capital outlays are on target,   with moderate increases projected by oil and gas companies in the upcoming   months. The cost of production equipment and materials increased slightly since   our last report. A modest rise in payrolls by oil and gas producers was   reported. Transportation Freight transport executives told us that   shipping volume expanded slightly, as the effects of supply chain disruptions   due to events in Japan and severe spring weather in the U.S. dissipate.   Expectations call for markets to continue growing at a modest pace in the   upcoming months. The price for diesel fuel remains elevated, with most of the   increase being passed through to customers via surcharges. Capital outlays are   expected to accelerate during 2011. Spending is mainly to replace units that   were in service longer than expected. Hiring has been largely for driver   replacement. However, we heard a couple of reports that carriers are adding   capacity, which remains below pre-recession levels industry-wide. Wage pressures   are emerging due to a tightening of the driver pool.
