The Eleventh District economy expanded at a moderate pace over the past six   weeks. Energy-related activity remained strong. Reports from manufacturers were   mixed but mostly positive, although some construction-related producers were   less optimistic than they were six weeks ago. Nonfinancial services activity   rose, with strong demand for staffing services. The single-family housing sector   remained weak, but the commercial real estate sector continued to improve.   Financial services respondents said overall loan demand was flat during the   reporting period, and contacts in the agricultural sector noted drought   conditions worsened.
Selling prices were flat or higher since the last   report. Most manufacturers said selling prices were stable, while several   service sector companies were able to enact some price increases, including   transportation and retail firms. These price increases were in response to   higher input prices. Accounting, legal and staffing firms reported slight   increases in rates charged for their services. Input prices increased at most   responding firms, although several contacts said upward pressure from higher   energy costs eased in recent weeks as oil prices declined. Transportation firms,   including airlines, noted that the recent price declines for fuel will have a   larger impact on input costs later in July and August. Retailers said cost   pressures were squeezing margins, and food manufacturers said commodity prices   were up significantly from last year.
The price of crude oil fell from over $100 per barrel in early June to about   $95 at the end of the reporting period in early July. Gasoline prices fell about   15 cents during the reporting period. Natural gas prices remained in the $4-$5   per Mcf range, but edged up since the last report because of hot weather. Prices   for most petrochemical products fell since the last report, according to   contacts.
Employment levels held steady at most   responding firms, although there were several reports of hiring. Staffing firms   reported continued strong demand for their services. In addition, there were   some mentions of moderate employment increases from automobile dealers,   transportation service firms and manufacturers of primary and fabricated metals,   transportation equipment, lumber and food. Legal firms noted solid demand for   talented attorneys, and added that start dates for some new hires had been moved   up from January 2012 to fall 2011. In contrast, one construction-related   manufacturer reported a new round of layoffs, and one retail firm was   considering reducing staff levels next year. Wage pressures remained minimal,   although some contacts noted that they were giving modest pay raises.
Reports from construction-related   manufacturers were mixed. Overall, activity levels appeared to be unchanged.   Multifamily activity provided a boost to some firms, although several contacts   said public and government demand had diminished. In particular though,   fabricated metals producers noted a pick-up in growth since the last report due   to infrastructure projects. Construction-related outlooks were generally flat to   slightly up, and contacts believe there will not be much rebound until   residential and commercial construction recover, which may take longer than   previously expected.
Respondents in high-tech manufacturing reported that growth in orders   remained at a moderate pace since the last Beige Book. One respondent with   greater-exposure-than-average to Japanese production said second-quarter sales   were well below pre-earthquake expectations, but that growth in June was strong   enough to finish the quarter slightly above their expectations. Inventories were   at desired levels, although one respondent said that a one-time reduction in   orders from a customer left them with slightly higher-than-desired levels. Most   contacts expect orders and sales growth to remain moderate or to pick up   slightly in the second half of the year.
Reports from paper manufacturers were mixed. Demand for corrugated packaging   improved, but paper suppliers noted flat to slightly slower sales. Manufacturers   of non-defense transportation equipment reported strong sales with demand flat   to slightly up since the last report and well above year-ago levels. Food   producers said sales continued to rise at a steady pace.
Petrochemical producers said demand remained strong for most products.   Contacts said domestic demand has improved, and export markets have re-opened   since the last report. Refinery utilization moved up to near 90 percent, and   contacts in the refining industry said margins narrowed slightly but remained   very strong, although demand for oil products is slightly lower than the same   time last year.
Retailers reported a slight increase in   activity over the reporting period. Compared to a year ago, same store sales are   up in the mid-to-low single digits. Apparel and jewelry are segments that have   performed well recently. Concerns remain regarding the elevated level of   unemployment. Texas sales increased slightly more than the nation on average,   according to one large retailer. The second half of the year should see modest   year-over-year growth. Automobile demand remains strong, but supply constraints   stemming from Japan are limiting sales. Japanese manufacturers are primarily   affected, but inventories of domestic autos are below desired levels as well.   This is expected to last for another 90 days or less before improving through   year-end.
Staffing firms reported continued   strong demand for their services. Temp-to-hire activity has been a bright spot,   with long assignment lengths and several conversions to permanent hires.   Outlooks are cautiously optimistic, with most respondents expecting continued   strength in demand through year-end. Accounting firms noted a seasonal slowdown   in demand for their services. Legal firms reported mostly steady demand, with   continued growth in transactional services.
Intermodal cargo volumes increased since the last report, but year-over-year   volumes are down due to a sharp decline in Asian demand for raw materials.   Contacts in railroad transportation noted a broad-based increase in shipments,   with particularly strong volume growth in metallic and nonmetallic ores and   grains. Container volumes declined during the reporting period, although   contacts said demand has strengthened from a year ago, due to energy-related   activity. Small parcel shipments rebounded in June after declining in May.   Still, outlooks are more pessimistic than previously reported, partly due to   high fuel costs dampening consumer spending. Airlines report some softening in   demand in June compared with May, likely due to an increase in airfares for   last-minute travel. However, passenger volumes are up on a year-over-year basis,   and the outlook for the summer is positive.
Financial firms reported relatively   flat loan demand. National banks reported less pickup in corporate loan demand   following a very active first half of the year, while commercial real estate   (CRE) activity has continued its trend of improvement. Regional banks noted that   loan demand has been mixed, while loan pricing remains aggressive amidst a   highly competitive lending landscape. Outlooks are generally positive in light   of better outstanding loan quality and continued gradual improvement in lending   conditions. Optimism has been tempered by consumer fear regarding economic and   fiscal policy uncertainty as well as the burden and costs associated with the   implementation of new regulations.
Single-family home sales   remain weak, particularly in the lower priced segment of the market. Contacts   say demand is choppy from month to month, but most expect some improvement in   the second half of the year.
Apartment demand remains strong and rents continue to increase. Contacts   noted the Dallas/Fort Worth area topped the national rankings in leasing   activity in the second quarter.
Office and industrial real estate activity   improved since the last report. Contacts say Texas markets are performing better   than the national average overall. One respondent noted office demand was quite   strong in Texas' major metros and that rents were starting to rise. Investment   property sales continued to improve from low levels, and prices rose slightly.
Domestic drilling activity remained strong since   the last report, according to Eleventh District firms in the energy industry.   The rig count continues to shift towards oil-directed drilling, and contacts   noted horizontal drilling and fracturing activity remain very profitable. In the   Gulf of Mexico, 15 rigs have been re-permitted--with seven currently working and   near completion--although a lack of new permits this year has led to some   concerns about the prospects for Gulf work later in the year. International   activity remains strong, but profit margins are thin.
Drought conditions worsened, with about   three-quarters of the district now in the most severe drought classification.   Most Texas counties were designated natural disaster areas in June because they   lost at least 30 percent of crops and pasture to drought. President Obama signed   a disaster declaration in July for 45 counties in Texas that were heavily   impacted by wildfires, which allows federal aid to help with recovery efforts.   Crop conditions continued to deteriorate, causing low yields and complete crop   losses in some instances. Farmers will depend heavily on crop insurance payments   this year. Ranchers continued to cull herds due to very poor grazing conditions,   limited hay supply and costly supplemental feeding.
