Economic activity in the Twelfth District grew modestly during the reporting   period of June through mid-July. Upward price pressures eased overall as the   prices of oil and selected raw materials fell, and upward pressures on wages   remained quite limited on balance. Sales of retail items were mixed, while   demand for business and consumer services rose somewhat. District manufacturing   activity strengthened slightly. Sales continued to grow for agricultural   producers, while mining and extraction activity for natural resources expanded   further. Home sales and construction remained sluggish, and demand for   commercial real estate was weak overall, although continued modest strengthening   was noted for some areas. Contacts from financial institutions reported largely   stable loan demand.
Contacts reported that upward wage pressures were very modest overall,   although some pointed to notable increases in the costs of employee benefits.   Compensation gains in most regions and sectors of the District continued to be   held down by high unemployment and limited hiring activity. However, upward wage   pressures remained pronounced in various sectors for workers with specialized   skills in the application of information technology.
Demand for business and consumer services increased on balance. Sales   continued to expand for providers of technology services, in particular for   digital media services used for Internet-capable mobile devices. By contrast,   demand for transportation services remained largely flat, as did demand for   professional services. Suppliers of energy services reported further growth in   deliveries to households and businesses, although the pace of growth slowed.   Providers of health-care services reported that demand for their services   remained weak. Restaurants and other food-service providers saw demand soften   slightly. However, conditions continued to improve in the travel and tourism   industry, with further demand growth reported in both the business and tourism   segments of the market.
