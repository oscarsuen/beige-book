Economic activity in the Eighth District has continued to increase at a   modest pace since our previous report. Manufacturing activity has continued to   increase since the previous report. Activity in the services sector also has   increased. Residential real estate activity has continued to decline. In   contrast, commercial and industrial activity has improved modestly in some   areas, although commercial construction activity has remained slow. Lending at a   sample of small and mid-sized District banks declined in the three-month period   from late March to late June.
Activity in the District's services sector has increased since our previous   report. Firms in the business support, human resources administration,   entertainment, hotel, and tire wholesale industries announced plans to expand   operations and hire new workers. In contrast, contacts in the government,   newspaper publishing, restaurant, and education industries reported plans to   decrease operations in the District and lay off employees. General retailers   report that sales have slowed in recent weeks. Auto dealers report inventory   shortages of quality used cars as well as new car models that contain parts   supplied by Japan.
Commercial and industrial real estate activity has experienced modest   improvement in some regions, while construction activity remained slow   throughout most of the District. A contact in central Arkansas reported that   while office real estate activity continues to be stagnant, there are more   commercial space inquires from national tenants. A contact in Memphis noted a   slight increase in office space demand in the first half of 2011 but noted   unchanged activity for industrial real estate. Contacts in St. Louis noted   demand growth for both industrial and office space but slow construction   activity. Contacts in Louisville reported increased industrial space leasing   activity and expect further demand growth in this sector as new construction   remains limited. Contacts in northeast Arkansas noted growth in commercial real   estate sales and construction in the Jonesboro and Paragould areas.
