The Eleventh District economy expanded moderately over the past six weeks.   The energy sector continued to be a source of strength, and staffing firms   reported demand held steady at high levels. Retailers said holiday sales were on   track to exceed those of last year. Reports from the manufacturing sector were   mostly positive. Construction activity in the district remained subdued and loan   demand was weak, however.
The price of crude oil increased about $10 per barrel during the reporting   period based on continued strength from Asia, better demand in the US, and a   weaker dollar. Retail prices for both gasoline and diesel rose with the price of   crude. The price of natural gas edged up seasonally, early in the reporting   period, but fell back to near $4 per McF by late December due to weak demand and   large inventories. Prices for most petrochemical products continued to rise   since the last report, according to respondents.
Respondents in high-tech manufacturing said demand continued to grow at a   moderate, sustainable pace since the last report. Contacts noted that production   was at high capacity and inventories had increased from very lean to desired   levels. Several firms said they had added slightly to payrolls. Areas of   strength included smart phones and gaming consoles, while demand for computers   was reported as "bouncing along the bottom." Most respondents expect growth to   continue at a moderate pace for the next three to six months.
Responses from paper producers were mixed, but overall demand remains at low   levels. Most expect conditions to remain stable as the economy slowly recovers.   Food manufacturers noted improved sales during the reporting period.   Transportation manufacturers also noted an increase in demand, and outlooks are   for modest growth in 2011.
Petrochemical producers noted strong domestic and export demand, except for   construction-related materials. North American producers of natural-gas based   resins and plastics continue to enjoy significant advantages in export markets.
Demand for oil products continued to improve against normal seasonal trends.   Refinery utilization rates moved up to the highest December levels since 2007.   Margins held steady, despite the surge in the price of crude oil. Suppliers   reported that refiners' confidence has improved.
Automobile sales held steady over the reporting period, and 2010 sales should   show a solid increase over 2009 levels. Contacts expected sales to be strong the   final week of December. Inventories rose modestly but are in the desired range.   The outlook for 2011 is for continued gradual improvement.
Accounting firms noted seasonal slowness, with demand about even with the   year-ago level. Contacts expect a reasonably good year in 2011 but noted demand   is unlikely to pick up substantially until clarity is reached on some public and   fiscal policy issues. Legal contacts noted an uptick in demand for   services--primarily corporate merger and acquisitions and real-estate services.   Demand overall was characterized as soft, but improving.
Reports from transportation services contacts were mixed, but mostly   positive. Railroad contacts noted business is much better than this time last   year and were optimistic in their outlooks. Shipping and intermodal contacts   said volumes were up from year-ago levels. Airlines reported continued steady   demand. Most contacts in the transportation services industry expect modest to   moderate growth this year. However, one intermodal shipping contact said higher   input costs had dampened his outlook.
Office and industrial leasing activity is spotty but appears to be moving in   a positive direction, according to respondents. Commercial construction activity   overall remained weak, despite increases in multifamily and hospital   construction activity.
