Business conditions in the Third District have improved somewhat since the   last Beige Book. Manufacturers, on balance, reported increases in shipments and   new orders in December. Retailers achieved moderate year-over-year increases in   sales during the holiday shopping period. Motor vehicle dealers also posted   year-to-year sales increases as 2010 came to a close. Third District banks   reported slight increases in loan volume outstanding since the last Beige Book,   mainly in personal loans. Residential real estate agents and homebuilders   indicated that sales have been seasonally slow. Contacts in the commercial real   estate sector said leasing and construction activity have remained at low levels   since the last Beige Book. Service-sector firms reported that activity has been   moving up slowly. Business contacts reported more instances of price increases   for inputs recently than they did in the previous Beige Book, and several said   they expect output price increases to become more common in 2011 than they were   in 2010.
Most Third District business contacts foresee improving economic conditions   in 2011, but they do not expect strong growth. Manufacturers forecast a rise in   shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers expect sales to   continue to move up on a year-over-year basis. Bankers expect modest growth in   lending. Contacts in residential real estate expect activity to increase   slightly. Contacts in commercial real estate expect only marginal strengthening   in market conditions. Service-sector companies expect continued slow growth in   the early months of 2011.
Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance. Among the firms surveyed in December, slightly more   than half expect increases in new orders and shipments, and less than one-tenth   expect decreases. Capital spending plans among area manufacturers have been   increasing since mid-year, and in December one-third of the manufacturers polled   said they planned higher capital outlays in the next six months, and less than   one-tenth planned cutbacks.
Third District auto dealers reported rising sales as 2010 came to a close.   Dealers said that inventories were increasing as they took delivery of new   models, but dealers generally considered their stocks of new and used vehicles   appropriate for the current sales rate. Dealers expect sales to be somewhat   higher in 2011 than in 2010, although several expressed concern that rising   gasoline prices could restrain sales of less fuel-efficient models.
Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that there has been little change   in commercial and industrial markets since the last Beige Book, although some   noted a few signs of improvement. Contacts said that vacancy rates and rents   have been nearly steady, but more tenants have signed long-term leases recently   compared with most of 2010, during which short-term leases were more common.   Several contacts in commercial construction reported that building owners have   recently shown more interest in renovation and new construction, although the   contemplated projects are not large. Commercial real estate contacts expect   market conditions to improve gradually in 2011. One contact said, "The outlook   is considerably less bearish, although it's not bullish," and another noted that   "the lack of new construction underway will support the beginning of a recovery   in leasing."
Business firms in the region reported mostly steady wages since the last   Beige Book. Staffing firms and employment agencies said they have recently seen   some growth in demand for temporary workers and slight increases in permanent   hiring, but no significant changes in wages or salaries.
