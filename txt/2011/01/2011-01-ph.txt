Business conditions in the Third District have improved somewhat since the   last Beige Book. Manufacturers, on balance, reported increases in shipments and   new orders in December. Retailers achieved moderate year-over-year increases in   sales during the holiday shopping period. Motor vehicle dealers also posted   year-to-year sales increases as 2010 came to a close. Third District banks   reported slight increases in loan volume outstanding since the last Beige Book,   mainly in personal loans. Residential real estate agents and homebuilders   indicated that sales have been seasonally slow. Contacts in the commercial real   estate sector said leasing and construction activity have remained at low levels   since the last Beige Book. Service-sector firms reported that activity has been   moving up slowly. Business contacts reported more instances of price increases   for inputs recently than they did in the previous Beige Book, and several said   they expect output price increases to become more common in 2011 than they were   in 2010. Most Third District business contacts foresee improving economic conditions   in 2011, but they do not expect strong growth. Manufacturers forecast a rise in   shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers expect sales to   continue to move up on a year-over-year basis. Bankers expect modest growth in   lending. Contacts in residential real estate expect activity to increase   slightly. Contacts in commercial real estate expect only marginal strengthening   in market conditions. Service-sector companies expect continued slow growth in   the early months of 2011. Manufacturing Third District manufacturers reported   increases in shipments and new orders from November to December, on balance.   However, gains were not spread among all of the region's major manufacturing   industries. Increases in demand for their products were common among producers   of furniture, chemicals, testing and measuring instruments, and food products.   In contrast, producers of metals, other industrial materials, lumber products,   electrical equipment, and machinery generally had month-to-month declines in   orders, and other manufacturing sectors reported no change. Overall, the   region's manufacturers continued to report that the flow of new orders has been   erratic. Several used the words "hand to mouth" and "choppy" to describe the   recent trend in orders. Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance. Among the firms surveyed in December, slightly more   than half expect increases in new orders and shipments, and less than one-tenth   expect decreases. Capital spending plans among area manufacturers have been   increasing since mid-year, and in December one-third of the manufacturers polled   said they planned higher capital outlays in the next six months, and less than   one-tenth planned cutbacks. Retail Third District retailers generally reported   year-over-year increases in line with plans for the year-end holiday shopping   period. On balance, stores posted moderate increases in sales without   significant unscheduled price reductions. Sales of winter outerwear and jewelry   rose fairly well from year-ago levels, but sales of big-ticket electronic items   were not strong. A snowstorm on the day after Christmas deterred some shoppers   and forced some store closings, but merchants said sales picked up in subsequent   days. "The shoppers came. We still did well," one merchant said. Looking ahead,   most of the retailers surveyed for this report said they expect continued   year-over-year increases in sales, although they also noted that consumer   confidence remains fragile. Third District auto dealers reported rising sales as 2010 came to a close.   Dealers said that inventories were increasing as they took delivery of new   models, but dealers generally considered their stocks of new and used vehicles   appropriate for the current sales rate. Dealers expect sales to be somewhat   higher in 2011 than in 2010, although several expressed concern that rising   gasoline prices could restrain sales of less fuel-efficient models. Finance At most of the Third District banks contacted for   this report, total outstanding loan volume has increased slightly since the last   Beige Book. In general, banks reported increases in lending on home equity lines   and credit cards but indicated that other types of lending were practically   flat. Some bank lending officers noted that usage of credit lines by business   firms continued to be low. Commercial bank officers generally indicated that   credit quality measures have been slowly improving. The outlook among Third   District bankers surveyed for this report is that lending to both consumers and   businesses will move up slowly in 2011. Bankers foresee gradual increases in   consumer lending if employment moves up, little or no gain in real estate   lending, and a slight increase in commercial and industrial lending. Real Estate and Construction Third District residential   real estate activity has slowed seasonally since the last Beige Book. Both   homebuilders and residential real estate agents generally indicated that the   usual winter lull in construction and sales had taken hold. In contrast, some   real estate agents reported an increase in rental activity of single-family   homes. Real estate agents attribute the rise in home rentals to several factors:   relocated owners unable to sell their houses at their asking prices, buyers   unable to obtain mortgages, and tightening of credit qualifications for renters   of apartments. Sales of higher-priced homes have continued to be slower than   sales of lower-priced homes in most parts of the region. Home prices have been   flat to down in most markets. Residential real estate contacts expect sales to   remain sluggish until economic conditions, especially employment, improve.   However, several contacts noted that sellers have recently become more willing   to reduce asking prices, and this appears to be giving some lift to the sales   trend. As one agent remarked, "When sellers get realistic, buyers respond." Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that there has been little change   in commercial and industrial markets since the last Beige Book, although some   noted a few signs of improvement. Contacts said that vacancy rates and rents   have been nearly steady, but more tenants have signed long-term leases recently   compared with most of 2010, during which short-term leases were more common.   Several contacts in commercial construction reported that building owners have   recently shown more interest in renovation and new construction, although the   contemplated projects are not large. Commercial real estate contacts expect   market conditions to improve gradually in 2011. One contact said, "The outlook   is considerably less bearish, although it's not bullish," and another noted that   "the lack of new construction underway will support the beginning of a recovery   in leasing." Services Service-sector firms generally reported slightly   rising activity since the previous Beige Book. Contacts said that the health   care sector continued to have relatively better gains than other sectors and   that service-sector activity related to construction continued to be weak. The   outlook for the services sector as a whole is modestly positive. One contact   said, "We see some slight improvement in the near term, but it will be well into   2011 before there is stronger growth." Prices and Wages Reports from manufacturers since the   last Beige Book indicated spreading increases in input costs, but mostly steady   output prices. Goods mentioned as rising in price were food products, chemicals,   petroleum products, metals, and electrical equipment. Several manufacturers   noted evidence of upward price pressure developing in their industries and said   they expect more widespread price increases for finished products during 2011.   Retailers generally noted more signs of rising costs since the last Beige Book.   They cited increases for food products, textile products, shipping charges, and   energy. However, many said that competition among stores was limiting increases   in retail prices. Business firms in the region reported mostly steady wages since the last   Beige Book. Staffing firms and employment agencies said they have recently seen   some growth in demand for temporary workers and slight increases in permanent   hiring, but no significant changes in wages or salaries.
