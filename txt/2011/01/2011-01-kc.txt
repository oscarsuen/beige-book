The District economy continued to expand in late November and December,   despite slower construction activity. Strong consumer spending over the holidays   lifted retail sales and expectations for future spending. Manufacturing activity   improved amid a rise in new orders and stronger durable goods production, and   some plant managers planned to increase capital spending and hire more workers.   Residential and commercial construction remained weak, though commercial real   estate sales edged up and vacancy rates dipped slightly. District bankers   reported stable banking conditions with some improvements in loan quality.   Energy activity expanded further, and incomes improved for the agricultural   sector. Even though several district contacts expected to increase employment,   wage pressures remained subdued. With raw materials prices continuing to climb,   more manufacturers expected to pass through higher input costs to finished goods   prices; however, most retailers did not plan to raise selling prices in the   coming months.
