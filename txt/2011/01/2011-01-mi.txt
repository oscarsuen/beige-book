The Ninth District economy continued its moderate recovery since the last   report. Consumer spending, tourism, services, manufacturing, energy, mining and   agriculture saw increases. Commercial real estate showed a slight but surprising   increase in activity; commercial construction was flat, and residential   construction and real estate decreased. Labor markets continued to strengthen   modestly, and wage increases remained generally subdued. Overall price increases   were modest, but some exceptions were noted among inputs.
According to an auto dealers association in Minnesota, new vehicle sales   through November were up slightly from a year ago; light trucks gained market   share relative to cars. A Minnesota domestic auto dealer reported strong   December sales.
Winter tourism activity was up from a year ago. Sales of snowmobiles   increased at two dealerships in central Minnesota compared with the previous   year, as early snowfall blanketed the region. A representative of a Minnesota   ski resort reported that winter sports activity in the area was well ahead of   last season due to good snow conditions and a better outlook for the economy.   However, rain and warm temperatures at the end of December led to deteriorating   snow conditions for cross country skiing and snowmobiling in northwestern   Wisconsin.
Commercial real estate showed a slight but surprising increase in activity.   In Minneapolis-St. Paul, several large leasing deals were announced and a large   suburban office tower was recently sold. A November survey by the University of   St. Thomas found increased optimism among Minnesota commercial real estate   market participants. A commercial broker and developer in Fargo said activity   there has picked up as well, with a reduction in the amount of empty retail   space. Residential real estate markets slowed. A November survey of Ninth   District real estate agents showed decreases in sales prices and transactions   and increases in inventory and time on market. November closed sales in   Minneapolis-St. Paul fell 39 percent from a year earlier, and median sales   prices declined more than 2 percent. In contrast, a real estate agent in   Bismarck, N.D., described the market there as healthy.
Wage increases remained generally subdued. However, a Minnesota all-terrain   vehicle powertrain manufacturer gave out bonuses for the first time in several   years following the company's relatively strong performance during 2010.
Overall price increases were modest, but some exceptions were noted among   inputs. Bank directors noted generally stable retail prices, but mentioned some   input price increases, such as copper and some steel products. Minnesota   gasoline prices at the end of December were about 20 cents per gallon higher   than a month earlier.
