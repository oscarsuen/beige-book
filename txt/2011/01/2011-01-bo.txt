Economic conditions continue to improve in the First District in the waning   months of 2010. Most contacted retailers report year-over-year sales increases,   manufacturers generally continue to see expansion, and advertising and   consulting firms cite relatively strong growth. Respondents in these three   sectors indicate employment is stable to rising, with more of the same planned   for 2011. Commercial real estate markets are said to be stable, while   residential real estate continues in the doldrums. Selected commodities are   causing some price pressures, but contacts report only modest pass-through into   sales prices to date. The outlook for 2011 is generally positive, albeit   moderate.
Contacts report mixed inventory levels in comparison to plan. As for prices,   retailers note cost increases for commodities, including cotton, rubber, and   nuts. Several respondents observe price pressure in the industry, but have yet   to experience it themselves. Some contacts have worked to lock in pricing   through vendor contracts; a couple say that vendors may be absorbing price   increases or working to cover increases through product reengineering to keep   their selling prices steady. Retailers say that price increases passed on to   consumers, if any, will be selective. Headcounts continue to increase in line   with new store openings, although a few firms are taking measures to reduce   redundancy and consolidate headcount to gain other efficiencies. One respondent   is concerned that uncertain potential employer costs associated with healthcare   reform may affect hiring. Capital spending is mixed, with several retailers   reducing capital spending now that one-time expansion projects have been   completed. Outlooks are generally cautiously optimistic, with most contacts   forecasting a slow and steady improvement in 2011.
A number of contacted firms continue to try to reduce or limit their   inventories to maintain lean operations. By contrast, a few other firms report   trying to increase their inventories somewhat either to meet higher demand or to   try to offset continued supply constraints or disruptions. Plastics are one   intermediate input that remains difficult to obtain, and a semi-conductor   manufacturer reports that components necessary for its production process remain   in short supply. These supply constraints have yet to translate into higher   input or output prices for the affected firms. Increases in commodity prices are   the main source of price pressure amongst responding firms; the prices of   precious metals continue to rise as do the prices of grains and sugars. The   manufacturers affected by these higher input prices have tried to pass along   some or all of their increased costs to consumers in the fourth quarter or they   plan price increases in early 2011, but they are not certain the increases will   stick. Overall, selling prices remain relatively stable at the majority of   contacted manufacturers.
Manufacturers continue to report stable to slightly increasing employment.   The firms that are hiring tend to be increasing their headcount in skilled   positions and/or in production workers to meet increased demand; none are   planning substantial increases. Firms' capital expenditures are little changed   from previous reports. Most contacted companies anticipate their capital   spending in 2011 will be roughly in line with 2010. Those firms who have   increased capital expenditures or plan to do so are directing the spending   toward IT upgrades or increased plant capacity.
Manufacturing respondents have mixed, but generally positive outlooks for   2011. One firm reports being "very optimistic" about next year, while most are   "cautiously optimistic." In comparison, the firm that has been struggling   recently said the outlook for the next three to six months is "lackluster." Many   contacted firms remain concerned about their health care costs going forward,   and a few expect that the macroeconomic uncertainty will continue to weigh on   their sales growth.
Most contacts are highly optimistic about their near-term performance and   throughout 2011, mostly based on the increased volume of deals already secured   and growing inquiries from clients. Expectations about general economic recovery   in 2011 contribute to these projections as well. They expect annual growth in   revenue ranging from 5 percent to 15 percent.
The outlook ranges from quite cautious to solidly optimistic. Boston and   Hartford contacts expect slow growth and only limited absorption in 2011.   Prospects for absorption in 2011 were more robust in Providence and Portland,   and a Boston banking contact expects very strong loan demand for commercial   properties throughout 2011. No contacts are predicting a "double-dip" in the   commercial real estate market (nor for the economy as a whole). Nonetheless, a   few are concerned that commercial foreclosures could increase in 2011, putting   downward pressure on property values.
Contacts anticipate a continuation of current sluggish activity levels into   2011, with fewer swings than in 2010. Some respondents express concern about   possible tax reforms restricting the mortgage interest deduction.
