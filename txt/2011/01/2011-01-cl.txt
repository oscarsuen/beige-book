On balance, economic activity in the Fourth District expanded at a modest   pace since our last report. Manufacturers reported some improvement in demand.   Information received from retailers and auto dealers on the holiday shopping   season was generally positive. Energy production and freight transport volume   were stable. Residential and nonresidential construction remained sluggish. And   while demand for business loans showed some signs of a pickup, consumer   borrowing was weak.
Reports of rising payrolls were limited to the manufacturing sector.   Staffing-firm representatives noted an increase in the number of new job   openings, with vacancies concentrated in professional business services. Wage   pressures continue to be contained. Apart from elevated commodity and steel   prices, raw materials and product pricing were fairly steady.
Capacity utilization continues to trend higher, approaching what many of our   respondents consider to be more normal rates. Inventories are close to targeted   levels. Capital spending plans are conservative, with only a few of our contacts   expecting to increase capital budgets for 2011. Outlays are aimed primarily at   maintenance, equipment upgrades, and increasing production efficiencies. Prices   for agricultural and metal commodities, steel, and scrap remain elevated, while   the prices of most other raw materials have been stable. Several producers   announced selective product price increases to reflect a rise in the cost of   steel and agricultural commodities. Most contacts told us that they have   expanded their permanent, full-time payrolls slightly since our last survey, and   they will continue hiring at the same pace during 2011. Permanent new hires were   largely salaried. To meet rising demand, employers are extending production   hours or bringing in temporary hourly workers. Wage pressures are contained.   Companies are continuing to restore merit increases and payments to 401K   plans.
Discussions with nonresidential builders drew mixed responses, with a small   majority of our contacts reporting stronger activity than a year ago. There is   growing concern over the continuing slowdown in inquiries and tightening   margins. However, most builders said they had a sufficient backlog to keep them   busy in the upcoming months. New projects generally fall into the health-care   category, with some industrial and infrastructure work. Our contacts are   uncertain about business conditions through 2011. A few builders mentioned that   their customers have the ability to fund projects, but they are hesitant to   commit. Builders expect construction material suppliers to begin raising prices   early in 2011, but they are uncertain as to the amount or whether the increases   will stick. General contractors reported no change in employment levels and   wages. Subcontractors continue to cope with very difficult industry   conditions.
Auto dealers reported new vehicle sales during November were steady to up   slightly on a month-over-month basis. When compared to year-ago levels, sales   were generally higher. A few of our contacts also noted an increase in leasing   activity. Looking forward, dealers expect sales to follow seasonal trends   through the winter months. However, they anticipate that sales will be slightly   higher than the prior year's level. New car inventories are in line with demand.   Reports on used vehicle purchases were mixed. Little change was seen in credit   availability. Buyers with high credit scores can readily obtain financing.   Dealers' spending on showroom upgrades to comply with factory mandates remains   modest. More aggressive capital outlays are dependent on sustainable demand.
