The Second District's economy has shown further signs of improvement since   the last report. Hiring has continued to pick up outside of the manufacturing   sector. Business contacts in most sectors report improved conditions and express   widespread optimism about the near-term outlook. Cost pressures have risen but   consumer prices have remained generally stable. Retail sales over the holiday   season were generally strong and ahead of expectations, though post-holiday   sales were adversely affected by the late-December blizzard. Tourism activity   has remained brisk and consumer confidence has improved moderately since the   last report. Commercial real estate has been mixed: there have been scattered   signs of improvement in the office market, but the market for industrial space   has weakened. Housing markets have also been mixed but generally weak. Finally,   bankers report mixed loan demand overall and tightening credit standards on   commercial loans and mortgages.
Automobile sales were mixed but generally at favorable levels, as both retail   and wholesale credit conditions continued to improve. Rochester-area dealers   report that sales of new autos surged 24 percent from a year ago in November and   appear to be running about 10 percent ahead in December, helped by incentives.   On the other hand, dealers in the Buffalo area report that sales were down   slightly from a year earlier in November and remained fairly sluggish in   December; the inclement weather was seen to be a factor.
Tourism activity in New York City has remained fairly brisk since the last   report. Manhattan hotels report that occupancy rates remained close to 90   percent in November and December, while room rates continued to run nearly 10   percent ahead of comparable 2009 levels. The late-December snowstorm appears to   have had little net effect on occupancy: while many visitors had to cancel their   reservations, others who were unable to leave extended their stays. Broadway   theaters report that both attendance and total revenues were running about 10   percent ahead of a year earlier in late November and most of December, despite   the recent closing of a number of shows. Theaters remained open during and after   the post-Christmas blizzard, though attendance is expected to be down   noticeably. The Buffalo area saw a modest pickup in tourism during the final   week of December, buoyed by a worldwide junior hockey tournament. Finally, the   Conference Board reports that consumer confidence among residents of the Middle   Atlantic states (NY, NJ, PA) climbed in both November and December, ending the   year at the highest level since May.
Commercial real estate markets have been mixed, with scattered signs of   improvement in the office market, but some softening evident in the industrial   market. In New York City, office leasing activity rose to a four-year high,   though much of the new leasing reportedly involved companies moving around   (often to smaller quarters). Still, there was some net absorption of office   space, and vacancy rates declined moderately. Asking rents were generally stable   but rose in some prime areas of Manhattan. There were also signs of modest   improvement in the Buffalo and Rochester areas, where vacancy rates edged down   and rents were up 4 to 5 percent from a year earlier. On the other hand, office   vacancy rates climbed and rents edged down in Long Island, while markets in   northern New Jersey, Westchester and Fairfield County (CT) were stable.   Industrial vacancy rates were little changed, but rents declined across most of   the District--particularly in the Albany and Rochester areas, and in New York   City. Both residential and commercial construction activity remain at   exceptionally low levels throughout the District. A commercial developer in   western New York State notes that many small sub-contractors have exited the   business and medium-sized firms are struggling.
