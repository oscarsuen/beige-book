The Twelfth District economy firmed further during the reporting period of   late November through the end of December. Price pressures for final goods and   services remained limited despite increases for selected raw materials, and   upward wage pressures were largely absent. Holiday retail sales were up notably   compared with a year earlier, and demand continued to expand for consumer and   business services. District manufacturing activity grew further on net, with   sustained improvement noted for metal fabricators. Production activity remained   solid for agricultural producers, and demand grew on balance for providers of   energy resources. Home sales and construction stayed sluggish, and conditions   continued to be weak overall in commercial real estate markets. Reports from   District banking contacts indicated that loan demand was little changed from   existing low levels.
Contacts in most sectors characterized wages as essentially flat, although   some continued to point to substantial increases in the costs of health   insurance and other employee benefits. The most significant wage pressures were   reported for workers with advanced skills in high-tech fields, for whom demand   has been growing at a brisk clip in some parts of the District. Contacts in most   sectors expect hiring activity to pick up over the next six months, but to a   very modest degree, suggesting that wage pressures overall will remain quite   limited during the first half of 2011.
Demand increased further for business and consumer services on balance. Sales   continued to expand for providers of technology services, including biomedical   products, but they remained largely flat for providers of professional and media   services. Restaurants and other food-service providers noted further modest   improvements in demand, and suppliers of energy services reported increased   deliveries to end-use customers. By contrast, providers of health-care services   reported that demand weakened slightly in recent months. Conditions continued to   improve for businesses in the travel and tourism industry. Contacts from several   major markets in the District noted increases in visitor volumes and hotel   occupancies, which resulted from rising business travel as well as tourism.
