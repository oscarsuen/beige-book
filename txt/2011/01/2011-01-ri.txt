Economic activity improved in the District over the last four to six weeks.   The manufacturing sector posted solid gains in December, with many firms citing   strength in both orders and shipments. Retailers in the District reported a   spike in December sales, along with a marked increase in foot traffic. Modest   revenue growth continued at most services firms. Tourism in the District   benefited from an early start to the skiing season. The banking sector reported   moderate improvements in business loan demand, particularly for industrial   equipment. Contacts at temporary employment agencies stated that demand was flat   to up slightly. While residential real estate activity was mixed, several   commercial Realtors cited a pickup in sales activity, but commercial   construction continued to be weak.
Port-related activity in the final months of the year was somewhat mixed, but   remained generally above year-ago levels. A port contact reported that imports   from Asia provided most of December's year-over-year increase in volume traffic,   while exports held steady. Another port official stated that exports of both   bulk and container goods remained strong and noted that the weak dollar helped   support commodity exports to Europe. Overall, however, both imports and exports   of commodities and finished goods slowed a bit over the last month. Some of the   slowdown on the import side was attributed to weakness in the local economies,   with retail goods from China accounting for much of the slowing but apparel   goods from South America still holding up well. However, a container shipper   described the volume of his goods both into and out of ports as "firm and solid,   but not booming." And a railroad official stated that his port-related freight   volumes were running a little stronger than a year ago, but noted that he did   not see the usual growth in traffic during November over the previous month.
While commercial real estate activity remained weak throughout the District,   reports of modest improvement increased since our last report. For example, a   Realtor in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina reported that property   sales were moving briskly, although partly because prices were low. Contacts   indicated that leasing activity in the area also improved, particularly at   locations that already had relatively high occupancy rates. Apartment   construction edged up, according to District reports, particularly in the   Washington, DC area. A survey of construction contractors showed an even split   among increasing, decreasing and no change in activity over the past six weeks.   Most respondents noted little change in credit availability, with many still   having difficulty obtaining credit. Moreover, price pressures remained intense,   with most indicating that not only were materials prices increasing but also   that intense competition, even for small projects, was squeezing profit   margins.
