Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic   activity continued to expand moderately from November through December.   Conditions were said to be improving in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and   Richmond Districts. Activity increased modestly to moderately in the Cleveland,   Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. The economy of   the Minneapolis District "continued its moderate recovery," while that of the   San Francisco District "firmed further" in the reporting period leading up to   the close of 2010. Conditions were generally said to be better in Districts'   manufacturing, retail, and nonfinancial services sectors than in financial   services or real estate.
Contacts in the manufacturing sector in all Districts reported that activity   continued to recover, with the Richmond and Chicago Districts citing especially   solid gains in orders. However, the Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts noted   that business remained weak for manufacturers selling into the construction   sector. Retailers in all Districts indicated that sales appeared to be higher in   this holiday season than in 2009 and, in some cases, better than expectations.   Nonfinancial service-sector contacts in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia,   Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San   Francisco Districts cited demand increases ranging from slight to "relatively   strong." Transportation services were more mixed, with the Cleveland, Atlanta,   and Kansas City Districts noting stable to slowing shipping volumes. Financial   conditions were mixed across the Districts reporting on it, with overall loan   demand slowly improving in Philadelphia and Richmond and weaker in St. Louis and   Dallas. The Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco   Districts cited increased activity in the energy sector, while energy production   in the Cleveland District was stable.
Residential real estate markets remained weak across all Districts.   Commercial construction was described as subdued or slow, while commercial   leasing activity reportedly increased in the Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and   Kansas City Districts.
Most District reports cited comments by both retailers and manufacturers that   costs were rising, but indicated that competitive pressures had led to only   modest pass-through into final prices. Labor markets appeared to be firming   somewhat in most Districts, as some modest hiring beyond replacement was said to   have occurred and/or was planned in a variety of sectors. At the same time,   however, upward pressure on wages was reportedly very limited.
Most Districts indicated that business contacts were positive about the   outlook, although still generally cautious. The Dallas District noted modest   increases in optimism and positive outlooks across a range of sectors, Chicago   stated that contacts were cautiously optimistic about the 2011 outlook, and New   York cited widespread optimism about the near-term outlook; The St. Louis,   Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all pointed to planned   increases in hiring by their contacts as evidence of expected strengthening in   business activity in 2011. Contacts in the Philadelphia District foresaw   "improving economic conditions in 2011, but â€¦ not strong growth."
The manufacturing sector continued to   recover across all Districts. Contacts in the Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis   Districts identified a strong flow of new orders. Respondents in the Chicago   District pointed to pent-up demand for both light and heavy motor vehicles,   attributed to an aging fleet, as a key driver of activity in the manufacturing   sector. The Cleveland District described orders as above expectations and   respondents in the New York District noted that orders had picked up since the   prior report. Overall, demand was generally characterized as stable and steady,   and no District made mention of lingering fears of a double-dip recession, in   contrast to the summer reporting periods. Capacity utilization continued to   trend higher and is approaching normal rates for some contacts in the Cleveland   and San Francisco Districts, while production in high-tech manufacturing was   reportedly at high capacity in Dallas; some manufacturers in the St. Louis and   Minneapolis Districts said they have or will soon expand capacity. Production   levels increased in the Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts.   On the negative side, the Philadelphia District characterized the flow of new   orders as "erratic," while the Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts identified   construction-related manufacturers as continuing to show considerable weakness,   and makers of wood products in the St. Louis and San Francisco Districts   reported very soft demand.
The Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts reported concerns about   input prices, particularly of commodities; manufacturers in the Boston,   Cleveland, and Richmond Districts indicated they had experienced lengthening   lead times, shortages, or other difficulty obtaining supplies of some inputs.   Only St. Louis mentioned firms with substantial investment plans for 2011.   Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported that some   factories had plans to increase employment, although these hiring plans were   typically characterized as modest. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas   City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts described the 2011 manufacturing   outlook as optimistic.
Retail spending showed   improvement across all Districts, with most retailers reporting sales growth   consistent with or ahead of plan for the recent 2010 holiday season. Boston,   Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City observed consumers positively   reacting to promotions and discounting, although Philadelphia and San Francisco   reported that retailers relied less heavily on discounting. Inclement weather,   including the late December blizzard, had some impact on sales in the New York   and Philadelphia Districts. New York , Cleveland, and Chicago cited increased   consumer confidence.
Automobile sales were either steady or up in eight Districts during the   reporting period, while New York stated that auto sales were "mixed but   generally at favorable levels" and Kansas City noted limited auto sales but   expected future improvement from additional incentives. Philadelphia, Cleveland,   and Dallas indicated that vehicle inventories were at appropriate levels for the   current sales rate. Cleveland reported an increase in leasing activity, while   the effect of rising gasoline prices on sales of less fuel-efficient models was   a concern cited by some dealers in Philadelphia.
Tourism was characterized as positive or improved in the Richmond, Atlanta,   Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, while New York described   tourist activity as brisk. Contacts from the Richmond, Kansas City, and   Minneapolis Districts observed a strong start to the winter ski season, although   unfavorable weather conditions at the end of December led to deteriorating   conditions for winter activities in some areas of the Minneapolis District. New   York City's Broadway theaters reported increased attendance and revenue compared   with the 2009 holiday season. Occupancy rose in the Atlanta and San Francisco   Districts' major hotel markets. Room rates continued to run ahead of comparable   2009 levels in the New York and the Kansas City Districts, although rates have   fallen in Kansas City since the last survey. Atlanta and San Francisco noted   rising business travel.
Activity was said to be steady to   increasing among Districts reporting on nonfinancial services. Providers of   information technology services saw increases in sales in the Kansas City and   San Francisco Districts. Advertising and consulting contacts in the Boston   District reported significant growth in demand. In the Dallas District, legal   firms noted an uptick in demand for services, while accounting firms reported   seasonal slowness. Reports from the healthcare sector were mixed; St. Louis and   Minneapolis reported ongoing increases in demand for healthcare workers, while   San Francisco indicated a slight weakening in demand for healthcare services and   Richmond reported little change. Demand for staffing services remained on an   upward trend, with increases reported by New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and   Chicago. In addition, an employment-agency contact in the New York District   observed increased demand for employees in the legal and financial services   sectors, while the Dallas District noted strong, steady demand for workers in   the professional, technical, healthcare, and finance fields. Reports from the   transportation services sector were mixed, with increased demand reported by   trucking firms and airports in the Richmond District, and slower overall   activity in the Kansas City District. Freight companies in the Cleveland   District noted stable volumes over the past six weeks, and contacts in the   Atlanta District reported moderating freight volumes after significant increases   in earlier 2010 reporting periods.
Activity in residential real   estate and new home construction remained slow across all Districts. A majority   of the Districts, including Boston, New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago,   Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco characterized local housing markets as   weak and sluggish with little change from the previous reporting period. Kansas   City noted further weakening, while Richmond received reports of both flat   activity and further declines. The St. Louis District saw additional declines in   existing home sales, but also cited increased new home construction permits. All   Districts attributed slumping activity to concerns about the pace of economic   recovery, especially in employment, while the Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago   Districts mentioned difficulty obtaining credit as another constraint on demand.   High levels of existing home inventories continued to damp the pace of new home   construction in most Districts reporting on construction, although Boston,   Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco mentioned pick-ups in multifamily   construction within their Districts. Home prices generally declined or held   steady in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago,   Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts; the New York, Atlanta,   Chicago, and San Francisco Districts mentioned distressed properties placing   downward pressure on prices. Boston reported rising median home prices across   most states in the District, but contacts attributed those increases to   relatively higher sales of more expensive properties rather than a general   upward movement in home prices. Outlooks for residential real estate in the   coming year were mixed, with contacts in most Districts described as expecting   continued weak conditions.
Commercial real estate markets displayed mixed results across the Districts   again this reporting period, as leasing markets exhibited increasing signs of   recovery and nonresidential construction remained weak. Leasing activity   increased modestly in the Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City   Districts and showed tentative improvement in the Dallas District. Vacancy   rates, while quite high across the country, fell marginally in the Kansas City   District and in New York City's office market. Leasing market fundamentals held   roughly steady in the Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts.   Commercial construction activity was described as very limited across most   Districts, with the bulk of new activity coming from projects related to   healthcare, public infrastructure, and multifamily housing. Contacts in most   Districts expected modest improvements in commercial leasing in 2011, although   the outlook for construction was mixed and some Districts noted rising costs as   a concern.
Reports on credit activity   were mixed across Federal Reserve Districts. Overall, loan demand was reported   as stable in San Francisco, mixed in New York, steady to slightly softer in   Kansas City, weaker in St. Louis and Dallas, and slowly improving in   Philadelphia and Richmond. Demand for consumer loans declined in the New York,   Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. By contrast,   consumer lending increased in the Dallas District, and exceeded expectations in   the Chicago District. Bankers in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Richmond   anticipate consumer lending to expand in 2011. Demand for commercial and   industrial loans was flat in New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Lenders   in the New York, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco   Districts noted a drop in residential mortgage refinancing owing to the recent   rise in interest rates, whereas Richmond reported strong demand for home   refinancing. The Cleveland and Richmond Districts observed a pick-up in auto   lending. Demand for residential real estate loans eased in New York and Kansas   City, remained weak in Cleveland and Dallas, but increased in the Richmond   District. Real estate lending declined in the St. Louis District. Lending in the   commercial mortgage category increased in New York, was unchanged in Kansas   City, and was weak in Dallas, with the exception of multifamily. Most Districts   reporting on credit quality described it as improving, while bankers in the   Cleveland District said that quality remained stable or edged up slightly.   Reports on credit standards were mixed in New York, while standards were said to   have eased somewhat in Atlanta, remained restrictive in San Francisco, and held   steady in Kansas City. Delinquency rates were flat or trending down in   Cleveland, while delinquency rates in the New York District rose for commercial   mortgages, decreased in the consumer lending category, and remained unchanged   for all other loans. Total deposits rose in the Cleveland and St. Louis   Districts and were stable in the Kansas City District.
Unfavorable weather   conditions damped agricultural production in some areas. The Dallas District   reported that drought negatively affected range conditions by adding to costs of   feeding livestock, while Atlanta cited the challenges prolonged drought   presented to fruit growers. The Kansas City District indicated that dry weather   could affect winter wheat development. Large snow falls hampered some ranchers   in the Minneapolis District. However, agricultural demand generally improved   among reporting Districts, and output prices rose, especially for corn,   soybeans, wheat, cattle, and cotton.
The Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported increased   drilling activity. Cleveland cited fairly stable oil production, while the   Atlanta District experienced the highest level of oil production in more than   six years during the fourth quarter of 2010. Prices for crude oil and natural   gas either stayed steady or slightly increased in the Cleveland, Minneapolis,   Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Cleveland reported steady coal production and   prices, while the St. Louis District saw coal production increase.
Most District reports mentioned   increasing prevalence of cost pressures but only modest pass-through into final   prices because of competitive pressures. Philadelphia and San Francisco noted   somewhat reduced discounting in the retail sector during the holiday selling   season, while New York, Minneapolis, and Dallas indicated retail prices were   stable, Richmond said retail price increases had slowed, and Chicago and Kansas   City cited discounting or depressed retail margins. For both retailers and   manufacturers, increases in selling prices, if occurring, were said to be   selective. Specific markets or products identified as experiencing high or   rising prices included various food products, steel and other metals, building   materials, textiles, chemicals, and petroleum-related products. Many Districts   mentioned concerns among business contacts that petroleum-related prices,   already above year-earlier levels, will continue rising in 2011. The   Philadelphia and Kansas City reports indicated that manufacturing firms planned   to attempt more price increases in 2011, while some manufacturers in the Boston   District were uncertain their price increases would stick and the Chicago report   projected only "limited and gradual" pass-through.
Labor markets in most Districts appear to be firming somewhat, but with   virtually no upward pressure on wages. All District reports indicated that   employment levels are rising in at least some sectors, generally by modest   amounts; however, some employers in the New York, St. Louis, and Minneapolis   Districts also mentioned job cuts. Staffing firms in the New York, Philadelphia,   Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts gave positive reports;   Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta said some firms were raising work hours instead   of or in addition to hiring. The Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis,   Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts indicated that business   contacts planned to continue or increase their pace of hiring in 2011. Some   employers in the Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts expressed concern   about added costs for healthcare; the Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago Districts   noted selected skill shortages in some sectors. Overall wage pressures remained   subdued; the Philadelphia District reported "mostly steady wages," Cleveland   said "wage pressures are contained," Chicago indicated "wage pressures remained   moderate," Minneapolis and Kansas City stated wage increases or wage pressure   "remained subdued," and the Dallas and San Francisco reports described wage   pressures as "minimal" or "largely absent."
