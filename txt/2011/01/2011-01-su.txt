Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and based   on information collected on or before January 3, 2011. This document summarizes   comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve   and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.
Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic   activity continued to expand moderately from November through December.   Conditions were said to be improving in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and   Richmond Districts. Activity increased modestly to moderately in the Cleveland,   Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. The economy of   the Minneapolis District "continued its moderate recovery," while that of the   San Francisco District "firmed further" in the reporting period leading up to   the close of 2010. Conditions were generally said to be better in Districts'   manufacturing, retail, and nonfinancial services sectors than in financial   services or real estate.
Contacts in the manufacturing sector in all Districts reported that activity   continued to recover, with the Richmond and Chicago Districts citing especially   solid gains in orders. However, the Boston, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts noted   that business remained weak for manufacturers selling into the construction   sector. Retailers in all Districts indicated that sales appeared to be higher in   this holiday season than in 2009 and, in some cases, better than expectations.   Nonfinancial service-sector contacts in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia,   Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San   Francisco Districts cited demand increases ranging from slight to "relatively   strong." Transportation services were more mixed, with the Cleveland, Atlanta,   and Kansas City Districts noting stable to slowing shipping volumes. Financial   conditions were mixed across the Districts reporting on it, with overall loan   demand slowly improving in Philadelphia and Richmond and weaker in St. Louis and   Dallas. The Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco   Districts cited increased activity in the energy sector, while energy production   in the Cleveland District was stable.
Residential real estate markets remained weak across all Districts.   Commercial construction was described as subdued or slow, while commercial   leasing activity reportedly increased in the Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and   Kansas City Districts.
Most District reports cited comments by both retailers and manufacturers that   costs were rising, but indicated that competitive pressures had led to only   modest pass-through into final prices. Labor markets appeared to be firming   somewhat in most Districts, as some modest hiring beyond replacement was said to   have occurred and/or was planned in a variety of sectors. At the same time,   however, upward pressure on wages was reportedly very limited.
Most Districts indicated that business contacts were positive about the   outlook, although still generally cautious. The Dallas District noted modest   increases in optimism and positive outlooks across a range of sectors, Chicago   stated that contacts were cautiously optimistic about the 2011 outlook, and New   York cited widespread optimism about the near-term outlook; The St. Louis,   Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all pointed to planned   increases in hiring by their contacts as evidence of expected strengthening in   business activity in 2011. Contacts in the Philadelphia District foresaw   "improving economic conditions in 2011, but â€¦ not strong growth."
The Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts reported concerns about   input prices, particularly of commodities; manufacturers in the Boston,   Cleveland, and Richmond Districts indicated they had experienced lengthening   lead times, shortages, or other difficulty obtaining supplies of some inputs.   Only St. Louis mentioned firms with substantial investment plans for 2011.   Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported that some   factories had plans to increase employment, although these hiring plans were   typically characterized as modest. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas   City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts described the 2011 manufacturing   outlook as optimistic.
Automobile sales were either steady or up in eight Districts during the   reporting period, while New York stated that auto sales were "mixed but   generally at favorable levels" and Kansas City noted limited auto sales but   expected future improvement from additional incentives. Philadelphia, Cleveland,   and Dallas indicated that vehicle inventories were at appropriate levels for the   current sales rate. Cleveland reported an increase in leasing activity, while   the effect of rising gasoline prices on sales of less fuel-efficient models was   a concern cited by some dealers in Philadelphia.
Tourism was characterized as positive or improved in the Richmond, Atlanta,   Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, while New York described   tourist activity as brisk. Contacts from the Richmond, Kansas City, and   Minneapolis Districts observed a strong start to the winter ski season, although   unfavorable weather conditions at the end of December led to deteriorating   conditions for winter activities in some areas of the Minneapolis District. New   York City's Broadway theaters reported increased attendance and revenue compared   with the 2009 holiday season. Occupancy rose in the Atlanta and San Francisco   Districts' major hotel markets. Room rates continued to run ahead of comparable   2009 levels in the New York and the Kansas City Districts, although rates have   fallen in Kansas City since the last survey. Atlanta and San Francisco noted   rising business travel.
Commercial real estate markets displayed mixed results across the Districts   again this reporting period, as leasing markets exhibited increasing signs of   recovery and nonresidential construction remained weak. Leasing activity   increased modestly in the Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City   Districts and showed tentative improvement in the Dallas District. Vacancy   rates, while quite high across the country, fell marginally in the Kansas City   District and in New York City's office market. Leasing market fundamentals held   roughly steady in the Boston, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts.   Commercial construction activity was described as very limited across most   Districts, with the bulk of new activity coming from projects related to   healthcare, public infrastructure, and multifamily housing. Contacts in most   Districts expected modest improvements in commercial leasing in 2011, although   the outlook for construction was mixed and some Districts noted rising costs as   a concern.
The Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported increased   drilling activity. Cleveland cited fairly stable oil production, while the   Atlanta District experienced the highest level of oil production in more than   six years during the fourth quarter of 2010. Prices for crude oil and natural   gas either stayed steady or slightly increased in the Cleveland, Minneapolis,   Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Cleveland reported steady coal production and   prices, while the St. Louis District saw coal production increase.
Labor markets in most Districts appear to be firming somewhat, but with   virtually no upward pressure on wages. All District reports indicated that   employment levels are rising in at least some sectors, generally by modest   amounts; however, some employers in the New York, St. Louis, and Minneapolis   Districts also mentioned job cuts. Staffing firms in the New York, Philadelphia,   Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts gave positive reports;   Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta said some firms were raising work hours instead   of or in addition to hiring. The Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis,   Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts indicated that business   contacts planned to continue or increase their pace of hiring in 2011. Some   employers in the Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts expressed concern   about added costs for healthcare; the Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago Districts   noted selected skill shortages in some sectors. Overall wage pressures remained   subdued; the Philadelphia District reported "mostly steady wages," Cleveland   said "wage pressures are contained," Chicago indicated "wage pressures remained   moderate," Minneapolis and Kansas City stated wage increases or wage pressure   "remained subdued," and the Dallas and San Francisco reports described wage   pressures as "minimal" or "largely absent."
