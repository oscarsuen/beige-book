Reports from Sixth District business contacts indicated that economic   activity rose moderately in late November and December. Holiday sales were   described as generally positive and above expectations. Tourism contacts noted   increases for both business and leisure travel. Weakness continued to be   reported in the real estate sector as both builders and brokers noted very low   levels of activity. Most manufacturers noted a slight increase in new orders and   production levels, although those producing construction-related goods continued   to experience lower activity. Transportation companies reported moderating   freight volumes after significant increases earlier this year. Business contacts   continued to report that obtaining loans at acceptable terms has remained   difficult, especially for small businesses and start-ups. Bankers repeated that   they experienced a lack of loan demand from qualified borrowers. Employment   indicators continued to recover, albeit slowly. Most business contacts said that   they remain hesitant to add to their permanent workforce until they experienced   a sustained increase in sales. A majority of business contacts indicated that   current cost pressures remained high, citing increasing material prices and   rising labor and benefits outlays. However, most firms remained reluctant to   pass input cost increases through to consumers given intense competitive   pressures.
Tourism activity increased slightly relative to a year ago for both business   and leisure travel and the outlook remained modestly positive going into 2011.   Hotel occupancy rates rose in several of the District's major markets compared   with last year. Cruise lines reported an increase in both bookings and pricing   power.
Residential broker reports indicated that the pace of existing home sales   growth remained weak compared with a year ago, but declines were more modest   than in recent reports. Contacts also indicated that home sales at the low-end   of the market weakened notably. Throughout the region, short-sales, REOs, and   pending foreclosures continued to put downward pressure on home prices which   remained below year-earlier levels in most areas. Realtor outlooks for sales   growth over the next several months improved somewhat from previous reports.
Nonresidential construction activity remained at low levels through the end   of the year. Commercial contractors said that the pace of development and   backlogs remained below the year-earlier level. Contacts indicated that access   to funding remained challenging and competition for projects had become more   intense. Many indicated that they expected the commercial market to remain   constrained in 2011.
A majority of business contacts indicated that current cost pressures were   higher, citing increasing material prices and rising labor and benefit costs.   Many firms also noted that they were setting aside funds for expected future   increases in employment taxes and healthcare costs. However, firms remained   reluctant to pass input cost increases through to consumers given intense   competitive pressures. Nearly all contacts noted that markups were either near   or below what they considered to be normal, reporting that increased   productivity has placed some downward pressure on product prices.
Most of the Southeast continued to experience varying degrees of prolonged   drought. Reports also indicated that both the lack of rain and   colder-than-average temperatures have presented challenges to Florida citrus   growers. The drought has reduced the physical size of the fruit slightly, and   the recent cold snaps have affected young new plantings. Supplies of both cotton   and soybeans continue to be tight with strong global demand keeping prices   high.
