Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic   activity generally continued to expand since the last report, though a few   Districts indicated some deceleration. Some slowing in the pace of growth was   noted in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. In   contrast, Dallas characterized that region's economy as accelerating. Other   Districts indicated that growth continued at a steady pace. Manufacturing   activity continued to expand in most parts of the country, though a number of   Districts noted some slowing in the pace of growth. Activity in the   non-financial service sectors expanded at a steady pace, led by industries   related to information technology and business and professional services.
Consumer spending was mixed, with most Districts indicating steady to   modestly increasing activity. Elevated food and energy prices, as well as   unfavorable weather in some parts of the country, were said to be weighing on   consumers' propensity to spend. Auto sales were mixed but fairly robust in most   of the country, though some slowing was noted in the Northeastern regions.   Widespread supply disruptions--primarily related to the disaster in Japan--were   reported to have substantially reduced the flow of new automobiles into dealers'   inventories, which in turn held down sales in some Districts. Widespread   shortages of used cars were also reported to be driving up prices. Tourism   activity improved in most Districts.
Residential construction and real estate continued to show widespread   weakness, except in the rental segment, where market conditions have   strengthened and construction activity and development have picked up.   Non-residential real estate leasing markets have been generally stable, while   construction activity has remained very subdued. Loan demand was steady to   stronger in most Districts, especially in the commercial and industrial sector,   and widespread improvement was reported in credit quality.
Agricultural conditions were unfavorable across much of the nation, largely   reflecting unseasonably cool and wet weather; widespread flooding along the   Mississippi River hampered agricultural production in the Atlanta and St. Louis   Districts. In the Dallas District, in contrast, drought conditions hurt the   wheat crop and led to broader damage from wildfires. The energy industry showed   continued strength, with robust expansion in oil drilling and extraction   activity.
Labor market conditions continued to improve gradually across most of the   nation, with a number of Districts noting a short supply of workers with   specialized technical skills. Wage growth generally remained modest, though   there were scattered reports of steeper increases for highly skilled workers in   certain occupations. Most Districts continued to report widespread increases in   commodity prices; manufacturers are said to be passing along a portion of the   higher costs in the form of price hikes and fuel surcharges.
Consumer spending was   generally described as steady to up modestly since the last report, with most   Districts indicating small increases from a year ago. Non-auto retail sales were   indicated to be expanding steadily in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis,   Kansas City and Dallas Districts, while sales were characterized as stable or   decelerating in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco   Districts. Sales were reported to have declined in the Richmond District, and   Boston described sales as mixed but generally down from a year earlier. Retail   inventories were generally said to be at satisfactory levels, though St. Louis   characterized inventory levels as being on the high side. A number of Districts   noted that a combination of unfavorable weather and high fuel and food prices   have weighed on consumer spending in recent weeks. Cleveland and San Francisco   noted increased spending on discretionary items, and Philadelphia indicated that   some luxury goods retailers fared relatively well. On the other hand, Chicago   reported a decline in discretionary spending.
Most Districts reporting on vehicle sales indicated that they have been   steady to stronger since the last report, specifically Richmond, Chicago, St.   Louis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco. In addition, Atlanta noted firm   demand for automobiles. On the other hand, some softening in car sales was noted   in the northeastern Districts of New York, Philadelphia and Cleveland. Many   Districts indicated that supply disruptions, primarily from Japan, have   contributed to lean inventories, which have impeded auto sales somewhat. There   has also been widespread tightening in the market for used cars, reflecting both   strong demand and a shortage of inventory. Shifts in consumer demand toward   smaller, more fuel efficient cars were noted in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and   Chicago Districts, while St. Louis mentioned a shift from higher-end to   lower-end models.
Tourism activity has generally strengthened since the last report, and the   outlook for the summer season looks positive. Improvement in this sector was   reported in the Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts; in   addition, New York reported that tourism increased in April but appeared to edge   back in early May. Dallas maintained that travel activity has been mixed, while   Minneapolis indicated that tourism has been slow recently due to adverse   weather, but that inquiries and advance bookings for the summer season look   strong. St. Louis noted that flooding forced the temporary closure of numerous   casinos along the Mississippi River.
Activity in the non-financial   service sectors continued to strengthen in most Districts, with the notable   exception of St. Louis, which reported fairly widespread declines. Service   sector activity generally expanded in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia,   Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City and Dallas Districts, though Richmond noted   deceleration in the pace of growth. There were also pockets of strength in   particular sectors. Information technology firms saw activity expand in the   Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.   Employment agencies in the Boston and Chicago Districts indicated continued   improvement in activity, while New York and Dallas reported some slowing in this   industry. New York, Richmond and Minneapolis cited strengthening in business and   professional services, while San Francisco indicated steady to mixed activity in   this sector.
Activity in the transportation sector improved in the Cleveland, Atlanta,   Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Philadelphia and Richmond noted some slowing   in growth, and New York reported steady shipping activity, while San Francisco   indicated a slowdown in cargo traffic at Southern California seaports. Dallas   also reported weakening in container trade volumes but noted increases in cargo   volume, railroad shipments and small parcel shipments.
Manufacturing activity was reported as   continuing to increase since the last report in all but two districts, although   many noted that the pace of growth had slowed. The Boston, Atlanta, St. Louis,   Minneapolis, and San Francisco, Districts reported that activity expanded, and   the Dallas District reported a pickup in demand; the Philadelphia, Richmond,   Chicago, and Kansas City Districts reported that activity expanded but at a   slower pace, while activity was reported as steady in the New York District and   stable to growing in the Cleveland District. Supply disruptions related to the   earthquake in Japan led to reduced production of automobiles and auto parts in   several Districts. The Cleveland District noted a sharp drop in auto production,   the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts also saw production fall, and auto   deliveries were reported as having declined in the Richmond District. The   Atlanta District said lost production in its region would be made up later in   the year. Contacts in the Chicago District said that contingency plans to deal   with supply disruptions were helpful in mitigating the effects. High-tech firms   in the Boston and Dallas Districts reported that shortages of parts, due to   disruptions in Japan, had adverse effects on business; in contrast, there were   few supply constraints that affected technology-related products in the San   Francisco District.
Growth was reported as strong for semiconductors in the San Francisco and   Boston Districts. The Cleveland District reported that steel producers were   seeing shipping volumes level off after a strong first quarter performance, and   the Chicago District noted a decline in second quarter orders for industrial   metals, although orders for the third quarter were coming in at a more positive   pace. A contact in the Richmond District said that demand for industrial metals   had leveled off. The Chicago District reported a decline in activity for   construction materials and household goods. Production remained strong for   makers of commercial aircraft and parts in the San Francisco District.
Looking forward, contacts in most districts were generally optimistic about   the outlook, although less so than the last report. The Cleveland District said   that the majority of manufacturing contacts maintained a favorable outlook,   although some are delaying the start of capital projects. Contacts were   generally cautiously optimistic in the Boston District, although some expect   sales growth to moderate. Contacts were mostly positive about the outlook in the   Philadelphia District, though the level of optimism was not quite as strong as   in the last report. Chicago District contacts expect conditions to rebound in   the coming months. A majority of contacts in the Atlanta District planned to   increase production.
Residential real estate   sales markets showed continued weakness in most Districts, while rental markets   strengthened. Most Districts indicate that home prices have declined since the   last report: Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San   Francisco all report some downward drift in selling prices, while reports from   the New York and Cleveland Districts indicate that prices have been steady, on   balance. No district indicates a general increase in home prices. Sales   activity, though widely reported to be at low levels, picked up somewhat in the   Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Dallas indicated that   improved traffic has raised prospects of improved sales in the second half of   2011, and Boston observed signs that the market is stabilizing. Sales activity   was characterized as mostly steady in the New York, Cleveland, Dallas and San   Francisco Districts, but declining in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts.   Those Districts reporting on the residential rental market--specifically, New   York, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco--all indicate   that conditions have strengthened. In terms of residential construction,   activity has remained generally depressed, with a number of Districts reporting   a large overhang of distressed properties. However, a number of Districts--New   York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco--report improved prospects   for development of multi-family rental properties.
Commercial and industrial real estate markets have generally been steady   since the last report, though there have been scattered signs of a pickup.   Commercial leasing markets showed modest signs of improvement in the Richmond   and San Francisco Districts. Boston and Dallas noted some firming in property   sales markets, but Kansas City reported declines in prices for office buildings.   Non-residential construction, though widely reported to be at very low levels,   rose modestly in the Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts, though   Chicago noted that public sector projects are becoming smaller. Cleveland   observed a pickup in industrial and high-end commercial development but a   pullback in healthcare-related projects. Richmond reported some pockets of   strength in the retail market. More broadly, contacts in a number of Districts   expressed a general sense of optimism about the outlook for the second half of   2011.
Most Districts described loan demand   as mixed or slightly improved since the last report. Consumer loan demand showed   some improvement in the Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts, but held   steady or weakened in the New York, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco   Districts. Demand for residential mortgages (including new purchases and   refinances) increased in Cleveland but held steady in New York, Richmond, St.   Louis, and Kansas City. Contacts in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond,   Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted a modest uptick in   business loan demand. The increase in business loan demand in Cleveland was   described as broad-based, including a pickup in construction loan requests for   multi-family dwellings. Boston noted an improved lending environment for   commercial real estate, and demand for commercial mortgages increased in New   York and Dallas. Commercial and industrial loan activity increased in Richmond,   Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco, held steady in New York, and   decreased in Kansas City. Outside of banking, Chicago and San Francisco   indicated increased investment activity by hedge funds, venture capital firms,   and other forms of private equity.
Credit standards were reported to be mixed but, on balance, a bit easier in   recent weeks. New York, Cleveland, and Atlanta noted increased credit   availability for automobile loans; Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco   indicated easier credit for some types of business loans. Boston reported some   easing in commercial real estate lending, but New York reported tighter   standards in that segment. Credit standards on home mortgage loans tightened   somewhat in the St. Louis District. A number of Districts noted improvements in   overall credit quality: specifically, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas   City, Dallas, and San Francisco. New York indicated rising delinquency rates on   consumer loans but declining rates on commercial loans and mortgages.
Agriculture conditions   were unfavorable in many districts, with various weather related difficulties   leading to delays and below-average plantings of key crops. Excess precipitation   and cool temperatures delayed the planting of corn, soybeans, and other crops in   the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City   Districts, although Richmond reported that some parts of its District benefited   from favorable weather conditions. Cool temperatures also delayed the   development of some crops in the San Francisco District. Flooding on the   Mississippi River slowed activity for farmers in the St. Louis and Atlanta   Districts. The Dallas District reported that drought conditions had become   severe and that the wheat crop was expected to be particularly poor; wildfires   also led to significant agricultural losses in its District. Commodity prices   were reported as strong in the Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts, but were down   in the Chicago District. Hog prices were higher in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and   Kansas City Districts, while cattle prices were reported as lower in the Chicago   and Kansas City Districts but higher in the Minneapolis and Atlanta   Districts.
Activity in the energy industry remained robust. Drilling activity was   reported as strong and growing in the Dallas District, and work is being   re-permitted in the Gulf of Mexico. The San Francisco District reported that oil   extraction activity grew strongly in response to rising demand overseas, and   that the demand for natural gas continued to expand. In the Minneapolis   District, oil exploration activity increased. Contacts reported an increase in   drilling activity in the Kansas City District, although shortages of equipment   and labor created some drilling constraints. The St. Louis District reported   that coal production was modestly lower.
Most Districts reported   gradual improvement in labor market conditions since their last reports. Boston,   New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas all   noted general improvement in employment conditions, while job growth was mostly   limited to the manufacturing sector in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts.   Demand for permanent and temporary-to-permanent hiring increased in the Boston,   Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. While labor was generally available,   contacts in the Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San   Francisco Districts indicated that labor market conditions have tightened for   workers with specialized technical skills, particularly in the healthcare and   technology sectors. Despite signs of continued modest improvement in most labor   markets, Minneapolis noted several examples of expected layoffs and St. Louis   reported plans for layoffs in the District's services sector.
Wage pressures were reported to be largely contained in most Districts, as   abundant labor availability has continued to limit the pace of wage growth.   Modest wage pressures were reported in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago,   Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts, while wages were   reported as steady in New York and Philadelphia. However, contacts in the   Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts noted that wage   increases have been more significant for some highly skilled workers in   occupations with labor shortages. Firms' expectations for labor and benefits   costs moderated slightly in Atlanta.
Input prices continued to increase in most Districts, particularly for   agricultural commodities, petroleum-based products, and industrial metals,   although the pace of growth slowed in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts. In   addition, several Districts reported that fuel surcharges have increased or   become more widely used since the last report. While Boston indicated that firms   were able to pass along most input price increases into selling prices, contacts   in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas   City, Dallas, and San Francisco noted only a limited ability to pass through   these cost increases to their customers, with manufacturers generally being more   successful than retail or construction firms. In general, selling prices   increased only modestly, except for food and energy prices, which continued to   escalate. In addition, low inventory levels contributed to price increases for   used cars in the New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts.   Plans to implement future increases in selling prices were reported in the   Boston, New York, Chicago, and Dallas Districts.
