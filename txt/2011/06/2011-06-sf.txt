Twelfth District economic activity continued to expand at a moderate pace   during the reporting period of late April through the end of May. Price   increases for final goods and services remained limited, and upward pressures on   wages were subdued on balance. Sales of retail items rose further, while demand   for business and consumer services was mixed. District manufacturing activity   also was mixed but appeared to expand overall. Agricultural producers reported   strong sales, and extraction activity rose for providers of natural resources   used for energy production. Activity in District housing markets remained   lackluster, while demand for commercial real estate showed signs of improvement.   Contacts from financial institutions reported further increases in loan   demand.
Upward wage pressures were quite modest in general. Although hiring activity   has picked up, high unemployment and ample labor availability continued to limit   the pace of overall compensation gains throughout the District. The primary   exception continued to be workers with specialized technical skills,   particularly engineers and specialists in information technology, for whom wage   gains remained significant in several parts of the District.
Demand for business and consumer services was mixed. Providers of   professional services such as legal and accounting reported little change in   activity since the prior reporting period. Sales growth remained strong in the   Internet and digital media sectors, and demand for electricity by businesses and   households expanded further. Activity waned somewhat for providers of   transportation services, with contacts noting a slowdown in cargo traffic at   Southern California seaports. Health-care providers noted further moderation in   the demand for their services. Travel activity continued to improve in much of   the District, reflecting growth in business travel as well as tourism.
