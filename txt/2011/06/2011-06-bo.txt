Many business contacts in the First District report improving economic   conditions. Firms in manufacturing, software and information technology, and   staffing services cite ongoing increases in demand, with manufacturers reporting   the most strength. Commercial real estate markets are improving modestly, retail   reports are mixed, and residential real estate markets remain weak. Both   retailers and manufacturers report input cost increases, which they are   generally passing along to customers. Labor markets, by contrast, are seeing   some net hiring, but wage increases remain subdued. Outlooks remain generally   optimistic, although cautious.
Inventory levels are mixed, with one retailer explaining inventory has been   temporarily increased due to global supply concerns, such as output disruptions   in Japan. Contacts note steep price increases for commodities, including cotton,   dairy, grains, meat, produce, and nuts; they are passing along price increases   where possible. Headcount changes are mixed, as some firms add people in line   with new store openings and select hiring opportunities, while one has cut jobs   and anticipates outsourcing select positions. Capital spending is mixed.   Outlooks range from concerned to cautiously optimistic.
Commodity prices continue to be a concern for manufacturers whose production   inputs include petroleum or gas-related products and/or firms that use a lot of   metals such as steel. Most of the affected companies have already raised prices   with little push-back from their customers, and a number of them plan to   implement further price hikes this summer. By contrast, a pharmaceutical company   with overseas sales notes downward pressure on their selling prices to   government health care systems in Europe, which they attribute to ongoing fiscal   imbalances across the Euro-area and related interventions to reduce costs and   government debt. Some firms still report modest supply chain disruptions because   of the earthquake in Japan (mostly semiconductor-related and other high tech   inputs) or worldwide demand-related shortages of selected petroleum-related   products. However, one affected firm notes that supply conditions have improved   slightly recently and others say they continue to make adjustments to avoid a   big impact on their production or sales.
The employment situation at surveyed manufacturers continues to be relatively   stable, as many continue to try to increase output using existing workers. A   semiconductor firm notes that the cost of this year's merit raises will be   offset through other productivity gains, so the overall cost impact is   negligible. Those firms that are hiring are doing so at a relatively moderate   rate to meet increased demand for existing or new products. In particular, some   pharmaceutical companies plan to meet increased demand by increasing their   headcounts between 5 percent and 10 percent. Much of the hiring and investment   at contacted firms is occurring overseas as they look to expand their   operations, especially in Asia. Most respondents have already or plan to   institute merit increases for their employees in 2011, ranging between 2 percent   and 5 percent, which they note are a little lower than before the recent   recession.
Capital spending at most contacted manufacturers continues to be in line with   previous years. A few companies, however, are investing more in order to adjust   their capacity to meet increased demand. Overall, the outlook for the contacted   firms is favorable and most respondents seem somewhat more upbeat than at the   beginning of this year.
Contacts throughout the region expect year-over-year declines to continue for   the next few months because of last year's homebuyer tax credit. Although   several contacts believe that much of the New England real estate market has   begun stabilizing, they caution that a lengthy recovery still remains.
