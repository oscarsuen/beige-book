The pace of economic activity in the Seventh District moderated in October   and early November. While contacts generally were cautiously optimistic about   the economic outlook, many also expressed concern over the increasingly risk   adverse business environment. Consumer spending increased, while business   spending was steady. Manufacturing production also increased, with growth   leveling off over the reporting period. Construction was again subdued, although   nonresidential construction increased slightly. Credit conditions were little   changed. Wholesale price increases slowed, but there was some further   pass-through to the retail level. Corn, soybean, and cattle prices were up from   early October, while milk and hog prices were down.
