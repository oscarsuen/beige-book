Business activity in the Fourth District expanded at a modest pace since our   last report. Manufacturers reported that new orders and production were stable.   Single-family home building remained sluggish, while construction of   multi-family housing rose. Inquiries to nonresidential builders picked up some,   but backlogs are still low. Retail sales increased slightly. Auto dealers   described sales of new and used vehicles as very good. Shale gas drilling and   production continued to expand. Freight transport volume was stable. The demand   for business credit grew moderately, while consumer loan demand was weak.
Hiring remains at a low level across almost all industry sectors.   Staffing-firm representatives reported modest growth in the number of new job   openings and placements, with vacancies concentrated in professional business   services and energy. Wage pressures are contained. Respondents noted some upward   pressure on prices, especially for metals and petroleum-based products.
New orders and production at District   factories were stable along seasonal trends during the past six weeks. Compared   to year-ago levels, output was mainly higher. Most of our contacts are cautious   in their outlook but expect little change in demand during the upcoming months.   Steel producers and service centers reported that shipping volume was steady or   slightly lower, with demand being driven by energy and industrial equipment   industries. Steel representatives remain hopeful that current volume can be   maintained, although some seasonal slowing is expected. District auto production   held steady in October on a month-over-month basis. Compared to year-ago levels,   output rose moderately, more so for domestic nameplates.
Manufacturers remain committed to their capital spending plans, with many   steel companies expecting to increase outlays during the upcoming months.   Capacity utilization remains below normal at most factories, while steel   producers saw their utilization rates at or near normal levels. Inventories are   in line with sales for a majority of our contacts. Reports on raw materials   prices were mixed. Half of our respondents said that prices were steady or   declining; others told us that prices continue to rise, but at a slower rate   than earlier in the year. Increases were mainly associated with metals and   petroleum-based products. Changes in raw materials prices were passed through to   customers. New hiring remains at a low level. Those adding to payrolls found it   difficult to recruit highly skilled workers. Wage pressures are contained.
Single-family home construction remained   sluggish, while activity in multi-family housing and remodeling expanded. Sales   contracts were mainly in the move-up price-point categories. Several builders   reported that difficulty in obtaining financing is preventing them from adding   to their spec inventory. Little change is expected in residential building for   the next one to two years. Not much difference was seen in the list prices or   discounting of new houses since our last report. The pickup in hiring by general   contractors that occurred late in the summer has diminished.
Activity in nonresidential construction for small to medium-size builders was   described as steady or slowly improving. While the number of inquiries has   picked up recently, the biggest challenge facing builders at this time is adding   backlog. One contractor commented that the incubation period for public   infrastructure projects can be as long as five years. Construction contracts   were primarily in education, manufacturing, energy, and research and   development. Looking forward, builders expect modest growth at best during the   next six months. We heard several reports of upward pressure on prices for   copper and steel, though the price of lumber declined. Construction managers are   in the process of laying off seasonal workers.
Retailers saw a slight improvement in   sales during October, when compared to September's results, with several of our   contacts noting a pickup in purchases of cold-weather-related items and home   furnishings. Transactions were also ahead of last year's levels, mainly in the   mid-single digits. Looking ahead to the holiday shopping season, retailers   expect stronger sales on a year-over-year basis. We continued to hear numerous   reports about upward pressure on supplier costs, particularly for packaging,   fuel, and agricultural commodities. A few retailers reported that suppliers have   held off passing through the entire price increase, but they may be less   reluctant to do so in 2012. Retailers were also selective about passing through   rising prices to consumers. Reports on profit margins were mixed. Capital   budgets remain on plan. Most of our contacts said that outlays during 2012 will   not change appreciably from this year's levels, and that they will be used   mainly for technology enhancements, e-commerce investments, and remodeling.   Little change in payrolls is expected at existing stores. Seasonal hiring at   some stores will be slightly higher than in 2010.
Auto dealers characterized new-vehicle sales during October as very good,   with most of our contacts reporting higher sales volume when compared to   year-ago levels. Demand was strongest for fuel-efficient, less-expensive cars,   and crossover vehicles. Inventories continue to be rebuilt but remain below what   dealers would like. Dealers are cautious in their outlook due to uncertainty   about the economy, and the availability of vehicles that consumers want to buy.   Demand for used cars is up substantially since the beginning of October; prices   remain elevated. Two dealers noted that there has been a sharp increase in   manufacturers' incentives, which they attributed to the model-year changeover.   The few dealers looking to hire reported that it is difficult to find qualified   candidates, especially sales representatives and service technicians.
Demand for business loans showed a moderate   improvement, although a few community bankers observed some weakening. Requests   are being driven by energy, manufacturing, multi-family housing, and healthcare.   Reports indicate continued downward pressure on interest rates for commercial   credit. On the consumer side, our contacts described installment loan activity   as flat or down; however, direct and indirect auto lending continued to show   strength. Interest rates remain very competitive. Activity in the residential   mortgage market has slowed since our last report, with most applicants looking   to refinance. Many bankers noted a pickup in the number of applicants who are   refinancing into 15-year mortgages. No changes were made to loan application   standards. Overall core deposits continue to grow, although several bankers   reported that the growth is being driven by business customers. Delinquencies   were steady or declined across loan categories; any stress was mainly on the   consumer side. Payrolls were stable, with little hiring expected in the   near-term.
Conventional oil and natural gas production rose   moderately during the past six weeks, while drilling was little changed. Our   contacts were somewhat uncertain about future activity due to falling prices for   natural gas. Well-head prices for oil were fairly stable. Activity in shale-gas   extraction continued to expand. One report characterized production from   confirmation wells drilled in Ohio's Utica shale as good. Coal output is   expected to be stable for the remainder of this year, though increases are   possible in 2012 as a result of growing demand from export markets and domestic   utilities. There is some uncertainty surrounding utility demand due to abundant   supplies of low-priced natural gas and regulatory compliance issues for   coal-fired generators. Spot prices for coal showed normal fluctuations. Capital   outlays are on target, with moderate increases projected by oil and gas   companies in the upcoming months. The cost of production equipment and materials   was flat during the past six weeks. Energy payrolls held steady.
On balance, freight transport volume was   stable over the past six weeks and up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Rising   demand was seen from the retail and energy (shale gas and coal) sectors. Our   contacts expect volume to grow at a slow, steady pace in the near term. We heard   numerous reports of rising prices for tires, parts, and equipment, and of some   volatility in fuel prices. Much of the cost increase was recovered via fuel   surcharges and rate adjustments when contracts came due. Capital outlays have   accelerated during 2011 relative to prior-year levels. Spending is mainly to   replace aging equipment and to support demand growth, especially from energy   customers. All of our contacts reported hiring for driver replacement or adding   capacity, although recruiting qualified drivers was difficult. Wage pressures   are emerging due to a tightening of the driver pool.
