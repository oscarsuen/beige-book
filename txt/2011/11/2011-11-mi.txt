The Ninth District economy grew moderately since the last report. Strong   growth was reported in the agriculture, energy and mining sectors. Modest to   moderate growth was noted in consumer spending, tourism, residential and   commercial construction, residential real estate and professional services.   Activity in commercial real estate was flat, while manufacturing was mixed.   Labor markets showed some signs of tightening, while wage increases remained   moderate. Prices generally were level. Consumer Spending and Tourism Consumer spending grew   moderately. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in   October increased about 3 percent compared with a year earlier. A Minneapolis   area mall reported that recent sales were up between 3 percent and 5 percent, as   cooler weather inspired shoppers to buy fall goods. According to the University   of St. Thomas Holiday Spending Sentiment Survey, Minneapolis-St. Paul households   are predicted to spend 3.4 percent more on holiday gifts than last year. Auto   sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area increased since the last report,   according to a domestic auto dealer. However, a Minnesota-based clothing   retailer announced plans to close several stores and reduce its workforce.   Preliminary results of the Minneapolis Fed's business outlook poll indicated   that respondents expect slight increases in consumer spending in their   communities and increased sales of their businesses' products and services. Tourism activity was up from a year ago. According to officials, momentum   from a very good summer tourism season in Montana continued into the fall.   Occupancy at Minnesota's hotels and motels increased almost 5 percent during the   third quarter compared with a year ago. Construction and Real Estate Commercial construction   activity increased modestly since the last report. Respondents to a November   Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey of commercial construction contacts reported an   increase in construction activity for health care facilities and industrial   buildings. However, the value of commercial building permits in the Sioux Falls,   S.D., area was down slightly in October from October 2010. Residential   construction increased from last year. Several multifamily construction projects   were announced or are under construction in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The   number of permitted residential units in Minnesota was up in September from a   year ago. However, in the Sioux Falls area, the value of residential building   permits in October was level with the same period a year earlier. Commercial real estate markets were flat. Respondents to the Minneapolis   Fed's ad hoc survey noted flat revenues and profits over the past three months.   The commercial real estate sector is still very weak, particularly in office   space. "Very little expansion by companies, so the only activity seems to be   companies shopping for lower rates," commented a Minneapolis-St. Paul area   contact. Residential real estate markets grew. Home sales in October were up   significantly from the same period a year ago in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area,   while the inventory available for sale shrank. Services On balance, professional business services firms   expect increased activity. Based on results from the business outlook poll,   respondents from the services sector expect to increase sales and capital   investment in 2012. "Things generally are better," commented a Montana   professional services firm. Manufacturing Manufacturing activity was mixed since the   last report. An October survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University   (Omaha, Neb.) showed that production increased in Minnesota and North Dakota,   but unexpectedly contracted slightly in South Dakota. Bank Directors noted that   manufacturing was doing well with some equipment backlogs extending throughout   2012. Producers of storage bins for agricultural use reported strong demand.   However, a window maker announced that it will lay off workers due to weak home   construction. A large printing operation in Minnesota halted expansion plans due   to uncertainty about the economy. Energy and Mining The energy and mining sectors saw   continued strong growth. Oil exploration activity increased in Montana since the   last report, but decreased slightly in North Dakota. In North Dakota, regulators   approved plans for a 105-megawatt wind farm, and three other wind energy   projects are under review. A short line railroad reported that it saw strong   demand growth from the wind energy and oil drilling sectors. District mines   continued to operate at very high capacity utilization rates. Agriculture Agricultural conditions remained generally   strong. Farm financial conditions were very strong due to high commodity prices.   Prices for hogs, cattle, turkeys and eggs increased in October; prices for corn,   soybeans and wheat declined, but remain substantially above their year-earlier   levels. The harvest went quickly, thanks to recent dry weather. District corn   production was roughly even with 2010; however, soybean production was down more   than 12 percent. Wheat production was down dramatically in some areas of the   District. Employment, Wages, and Prices Labor markets showed some   signs of tightening. In a recent survey of Minnesota manufacturers, 45 percent   of respondents reported that skilled-worker shortages were a moderate or serious   problem, particularly for skilled production and IT workers. A Minnesota   recreational vehicle manufacturer reported that it isn't running a plant at   capacity because of a surprising shortage of workers. A representative of a   Minnesota employment services firm noted robust demand for temporary light   industrial positions during September and October; demand for permanent   positions was volatile. A South Dakota manufacturer reported difficulty finding   qualified workers in order to expand operations. In Montana, a job fair   indicated that employers were recruiting recent college graduates with   engineering, business and computer science majors. According to the business   outlook poll, 36 percent of respondents consider securing workers a challenge or   serious challenge in 2012, up from 24 percent in last year's poll. Wage increases were moderate. Members of a South Dakota county highway union   recently agreed to a 5 percent pay cut in 2012. The business outlook poll shows   that 96 percent of respondents expect wages and salaries in their communities to   increase no more than 3 percent. However, some fast food restaurants in western   North Dakota were offering wages as high as $15 per hour to attract   employees. Prices generally remained level, although some exceptions were noted.   Minnesota gasoline prices continued to decrease since the last report, but were   still 54 cents per gallon higher than a year ago. Meanwhile, a South Dakota   manufacturer noted that steel prices have softened recently. According to   respondents to the business outlook poll, 41 percent expect to increase prices   for their businesses' products and services in 2012, up from 35 percent last   year.
