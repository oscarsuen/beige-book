The Tenth District economy expanded modestly in late July and early August.   Consumer spending edged up with solid back-to-school shopping and stronger than   expected auto sales. Led by durable goods production, District manufacturing   activity grew slightly, with expectations for stronger activity over the coming   months. Despite solid multi-family building activity, residential and commercial   construction remained weak. District drilling activity expanded further in July   and August with expectations of a seasonal rise in energy prices heading into   the winter. Rising input costs and extreme weather trimmed farm profits, and   farm capital spending slowed. District bankers reported further improvements in   loan quality amid weaker loan demand, while a flight-to-quality boosted bank   deposits. Inflationary pressures softened in the District as fewer retailers and   manufacturers expected to raise prices in coming months. Wage pressures were   confined to high-skilled positions, despite District unemployment rates well   below national levels. Consumer Spending Consumer spending rose modestly in late   July and early August and was expected to remain solid in the months ahead.   District retailers reported higher than expected sales and were somewhat   optimistic about future business activity. Apparel and accessory items sold well   during the back-to-school shopping season, but demand remained sluggish for   large-ticket household items and appliances. Auto dealers reported strong sales,   especially for new and used economy cars. Auto sales were expected to increase   with the introduction of the new model year, and some dealerships were hiring   salespeople and service technicians. Restaurants remained busy as total sales   increased despite smaller average check amounts. After improving during the last   survey period, travel and tourism activity generally held steady through the   summer vacation season. District hotel owners reported increased occupancy at   slightly lower average room rates. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Manufacturing   and high-tech service activity expanded slightly during the survey period, while   transportation activity edged down. Manufacturing activity expanded at durable   goods factories, particularly those producing machinery and electronic products,   offsetting weakness at non-durable goods plants. The volume of new orders dipped   in July, rebounded in August, and was expected to remain solid during the next   six months. Shipment volumes held relatively steady, and order backlogs improved   with a slight drop in finished goods inventories. With increased activity,   durable goods manufacturers hired additional workers, while non-durable goods   factories reduced worker hours. After softening earlier in the summer, capital   spending was expected to strengthen in coming months. The high-tech industry   reported a modest increase in sales, but contacts were concerned that economic   uncertainty could dampen demand. Following steady growth during the last few   months, activity in the transportation sector dipped below expectations, and   firms remained concerned about high fuel costs and a shortage of qualified   drivers. Real Estate and Construction Residential and commercial   real estate activity remained weak in late July and early August. Increased   buyer traffic and declining home prices did not spur significantly more   residential sales, and existing home inventories rose further. Several real   estate contacts thought that economic uncertainty was limiting potential home   buyer purchases despite low mortgage rates and reduced home prices. Residential   mortgage lenders reported fewer loans for home purchases but an increase in loan   refinancing activity. With more people staying in their current homes,   construction supply firms noted solid sales for remodeling projects. After an   early summer lull, some residential builders reported an uptick in building   starts. With the exception of multi-family building projects, new commercial   construction was very limited. Commercial real estate prices declined with   weaker sales. Yet, lower commercial rents helped trim vacancy rates at   commercial properties. District contacts expected commercial prices, rents and   vacancy rates to hold steady in coming months. Developers reported little change   in access to credit. Banking In the recent survey period, bankers reported   further improvements in loan quality and increased deposits amid somewhat weaker   loan demand. Compared to a year ago, loan quality improved with lower   delinquency rates, and bankers expected further improvements during the next six   months. Overall loan demand decreased slightly as demand for commercial real   estate loans declined, while demand for commercial and industrial loans,   residential real estate loans, and consumer installment loans held steady.   Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories.   Deposits increased for the fifth straight survey with a few bankers noting that   a flight-to-quality supported increased deposits. Bankers cited a weak and   uncertain economic recovery and financial regulation as factors shaping   expectations for the rest of the year. Agriculture Extreme weather and rising input costs   dampened farm income expectations since the last survey period. Drought   continued to stress crops in Kansas and accelerated feedlot placements in   Oklahoma due to poor pasture conditions. In contrast, most of the corn and   soybean crops in Nebraska were in good or better condition with isolated reports   of storm damage from high winds and hail. Farm capital spending waned as   producers paid higher prices for production inputs such as fuel, fertilizer, and   feed. Rising input costs strained profit margins, despite a modest rise in   commodity prices. Loan repayment rates eased with weaker farm income. Farmland   values rose further, but the pace of appreciation slowed. Energy Energy activity expanded further in late July and   early August, and additional gains were expected in the coming months. The   number of active drilling rigs in the District rose solidly as additional oil   rigs in Oklahoma and New Mexico more than offset a slight decline in Wyoming.   Wyoming producers noted that fewer drilling permits were being issued in the   Powder River Basin, and the approval process for additional permits was taking   longer. Several contacts reported that future drilling activity could be   constrained due to a lack of qualified labor, equipment and supplies, and to a   lesser degree, availability of financing. Some firms were offering higher wages   to retain and recruit engineers and skilled field operators. Crude oil prices   were expected to move higher due to strong global demand, but most producers   felt natural gas prices would hold steady until the winter heating season began.   District coal production increased in late July and early August, but remained   below year-ago levels. Ethanol prices and profits retreated from recent highs as   the industry increased production. Wages and Prices Inflationary pressures softened during   the last survey period as wage pressures remained low and fewer businesses   expected to raise prices over the coming months. Most industries did not plan to   raise wages, except for a few skilled positions, such as engineers, software   developers, mechanics, and truck drivers. After rising modestly during the past   survey period, fewer retailers expected to raise selling prices over the next   three months. Restaurateurs, however, expected further increases in menu prices   due to rising food costs. Fewer manufacturers reported price increases for raw   materials, and most did not plan to pass on higher costs to finished goods   prices. Builders and construction supply companies noted prices for construction   materials generally held steady, with the exception of higher prices for   petroleum-based products such as roofing shingles and asphalt. Transportation   companies continued to pay high fuel prices, and some were considering raising   rates.
