The Tenth District economy expanded modestly in late July and early August.   Consumer spending edged up with solid back-to-school shopping and stronger than   expected auto sales. Led by durable goods production, District manufacturing   activity grew slightly, with expectations for stronger activity over the coming   months. Despite solid multi-family building activity, residential and commercial   construction remained weak. District drilling activity expanded further in July   and August with expectations of a seasonal rise in energy prices heading into   the winter. Rising input costs and extreme weather trimmed farm profits, and   farm capital spending slowed. District bankers reported further improvements in   loan quality amid weaker loan demand, while a flight-to-quality boosted bank   deposits. Inflationary pressures softened in the District as fewer retailers and   manufacturers expected to raise prices in coming months. Wage pressures were   confined to high-skilled positions, despite District unemployment rates well   below national levels.
