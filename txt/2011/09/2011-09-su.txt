Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic   activity continued to expand at a modest pace, though some Districts noted mixed   or weakening activity. The St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San   Francisco Districts all reported either modest or slight expansion. Atlanta said   activity continued to expand at a very subdued pace, while Cleveland reported   slow growth and New York indicated growth remained sluggish. Economic activity   expanded more slowly in the Chicago District and slowed in the Richmond   District. Business activity in the Boston and Philadelphia Districts was   characterized as mixed, with Philadelphia adding that activity was somewhat   weaker overall. Several Districts also indicated that recent stock market   volatility and increased economic uncertainty had led many contacts to downgrade   or become more cautious about their near-term outlooks.
Consumer spending increased slightly in most Districts since the last survey,   but non-auto retail sales were flat or down in several Districts. Although poor   weather dampened growth in some areas, tourist activity remained solid in most   Districts. The demand for services was generally positive throughout the nation,   but one region said conditions were deteriorating. Of the five Districts   reporting on transportation, three said conditions were mostly positive, while   the other two reported activity as flat or slightly below expectations.   Manufacturing conditions were mixed across the country, but the pace of activity   slowed in many Districts. Residential real estate markets remained weak overall   with only a few slight improvements in some Districts. Most Districts   characterized commercial real estate and construction activity as weak or little   changed, but improvements were noted in several areas. Loan demand remained   stable or slightly weaker, and lending standards were largely unchanged with an   improvement in loan quality. Harsh summer weather negatively affected   agricultural activity, although recent rains in several Districts provided some   relief. Districts reporting on energy activity said it generally expanded, with   further growth expected.
Price pressures edged lower, although input costs continued to increase in   some industries and retail prices rose in several Districts. Labor markets were   generally stable, although some Districts reported modest employment growth.   Wage pressures were generally minimal outside of some upward movement for   skilled positions.
Overall consumer spending   increased slightly in most Districts, but non-auto retail sales were flat or   down in some Districts. Hurricane Irene evacuations also produced widespread   retail disruptions in late August in the New York District, where activity had   been close to or above plan in July before slowing somewhat in early August. The   Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts reported moderate increases in non-auto   retail sales during the survey period, and sales in the San Francisco District   were mixed but up slightly overall. Retail sales were up single-digits from a   year ago in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts, although Dallas reported no   growth in sales since the previous survey period. Retailers in the Chicago   District reported strong back to school sales, while Atlanta said growth slowed   in retail sales. The Boston and Philadelphia Districts said sales were flat to   down but with sizable variation across stores, while sales mostly weakened in   the Richmond and St. Louis Districts. Sales of apparel and luxury items were   characterized as strong in several Districts. The Boston, Chicago, Kansas City,   and San Francisco Districts all noted sluggish sales of big ticket household   items such as furniture and appliances, and contacts in several Districts   thought that heightened consumer anxiety was weighing on sales. Contacts in some   Districts continued to indicate profit margins were being squeezed by rising   input costs, although grocers in the Cleveland District were passing cost   increases through to customers.
Most Districts reporting on auto sales noted increases in activity, despite   lingering supply disruptions for some Japanese nameplates. The Kansas City and   Cleveland Districts reported especially strong sales of fuel-efficient cars,   while luxury vehicles sold well in the Minneapolis District. High demand for   used cars was reported in several Districts. The New York and Philadelphia   Districts reported somewhat softer auto sales in July, attributed in part to   continued supply disruptions, although sales firmed somewhat in August. Tight   vehicle supplies were noted in some Districts, and the San Francisco District   noted ongoing shortages of Japanese nameplates. Auto contacts in the Dallas   District believed the supply issues from Japanese manufacturers should be   resolved by the end of September. Auto dealers in several Districts were   optimistic about future sales, although contacts in the Philadelphia District   said uncertainty clouded the outlook. The Cleveland District noted some easing   in auto credit restrictions, and New York said both retail and wholesale auto   credit conditions were good.
Tourism activity remained solid in most Districts, although poor weather   affected growth in some areas. Travel activity was reported as robust in the   Atlanta District, especially for airport traffic in South Florida. Tourism in   the New York City area was also very strong prior to Hurricane Irene, and city   theaters planned to re-open the Monday morning after the hurricane. Both   business and leisure travel posted further improvement in the San Francisco   District, and tourism activity was solid overall in the Minneapolis District   despite heavy rains in Montana. By contrast, tourism activity slowed in July in   the Boston District, leading hotels to increase promotional offerings, and the   Long Island and Jersey Shore areas of the New York District as well as coastal   areas of the Richmond District were heavily affected by hurricane evacuations in   late August. Hotels in several Districts were raising room rates, although the   Kansas City District noted some easing.
Nonfinancial services activity   edged higher in most Districts, although Minneapolis and Dallas characterized   growth as flat or steady, and New York said conditions deteriorated. Richmond,   St. Louis, and San Francisco reported generally solid demand for health-care   services, although Richmond noted lower occupancies at senior care facilities   due to difficulties among potential residents in selling their homes. Software   and information technology firms in the Boston District reported mixed activity   since July but expected to return to previous strong growth patterns by late   2011. The San Francisco District reported expanded sales for technology service   providers due to heightened demand for software, e-books, and mobile   applications. In contrast, an information technology contact in the Minneapolis   District noted a decline in sales as a result of reduced demand from the   government and financial services sectors.
In transportation services, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas reported mostly   positive conditions, while activity was flat in the San Francisco District and   below expectations in the Kansas City District. Railroad shipments rose slightly   in the Dallas District, with particularly strong volume growth in metallic ores,   petroleum products, and non-commercial building products. Cleveland noted an   acceleration in capital spending, mainly to replace aging equipment and support   demand growth from energy customers. Trucking firms in the Cleveland, Atlanta,   and Kansas City Districts reported a shortage of qualified drivers, and a few   firms noted concerns about higher fuel costs. Many services contacts expressed   substantial uncertainty about future business activity, with a few Districts   reporting weakened outlooks for transportation.
Manufacturing conditions were mixed across   the country, but the pace of activity slowed in many Districts. The New York,   Philadelphia, and Richmond Districts reported declining activity overall, and   contacts in the Boston and Dallas Districts noted slowing demand from European   customers. Cleveland said factory production was stable, and manufacturing   activity in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts grew at a slower pace.   Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco reported slight expansions, and St.   Louis said activity continued to increase and that several manufacturers planned   to open plants and expand operations in the near future. Most manufacturing   contacts were less optimistic than in the previous survey; however, future   capital spending plans were solid in a few Districts.
Looking across factory sectors, auto production decreased in the Cleveland   District due to normal seasonal retooling for model changeovers, and the Chicago   District said auto production leveled off in August after a strong July. Textile   manufacturers in the Richmond District said markets have grown weaker due to   declining consumer confidence. Construction-related manufacturing was   characterized as weak in the Dallas and Philadelphia Districts, and Boston noted   a cyclical decline in semiconductor demand. Philadelphia reported a decline in   food manufacturing, and the Kansas City District noted weakness at nondurable   goods plants. In contrast, commercial aircraft manufacturers in the San   Francisco District reported solid production rates due to new orders for   narrow-body aircraft and a growing order backlog. A metal fabricator in the   Minneapolis District announced plans to expand a facility in northwestern   Montana. Capacity utilization in the steel industry remained at record high   levels in the Chicago District, and a tire manufacturer in the Atlanta District   noted particular pressure in meeting a recent surge in new orders due to supply   chain normalization after the Japan disaster.
Residential real estate   activity remained weak overall, although a few Districts noted some slight   improvements. Contacts in the Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts   reported an increase in home sales over the previous year's weak levels;   however, the uptick in the Atlanta District was concentrated mainly in Florida.   The remaining Districts all reported stable or slower sales from the previous   survey period, with several citing greater economic uncertainty as the primary   cause. Both the New York and Philadelphia Districts reported that a growing   backlog of foreclosures in New Jersey continued to weigh down the housing   market. Home construction was down or stagnant in most Districts, with the   exception of Minneapolis and Kansas City. However, several Districts indicated   an improvement in home remodeling activity, and the New York, Philadelphia, and   Cleveland Districts reported increased demand for multi-family housing projects.   Home prices were flat to slightly down in several Districts, although New York   said prices in many areas edged higher but remained below year-ago levels.   Contacts in the Boston District reported competitive pricing by sellers with   even lower prices negotiated by buyers, but in the Cleveland District many   builders have shifted away from discounting. Inventories were elevated or rising   in the Boston, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts, particularly for existing   homes, and demand for apartment rental space increased in the San Francisco and   Dallas Districts.
Commercial real estate conditions remained weak or little changed in most   Districts, although some improvements were noted by New York, Minneapolis, and   Dallas. Commercial real estate activity was sluggish in the Boston, Cleveland,   Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. However, San   Francisco noted some areas have benefited from technology sector growth, and   Boston noted investor demand for prime office buildings remained strong. New   York said office vacancy rates declined noticeably in the Buffalo and Rochester   metro areas and modestly in Manhattan and Long Island. Lower commercial rents   helped push down vacancy rates in the Kansas City District, and the Dallas   District noted strong demand for leased space in Houston due to solid energy   activity. Commercial construction was characterized as weak or limited by   Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City, although Atlanta noted some   strength in the healthcare sector. St. Louis described conditions as mixed, with   some improvement in education and energy-related construction, while Minneapolis   District contacts reported an increase in small retrofitting projects and   rebuilding in flood-damaged areas. The Chicago District noted continued strength   in industrial construction, particularly in the automotive sector. Credit for   commercial development remained an obstacle for small retailers in the Richmond   District, although Boston said aggressive competition among lenders led to   reduced borrowing rates.
Most districts cited overall loan   demand as stable to slightly weaker, with the exception of St. Louis, which   reported a modest increase. Demand for business loans remained unchanged or   weakened in the New York, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, but   was moderately stronger in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis Districts.   Demand for consumer loans increased somewhat in the St. Louis District, but was   unchanged to slightly weaker in the New York, Kansas City, and San Francisco   Districts. While Kansas City reported a decline in commercial real estate loans,   St. Louis cited a modest increase. New York and Cleveland noted increased demand   for residential mortgages.
Most Districts said that loan quality was generally improving and that credit   standards were largely unchanged. Cleveland reported a decline in delinquencies   across all loan categories, and Richmond and Kansas City also indicated a   continued strengthening in loan quality. However, New York indicated that   delinquency rates increased on most categories of loans and that banks tightened   standards for commercial mortgages and commercial and industrial loans. Banking   contacts in several Districts also referenced concerns about the economy. The   Chicago District cited recent volatility in financial markets and reduced   expectations for economic growth, while Kansas City District contacts listed a   weak economic recovery and uncertainty about financial regulations.
Harsh summer weather   strained agricultural activity in many Districts since the last survey period.   Hot, dry weather stressed crops and livestock in the Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas   City, and Dallas Districts, with poor pasture conditions hastening herd   liquidations in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Recent rains provided some   relief to agricultural producers in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, but   Hurricane Irene caused extensive damage to field crops not yet harvested in   North Carolina. Shrinking production estimates pushed up crop prices and the   Chicago District noted that robust ethanol production was also driving corn   prices higher. Crop and livestock sales rose in the San Francisco District, and   the Dallas District reported strong beef exports. Farmland values rose further   in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts, but rising input costs trimmed farm   capital spending in the Kansas City District.
Energy activity generally expanded since the last survey period, with   additional gains expected in coming months. The Minneapolis, Kansas City, and   Dallas Districts reported an increase in land-based oil drilling activity, and   the Atlanta and Dallas Districts reported a modest rise in off-shore drilling   operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas exploration rose in the Cleveland   District, and remained steady in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts.   Additional capital investments in oil and gas production were expected in the   Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts. Energy contacts in the Cleveland   and Kansas City Districts noted some new hiring, although permit delays and   environmental compliance could constrain expansion. Coal production rose in the   Kansas City District, held steady in the Cleveland District, and fell in the St.   Louis District. Higher metals prices spurred mining activity in the Minneapolis   and San Francisco Districts, especially for iron ore.
Labor markets were   generally steady, although some Districts reported modest employment growth.   Several Districts reported a shortage of skilled workers such as engineers,   mechanics, and software developers. Jobs in the health care industry continued   to increase, and the Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts   indicated growth in energy-related employment. Many Districts reported an   increase in auto sales and service technician positions, and several companies   in the Minneapolis District announced new manufacturing jobs. The Atlanta   District noted that many contacts were focused on productivity and efficiency   increases with existing staff, and Richmond said one firm would rather pay   overtime than hire new workers. A large staffing firm in Chicago reported a   decline in billable hours for staffing and professional services as well as   fewer permanent placements, while Boston said demand for permanent and   temporary-to-permanent hiring continued to grow. A major New York City   employment agency reported unusually slow hiring activity in August but remained   cautiously optimistic about future recruitment. Most Districts reported that   wage pressures were minimal, but contacts noted some wage gains for several   skilled positions as a result of heightened demand.
The majority of Districts reported fewer price pressures, but input costs   continued to rise in select industries. The New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland,   and San Francisco Districts noted some stabilization or decline in raw materials   prices but Chicago said elevated commodity prices continued to put pressure on   costs, particularly copper and steel. Manufacturers in the Boston District were   able to pass through input price increases with little resistance, although a   semiconductor firm was one exception. The Kansas City District reported   construction materials prices as steady, excluding prices of petroleum-based   products such as roofing shingles and asphalt, which continued to rise. Retail   prices were steady or rising slightly in New York, Richmond, and Atlanta,   although some Atlanta District retailers mentioned that weak sales could prompt   them to lower prices. Retailers in the Dallas District noted a slight decline in   overall prices, although increases were observed in certain high-end goods and   cotton-based products. Prices for cotton-based products, such as clothing, also   increased in the San Francisco and Cleveland Districts. Food prices climbed   higher in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, and restaurants in the Kansas   City District expected further increases in menu prices as a result of rising   food costs.
