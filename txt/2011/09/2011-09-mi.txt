The Ninth District economy has grown slightly since the last report.   Increased activity was noted in consumer spending, tourism, residential and   commercial construction, residential real estate, manufacturing, energy and   mining. Crop reports were mostly down from last year, but several District   agricultural prices have risen recently. Activity in commercial real estate and   professional services was flat overall. Reports from labor markets include a mix   of layoffs and new hiring, while wage increases remain moderate. Price increases   were generally modest.
Consumer spending increased   moderately. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in   July increased over 4 percent compared with a year earlier. Two Minnesota   restaurant and bar chains reported that recent sales were up modestly from last   year. A North Dakota mall manager reported that sales and traffic were steadily   up during July and August compared with a year ago. After a relatively soft   July, sales and traffic picked up by mid-August at a South Dakota mall. Bank   directors noted that luxury goods showed signs of strength, such as sales of   jewelry and high-end vehicles.
Minnesota auto dealers were profitable, with recent sales up from last year   but still down substantially from 2006, according to an auto dealers association   representative. Two auto dealers in Montana reported recent gains in sales from   a year ago, but a third dealer described sales as dismal.
Tourism activity was solid in July and August. While early summer rains and   high river levels hampered fishing and other outdoor activities in Montana,   overall tourism picked up in July. Tourism businesses in northwestern Wisconsin   were busy during July and August, according to an official. Activity was up   about 5 percent compared with last year in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan;   hotels were able to raise prices without losing volume.
Commercial construction   activity has increased slightly since the last report. Respondents to a   mid-August Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey reported an increase in revenues,   primarily due to a number of small commercial retrofitting projects in the   Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Rebuilding in flood-damaged areas was also mentioned.   However, the value of commercial building permits in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area   was down slightly in July from July 2010. Residential construction increased   from last year. The value of residential building permits in July increased   significantly from the same period a year earlier in both the Sioux Falls and   Minneapolis-St. Paul areas.
Commercial real estate markets were flat. Commercial real estate respondents   to the Minneapolis Fed's ad hoc survey noted flat revenues and profits over the   past three months. Comments from Minneapolis-St. Paul area contacts include the   following: "There is very little activity in the leasing, sales and land   development arena." "The market is full of fence sitters because of general   uncertainty about the economy." Residential real estate markets grew. Home sales   in July were up significantly from the same period a year ago in the   Minneapolis-St. Paul and Fargo, N.D., markets. However, July pending sales of   homes in the Sioux Falls area decreased from July 2010.
On balance, professional business services firms   reported flat activity over the past three months. A third of services firms   that responded to the ad hoc survey saw increased sales, while a third saw   decreased sales. Respondents noted that profits were also flat, but they expect   increased activity over the next three months. An information technology company   noted that July sales were down due to reduced demand from the government and   financial services areas.
Manufacturing activity increased slightly.   A July survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.)   showed that manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and South Dakota, but   declined slightly in North Dakota. A metal fabricator announced plans to expand   a facility in northwestern Montana. Nearly three-quarters of manufacturing   respondents to the Minneapolis Fed's ad hoc survey indicated that their sales   increased in the past three months, and 60 percent expect them to increase in   the next three months.
Activity in the energy and mining   sectors continued at strong levels since the last report. Late-August oil   exploration activity increased from mid-July. Iron ore shipments from District   mines increased 18 percent in July from a year earlier, according to a Great   Lakes shipping organization. Activity at Montana mines remains strong, driven by   high metals prices, according to contacts.
Ninth District agricultural production is   expected to decrease from last year, while prices remain strong. Montana and   North Dakota durum wheat production estimates for 2011 were down a combined 57   percent from 2010, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Spring wheat   and soybean production estimates for District states were down 18 percent and 10   percent, respectively. In contrast, District corn production estimates increased   about 5 percent over last year. Prices for many District agricultural   commodities increased since the last report, including corn, soybeans, wheat,   dairy, cattle and hogs; poultry prices decreased recently.
Reports from labor markets   include a mix of layoffs and new hiring. During a 20-day Minnesota government   shutdown in July, 22,000 government employees were out of work. By delaying   state funding and inspections, the shutdown also idled many construction   projects across Minnesota. A bank recently announced plans to cut nearly 150   employees at its brokerage unit in Minneapolis. However, during July, Minnesota   gained 8,200 private sector jobs. Minnesota auto dealers have started to hire   more sales staff. About 11,000 new jobs related to oil drilling are expected in   North Dakota, according to an announcement by a firm with operations there.   According to the ad hoc survey, 19 percent of respondents expect to increase   employment over the next three months, while 10 percent expect to decrease   employment. A new fabrication plant in Montana will lead to 100 more jobs, and a   sporting goods manufacturer in Minnesota announced plans to add 100 jobs over   the next two years.
Wage increases remained moderate, although some contentious contract   negotiations were reported. For example, a sugar beet refining company locked   out 1,300 workers beginning Aug. 1.
Overall price increases were modest. A July Augustana College survey of Sioux   Falls businesses indicated little change in prices received for their products   and services. Except for gold, a number of metal prices have decreased since the   last report, although they remain well above year-earlier levels. Diesel fuel   and gasoline prices were still nearly a dollar per gallon higher than a year   ago, but their rate of increase has slowed. Input costs increased over the past   three months, according to 46 percent of the ad hoc survey respondents; only 9   percent indicated decreases.
