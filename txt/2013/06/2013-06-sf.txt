Economic activity in the Twelfth District expanded at a modest pace during the reporting period of early April through late May. Price inflation was subdued for most final goods and services, and upward wage pressures were limited overall. Retail sales were a bit soft, while demand for business and consumer services was mixed. District manufacturing activity rose on net. Production and sales of agricultural items increased modestly. Residential real estate activity expanded robustly, and commercial real estate activity trended up, although somewhat unevenly across geographic areas. Contacts from financial institutions reported slight increases in overall loan demand.
Contacts reported that wage gains were limited overall. Labor market slack continues to put downward pressure on wages and compensation for most sectors, occupations, and regions. However, various contacts indicated some upward wage pressure for skilled construction workers, software developers, and certain technical and managerial positions in high-tech manufacturing.
Demand for business and consumer services was mixed. Food service providers reported strong sales on net, with some discount chains faring particularly well. Robust activity in Hawaii supported the District's travel and tourism sector, although there is some concern that the flow of international visitors could taper off in coming months due to potential weakness in the global economy. Travel and tourist activity in Southern California has declined a bit. Demand for both health-care and legal services was flat. Compared with previous months, contacts dialed back their expectations for robust growth of various technology services such as cloud computing and data processing this year.
