Reports from Sixth District business contacts indicated that economic activity   expanded moderately in late November and December, with most expecting continued   modest growth in early 2013. District merchants cited mildly positive holiday sales, while tourism   contacts noted continued strength in both business and leisure travel.   Residential real estate contacts experienced ongoing modest sales growth for   both new and existing homes on a year-over-year basis, while commercial contacts   described demand conditions as improving, especially in the multifamily segment   of the market. Manufacturers, on the other hand, noted a decline in orders and   production. Reports from bankers indicated that loan demand had strengthened,   driven in large part by an increase in mortgage lending. Employment levels   across the District expanded at a modest pace, while pricing pressures remained   subdued. Consumer Spending and Tourism District contacts reported   cautious optimism following a robust start to the holiday season. While sales   were better than expected over the Thanksgiving weekend, reports covering the   entire holiday season showed that total sales, although above year-ago results,   did not appear to meet expectations. Deep discounting was prevalent throughout   the holiday season. Auto sales remained robust and truck sales were somewhat   positive with sales of replacement vehicles driving the growth for that segment. Travel and tourism contacts continued to report strong activity. Hospitality   contacts noted increases in visitation and spending in the final quarter of   2012. Lower gasoline prices boosted leisure travel. Business travel and   attendance at major conventions also increased. International visitors continued   to lift tourism activity and advance reservations of international travel have   exceeded expectations. The outlook for 2013 remained positive with hospitality   contacts projecting increases in occupancy rates and revenue per available room. Real Estate and Construction The majority of District   residential brokers reported that recent existing home sales were ahead of year   earlier levels. Sales growth was strongest in Florida. Most brokers in the   region again noted declining inventories and rising home prices. Buyer traffic   remained ahead of the year-ago level by most accounts. For 2013, most anticipate   home sales growth will continue to improve slowly. Reports from District homebuilders were a bit more positive than in our last   report. Builders reported that recent new home sales and construction activity   were slightly ahead of year-earlier levels. The majority of builders continued   to report that new home inventories were below the year-ago level and prices   were up slightly. Buyer interest remained strong but several builders continued   to note difficulty securing development and construction financing. Despite the   challenges, the outlook for construction activity remained positive and builders   anticipate new home sales in 2013 to exceed 2012 levels across many parts of the   District. Reports from District commercial contractors indicated that the pace of   construction activity improved modestly from the third to fourth quarter and was   ahead of the previous year's performance. Apartment development was particularly   strong. The pipeline for commercial construction at the end of the fourth   quarter was greater than the year-ago level by most accounts. Most said that   commercial construction development financing remained scarce. However, the   outlook for 2013 remained positive as most contacts expect commercial   construction activity to be slightly ahead of 2012 levels. Commercial brokers   indicated that most office, industrial, and retail markets in the District   experienced modestly positive absorption rates. Overall, contacts continued to   anticipate steady, but slow improvements in District commercial real estate   markets during 2013. Manufacturing and Transportation Manufacturing contacts   in the region reported that new orders and production contracted in December.   Finished inventory levels also declined from the previous month. However, nearly   half of manufacturing contacts expect production to be higher than current   levels over the next three-to-six months, up from just under one-third in   November. Trucking contacts reported a notable increase in tonnage in November,   representing the first gain since July 2012, and offsetting a drop in October's   readings. Reports suggested that Hurricane Sandy affected both months' readings.   A large truck dealer reported it is expanding sales to include flatbed trailers   in response to anticipated increased movement of construction materials as a   result of improvements in the housing sector. Railroad contacts reported an   increase in total carloads in November over year-ago levels with the largest   increases occurring in chemicals and agricultural products while declines were   noted in coal, metallic ores, and metals. Concerns grew over low river levels   that have led to delays in Mississippi River barge traffic. Banking and Finance Many banking contacts indicated loan   demand had increased and they've added lending specialists to deal with current   and anticipated demand. Competition for quality borrowers remained fierce and   there was some indication that banks were more willing to increase their   tolerance for risk. Auto lending remained active and some depository   institutions noted more loan growth in November and December. Low rates   encouraged mortgage activity, and purchases accounted for a larger share of   mortgage loans than in the recent past. Community banks reported spending a   larger portion of their income on compliance and remained concerned about   increasing regulatory pressures. Employment and Prices Since the last report, payroll   growth increased mildly across the District, though contacts said that   uncertainty over fiscal policy and healthcare costs tempered hiring decisions.   Aggregate gains in job growth across the District were fueled largely by strong   job growth in Florida and Louisiana. Contacts in Florida's leisure and   hospitality industry reported moderately improved hiring expectations, while the   construction, retail, and energy sectors in Louisiana saw relatively healthy   increases in employment in November and December. Pricing pressures remained subdued, according to results from our December   Business Inflation Expectations survey which indicated that unit costs were up   1.5 percent over the past 12 months, which is down from 1.7 percent in November.   Margins improved somewhat in December, especially for retail contacts who   reported being able to pass on slightly higher markups compared to the holiday   season in 2011. Looking forward, year-ahead unit cost expectations of businesses   were 1.9 percent in December, moderating from 2.1 percent the month before.   Businesses continued to cite costs relating to tax policy, regulation, and   healthcare as sources of uncertainty going into 2013. Natural Resources and Agriculture Planned investments,   ranging from reserve development to increased refining and petrochemical   operations to new pipeline infrastructure, continued to take place in the energy   sector. For example, preparation for development of a large gas-to-liquids (GTL)   and ethane cracker complex in Louisiana was announced, which is expected to   increase the region's production capacity for GTL diesel and ethylene.   Separately, industry contacts maintained that higher margins for natural gas   liquids and other associated products continued to warrant ongoing drilling in   natural gas wells, despite low prices for natural gas. In the midst of an   apparent surge in investment activity in the energy industry, District contacts   continued to cite a shortage of specialized skilled labor as a significant   hurdle facing expansion plans going forward. Prices for corn, soybeans, beef, and poultry remained above year-ago levels,   while the price for cotton was lower than this time last year. Dry conditions   persisted in much of the District, although late December rains helped many   areas in the region.
