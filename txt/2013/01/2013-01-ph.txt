Aggregate business activity in the Third District has resumed the modest pace of   growth that was evident prior to the disruption by Hurricane Sandy during the   previous Beige Book period. In particular, general retail sales, general   services, and commercial real estate leasing recovered from temporarily mild   growth rates to resume their previously modest growth rates. Sales of new and   used autos accelerated to a moderate rate of growth, and residential real estate   sales maintained a strong year-over-year growth rate (from a relatively low   base). Mild rates of growth are once again evident in manufacturing, staffing   services, transportation services, and construction after many sectors suffered   storm-related disruptions. Lending volumes at Third District banks also   continued to experience slight growth, and credit quality has continued to   improve. Overall, beach-going tourist areas are experiencing a typical slow   season; however, some storm-damaged areas have lost significant business while   some areas that escaped the damage are doing well. General price levels, as well   as wages and home prices, were reported to have increased slightly overall. This   remains similar to the last Beige Book period, except for home prices, which had   remained flat overall.
The overall outlook for at least modest growth is considerably more   optimistic relative to the views expressed in the last Beige Book. Contacts   reported underlying strength in many sectors and expressed relief that part of   the fiscal cliff dilemma has been resolved. Contacts from virtually all sectors   reported greater expectations of future growth than during our last survey   period. Plans for future hiring were also significantly more expansive. Most   contacts continued to express concerns over the impact from the recent payroll   tax increase and the remaining potential budget cuts that might reduce demand.
Since the last Beige Book, Third District   manufacturers have reported that orders and shipments have recovered to a pace   of slight growth. The mild pace can be partially attributed to seasonal trends.   Comments from contacts focused primarily on small upticks, new product demand,   and emerging markets, rather than on disappointing orders. Makers of food   products, lumber and wood products, primary metals, fabricated metal products,   and instruments have reported gains since the last Beige Book. Lower activity   was reported by makers of industrial machinery and electronic equipment.
Optimism among Third District manufacturers that business conditions will   improve during the next six months has rebounded strongly since the last Beige   Book and is evident across nearly all sectors. Firms have also significantly   raised their overall expectations of future hiring and their plans for capital   spending since the last Beige Book.
Third District retail sales recovered to a modest   pace of growth for the holiday shopping season after the disruptions of   Hurricane Sandy, according to retail contacts. Sales reports were mixed for   mid-market department stores and some home furnishing stores, which reported   moderate early holiday sales gains followed by a lull, with slight declines from   the prior year. High-end department stores, family apparel stores, and outlet   stores reported modest or moderate year-over-year sales throughout the holiday   period. Some substantial mall tenants posted strong double-digit sales growth.   Until final sales are tallied, retail contacts relied on other early indicators   to suggest that the final days of the holiday shopping season had grown   modestly, or better. Traditional mall retailers continued to draw shoppers with   promotions, while outlet stores used fewer promotions than in prior years.   Shopper surveys revealed concern over the consumers' future paychecks from the   pending fiscal cliff negotiations.
Auto sales finished the year at a moderate pace of growth--combining the   sector's slower pre-storm pace with a bump up for replacement of cars damaged by   the storm. In particular, New Jersey dealers reported strong double-digit   December sales, capping a third consecutive year of sales growth. The outlook   among dealers remains positive; however, prospects for 2013 are not as strong as   they were for 2012. "Consumers will feel a pinch" from the payroll tax increase   and continued uncertainty about possible budget cuts.
Overall, loan volumes have continued to grow at a   slight pace across Third District financial firms since the previous Beige Book.   A flurry of year-end business lending kept banks busy facilitating tax-oriented   business decisions involving sales and liquidations, mergers and acquisitions,   accelerated depreciation, and dividend payouts. Home mortgage refinancing rates   continued to remain high. In describing their competition as very aggressive,   lenders expressed awareness of some potential portfolio risk, even while the   credit quality of their borrowers continued to improve. Generally, financial   institutions are expecting growth to continue, if not improve.Â Â
Residential builders   reported one final surge of contract activity in November and then a downswing   in December to conclude with slight year-over-year growth for the period.   Despite facing erratic swings in demand through the year, our contacts reported   very strong year-over-year growth for the entire year, which is more indicative   of their own gains in market share than of the sector overall. Residential   brokers reported robust year-over-year sales growth in November, with steady   year-end momentum. As with new home construction, existing home sales are   growing from a low base. Builders and, to a greater extent, brokers are   optimistic that recent growth will be sustained in 2013. As with other sectors,   contacts expressed concern that the fiscal cliff negotiations had been extended   into their important first quarter.
Nonresidential real estate contacts reported renewed modest growth in overall   leasing activity and continued slight growth in construction. Leasing activity   finished the year with sustained double-digit growth. Notably, in the fourth   quarter, contacts began "to see a re-emergence of leasing demand in lagging   submarkets" (in the Greater Philadelphia metro area), including southern New   Jersey. Stronger employment growth of professional services is credited with   much of the demand; however, that demand is partially offset, as existing firms   are consolidating and adjusting to more efficient overall office spaces with   smaller square footage per person. New construction of large   industrial/warehouse space is planned in 2013 in the Harrisburgâ€“Lehigh Valley   corridor on the heels of similar spaces built this year; no such construction is   anticipated in the southern New Jersey market area. New apartment/condominium   projects continue to emerge throughout the Greater Philadelphia region,   especially in Center City. Nonresidential real estate contacts retain an outlook   of slow, steady growth.
Third District service-sector firms have resumed   a more modest pace of growth since the last Beige Book, according to contacts in   various sectors. Tourist areas along the Delaware and New Jersey shores are in   various stages of recovery from Hurricane Sandy. Atlantic City casinos reported   significantly lower revenues in November (as much as $55 million) compared with   2011. Businesses and rental housing that serve the central and northern Jersey   Shore communities continued to lose some of the money they would have earned in   the low season. Southern New Jersey and Delaware beach communities are largely   intact and operating normally. A Delaware beach hotel owner reported a strong   December finish to the year, which was partly due to an extra holiday weekend.   District staffing firms reported a mild pace of growth at year's end â€“ an   improvement after the storm disruptions. Staffing contacts expect moderate   growth in 2013 but are watching their clients' reactions to the serial fiscal   cliff decisions. Defense-related firms received no relief from the uncertainty   of budget cuts that has held their business plans in stasis for the past year.   Overall, service-sector firms expressed more confidence in their expectations   for growth in the near future.
Overall, price levels continued to   increase slightly, similar to the previous Beige Book. Cost factors among   manufacturing firms held steady, while the prices they received rose a little.   Tighter auto inventories generate a price environment that favors auto dealers   over their customers. Homebuilders noted that rising commodity prices had added   about 3 percent to the cost of a new home in the past 90 days. In addition,   roofing and siding contractors have lost crews to the Jersey Shore repairs. Real   estate contacts continued to report that house prices are firming up and that   houses in some markets are receiving multiple offers. Rents are rising in most   segments of the Philadelphia central business district market and for industrial   space along the corridor from Carlisle, PA, to the Lehigh Valley. In other   segments and geographies, rents are flat or still falling. Contacts from all   sectors continued to report that wages rose only a little, if at all. After a   good year, two homebuilders reported issuing the first pay raises to their   staffs in several years. Contacts did report strong growth in unemployment   compensation and workers' compensation costs.
