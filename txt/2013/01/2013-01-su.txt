All twelve districts reported some growth in consumer spending. Overall,   holiday sales were reported as being modestly higher than in 2011, though sales   were below expectations for contacts in many of the Districts. Auto sales were   reported as steady or stronger in ten Districts. Citing concerns that consumers   will spend cautiously due to ongoing fiscal uncertainty, retail contacts and   auto dealers reported a slightly dimmer, though positive, outlook for future   sales. Tourism activity was reported to have increased across much of the nation   due to strong business and international travel, early snowfall in some ski   areas, and a rebound in areas disrupted by Hurricane Sandy.
Activity among nonfinancial service sectors improved overall. Firms within   the six Districts reporting on transportation services generally noted increased   volumes. Manufacturing was mixed overall since the previous Beige Book; six   Districts reported an expansion of activity and three reported a decrease. Among   Districts reporting on their firms' near-term expectations, the manufacturing   outlook remained generally optimistic; however, capital spending plans were less   uniformly positive.
Since the previous Beige Book, real estate activity has expanded or held   steady in eleven Districts for existing home sales and leasing; eight Districts   for residential construction; eleven Districts for nonresidential sales and   leasing; and nine Districts for nonresidential construction. Overall loan demand   was steady in five Districts, rose in four, and fell in one. Credit standards   were largely unchanged, except in two Districts where there were some signs of   loosening. Six Districts reported improving credit quality and/or falling   delinquency rates.
Although rain partially eased drought conditions for some agricultural   regions in three Districts, reports of agricultural activity remained mixed.   Districts reported that energy and mining sector activity was steady at high   levels for most energy-related products but significantly weaker in coal   production and coal-related investments.
Trends in wages, prices, and employment conditions were relatively unchanged   in the Federal Reserve Districts. Input price pressures were reported to be   steady overall with mixed reports for specific commodity prices in various   Districts. Employment conditions were also little changed since the last report.   However, hiring plans were more cautious for firms doing business in Europe or   in the defense sector. Wage pressures were stable in all twelve Districts,   though several Districts cited greater pressures for firms that reported   difficulties finding qualified workers with specific skills.
Since the previous Beige   Book, consumer spending increased to some degree in all twelve Districts. Across   the nation, holiday sales grew modestly compared with last year but came in   below expectations in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San   Francisco Districts. Boston reported continued strong demand for clothing,   shoes, and furniture, and San Francisco reported robust online sales. A major   retail chain in New York indicated that sales picked up in early January. Retail   sales were flat in Richmond except for gains in food and auto sales.   Expectations for future sales were positive but mild, particularly in   Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas where contacts cited the impact of fiscal   cliff uncertainty on consumer spending.
Reports of auto sales were steady to stronger in ten Districts. Richmond,   Atlanta, and San Francisco noted strong sales. New York and Dallas cited mixed   sales that were generally positive, while auto sales in Kansas City slowed but   remained higher than a year ago. Some dealers in the Chicago and Kansas City   Districts reported high levels of inventory. Contacts in Philadelphia,   Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas expect consumers to react to ongoing fiscal   uncertainty, thus dimming a positive outlook for future sales. Chicago auto   dealers were more upbeat, expecting stronger new car sales due to pent-up   consumer demand, easing credit conditions, and rising used vehicle prices.
Tourism held steady or grew in all but one of eight reporting Districts.   Coastal activity had fallen in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sandy   throughout most of the New York and Philadelphia Districts but has rebounded in   all but the hardest hit areas. Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco reported   strong tourism in their Districts, with Boston and Atlanta citing business and   international travel as strong contributors. Winter tourism activity in the   Minneapolis District was strong in areas with snow, while Richmond reported   normal winter activity in its District.
Overall, nonfinancial services have   grown modestly since the previous Beige Book. Businesses in the New York and   Philadelphia Districts recovered from the disruption of Hurricane Sandy. The   Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported positive growth among   various service sectors, while the Richmond District reported stable to stronger   demand for service firms. Boston reported strong demand for some health-care IT   services and drug impact research, while San Francisco noted relatively weak   demand for health-care services. Staffing firms in the Dallas District reported   steady to slightly softened demand. Respondents remained optimistic about growth   over the near-term in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and   Dallas Districts.
Transportation services were generally positive among the six Districts that   reported. Freight transport shipping volume improved in the Cleveland District   due to rising demand from the retail sector and areas affected by Hurricane   Sandy. Atlanta reported increases in trucking tonnage and total railroad   carloads, but low river levels caused delays in Mississippi River traffic.   Reports from transportation services in the Dallas District were mixed, and most   firms expect weak growth in the near-term. Trucking firms in the Richmond   District reported a flattening in revenues; however, the District's port   activity was boosted by ships diverted by Hurricane Sandy.
Reports of manufacturing activity were   mixed overall, with six Districts growing since the last Beige Book, three   Distracts contracting, and two Districts reporting little or no change. Firms in   the Boston and Chicago Districts reported continued expansion of activity at   modest and moderate rates of growth, respectively. Overall activity once again   appeared to expand in the San Francisco District, although it was mixed across   sectors.Â  Gains in the aerospace and chemical sectors contributed to growth in   the Boston and San Francisco Districts, as well as in the Dallas District.   Manufacturing in the Chicago District grew with contributions from the auto and   housing-related sectors. Manufacturing continued to expand, but at a more modest   pace, in the Richmond District. Several firms cited falling export demand,   especially from Europe.
In contrast to slight declines in the past Beige Book, firms in the   Philadelphia and Minneapolis Districts reported slightly increased manufacturing   activity. As in other Districts, product flowing into supply channels for auto   production and housing construction contributed to Philadelphia's gains. Prior   trends continued as firms in the New York District experienced little or no   growth, except for the revenues of firms in the New York City area that   recovered after Hurricane Sandy disruptions. Reports continued to be mixed among   sectors in the Dallas District.Â
Manufacturing activity within the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts, and   reported plans in the St. Louis District, declined somewhat--a trend reversal   from the prior Beige Book. Contributing to the declines were steel and auto   producers in Cleveland and makers of HVAC equipment, electric components, food,   and automobile parts in St. Louis. Despite production gains in electrical   equipment, appliances, and components, more pronounced contractions within the   broad nondurable goods sector led to a continuation of declining activity in the   Kansas City District.
Manufacturing firms' expectations of future activity were generally   optimistic in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City   Districts; the level of optimism has significantly increased in the Philadelphia   and Atlanta Districts since the previous Beige Book. Contacts in the Chicago   District expect vehicle production to expand in 2013, while reports of activity   from manufacturers in the St. Louis District have been negative on net. Boston   District firms reported that capital spending was slow, except for select growth   sectors. Capital spending was on track in the Cleveland District and was slowly   increasing in the Chicago District. Looking ahead, Philadelphia District firms   have significantly increased their capital spending plans, while the outlook in   the Minneapolis District was reported as flat. In the Cleveland District, more   contacts plan to reduce outlays than expand capacity.
Existing residential real   estate activity expanded in all Districts that reported; growth rates were   described as moderate or strong in nine Districts. Contacts in the Boston   District attributed their strong sales growth to low interest rates, affordable   prices, and rising rents. All Districts reporting on price levels saw increases;   New York and Chicago reported only very minor increases. The five Districts that   reported on housing inventories all reported falling levels. New residential   construction (including repairs) expanded in all but one District of those   Districts that reported. Contacts in the Kansas City District reported that   increased lumber and drywall costs limited construction, causing a slight   decline this period. Hurricane Sandy disrupted construction activity initially   in New York, but this has since led to increased work for subcontractors on   repairs and reconstruction.
Though a little weaker than residential real estate, reports on sales and   leasing of nonresidential real estate are still mostly positive--described as   modest on average. The Boston District reported a drop in leasing beyond normal   seasonal trends; contacts cited fiscal cliff uncertainty as a factor.   Minneapolis and Kansas City reported increased demand and tightening commercial   real estate markets. Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas all reported more   modest increases in nonresidential real estate activity. Nonresidential   construction is weaker than residential, with only slight to modest growth. The   Boston District reported that demand for commercial real estate loans appears to   be softening and that the pipeline for new construction projects has diminished   significantly since the last report. Dallas reported that construction was   expected to pick up in the commercial real estate sector in 2013.
Overall, loan demand was largely   unchanged in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and San   Francisco Districts, with most of these Districts reporting a continuation of   slight to moderate growth in total volume. The New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and   Dallas Districts reported stronger demand than previously, while the St. Louis   District reported a slight decline. Some increased lending in Philadelphia,   Chicago, and Dallas was driven by businesses taking out loans for special   year-end purposes such as tax planning and dividend payments. Cleveland,   Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported strong auto lending.   Demand for residential mortgages improved in Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas   City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Commercial real estate lending was cited as a   particular bright spot by New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas. However,   lenders in San Francisco remained reluctant to lend to real estate investors   outside of the multifamily residential sector. San Francisco also reported a   slight slowdown in IPO, venture capital, and private equity activity in that   District's technology sector.
Banks in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San   Francisco Districts reported improvements in asset quality. Lenders were   described as competing aggressively for highly qualified borrowers in   Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco. In Atlanta, this stiff   competition may be leading to loosening credit standards, as there was some   indication that banks were more willing to increase their tolerance for risk.   Chicago banks also reported some loosening of standards. On the other hand,   lending standards remained largely unchanged in New York, Cleveland, and Kansas   City.
Reports of agricultural   activity were mixed, although rain and mild temperatures delivered some relief   from drought conditions to parts of the Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago   Districts. Low water levels along the Mississippi River also hampered transport   for some contacts in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts. Despite the drought,   some contacts in these Districts reported that farm income remained high with   adequate crop insurance and historically high prices. Producers in the Kansas   City and Dallas Districts expect ongoing dry conditions to hurt the winter wheat   crop.
Activity in the energy sector had mixed reports. Production of oil and   natural gas held steady at high--sometimes record--levels in the Cleveland,   Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. San Francisco reported that   activity expanded to historic levels. Contacts in the Cleveland District   reported that shale gas activity grew at a robust pace. In contrast, coal   production has declined in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and   Kansas City Districts since the previous Beige Book. Firms in the Atlanta   District continue to plan investments, ranging from reserve development to   increased refining and petrochemical operations to new pipeline infrastructure.
Labor market conditions   remained mostly unchanged in all Districts. The Boston, Richmond, Atlanta,   Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all reported delayed hiring,   often in defense manufacturing, due to fiscal cliff uncertainties. Companies in   the Chicago District with trade or investment exposures to Europe reduced their   hiring plans as well. Chicago reported that manufacturers are choosing to cut   hours instead of reducing head count in expectation of production rebounds in   2013. Atlanta and Kansas City cited health-care policy changes and costs as   another cause for minimal hiring. On the other hand, the New York, Atlanta,   Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts saw the labor market firming modestly.   Finally, contacts in several Districts reported difficulties finding qualified   workers in some specialized fields, such as skilled manufacturing, energy, and   IT.
For those Districts that reported, wage pressures have been stable since the   previous Beige Book and were most frequently described as contained or subdued.   The San Francisco District reported modest wage pressures that were held down by   an abundance of workers. The Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts   characterized wage growth as moderate. Specifically, business contacts in the   Minneapolis District expected to increase wages 2 to 3 percent in 2013, while   oil drilling companies in North Dakota and Montana expected higher increases.   Several Districts reported wage pressures in sectors experiencing labor   shortages, such as energy and IT. The New York and Chicago Districts reported   higher year-end bonuses ahead of anticipated tax increases in 2013.
Overall, input price pressures appear to be stable. The Boston, Philadelphia,   Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported   steady input prices, while Chicago reported decreasing raw materials prices. The   New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts characterized input prices as   slightly increasing; price pressures in these Districts were passed through to   consumers somewhat in the form of higher finished goods prices. However, Chicago   noted that businesses were unable to fully pass on meat and milk price increases   to consumers. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San   Francisco Districts all cited rising prices for construction-related materials.   Specifically, a Philadelphia builder noted that over the past 90 days these   rising prices added about 3 percent to the cost of a new home.
