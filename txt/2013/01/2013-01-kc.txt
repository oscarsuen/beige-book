The Tenth District economy expanded modestly in November and December. After a   strong start to holiday shopping, retail sales remained solid as the holiday   season progressed and vehicle sales remained higher than a year ago.   Manufacturing activity, while above year-ago levels, eased further, especially   in the non-durable goods sector. Although energy activity remained historically   high, both oil and natural gas rig counts dropped and District contacts expected   further declines in the coming months. Residential and commercial real estate   markets strengthened as prices and sales trended up and inventories declined.   Bankers also reported strong demand for both residential and commercial real   estate loans. Historically high crop prices supported crop sector incomes, and   livestock profits improved with an uptick in livestock prices. Wage pressures   remained subdued except for the ongoing need to fill specialized positions in   energy, high-tech, transportation, and construction industries. Numerous   business contacts noted they were delaying hiring plans due to economic   uncertainty associated with the fiscal cliff and potential policy changes.
