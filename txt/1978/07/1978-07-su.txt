District reports continue to point to a slowdown in economic   activity in the second half of the year. However, current retail   sales and manufacturing activity continue to advance at a rapid   pace, although some industries have entered their normal midsummer   doldrums. Businessmen continue to manage inventories closely, and   growing uncertainty is deterring some capital spending. Higher prime   rates are expected as loan demands strengthen and bank deposit   inflows slow further. Although higher interest rates are not   expected to impact significantly on business borrowing, they have   led to fewer mortgage commitments. The prospects for farm income are   improved, and the demand for new equipment in some areas is rising.
Modest to brisk gains in retail sales are being reported across the   country, although the expected strength of sales at year-end remains   uncertain. New cars continue to sell well, but sales of other   durable goods are mixed. Minneapolis and Dallas suggest that retail   sales are increasing at unsustainable rates, while Atlanta indicates   a similar situation for new car sales. Chicago reports that   consumers continue to use installment credit freely, and there is   concern in the New York district that mounting consumer debt will   soon slow sales. Inventory levels remain within manageable limits,   although Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, and Kansas City indicate   stocks are on the high side. Atlanta is the only district where   retailers plan to build inventories through the summer.
Industrial production continues to grow at a brisk pace in most   districts, as evidenced by expanded employment, increased shipments,   and rising prices. Although some industries, such as autos and coal,   have geared down to slower rates of summer output, production in   such durable goods industries as fabricated metals, transportation   equipment, construction materials, and defense goods are on the   rise. Nonetheless, many manufacturers are pessimistic about business   conditions at year-end and are keeping a tight rein on factory   inventories.
Despite the recent runup in imports, steel companies in the   Cleveland and Chicago districts remain heavily booked, and   production is expected to remain strong. But inventory levels,   especially in the distribution channels, are building and may hamper   further price increases.
Capital spending plans vary widely. Low rates of return and   uncertainties over inflation, government regulations, and economic   policies are listed as obstacles to increasing capital outlays. San   Francisco notes investment plans by several industries are short of   that needed to meet future product demand. While no significant   changes in capital spending are anticipated by Philadelphia, large   expenditures are in the offing for commercial aircraft, rail cars,   and heavy trucks and trailers, according to New York and Chicago.
Credit demands at commercial banks are expected to strengthen for   the remainder of the year. Continued slowing in deposit growth is   holding down the liquidity positions of most banks, and bankers are   becoming more selective in processing loan applications. While   business loans, consumer installment credit, and agricultural   lending account for much of the growth in bank loans in many   districts, New York points to the financing of mergers and   acquisitions and inventories as sources of loan demand in that   district. Interest rates are expected to continue to rise with the   prime rate climbing 25 to 100 basis points by year-end, according to   Philadelphia and Kansas City. Although the new six-month money   market CD's appear to be adding little to overall deposit growth,   they are helping many banks, and especially S&Ls, to hold on to   some savings deposits.
Residential construction in many areas is being pinched as tight   mortgage markets are leading to sharp reductions in new commitments.   Chicago indicates that residential permits and sales of existing   homes are down 30 to 40 percent in some areas from a year ago. The   uncertainty of property tax cuts promised by Proposition 13 is an   additional factor that is holding back home sales, according to San   Francisco. Slowdowns in residential construction are anticipated by   St. Louis and Minneapolis, while Cleveland reports housing starts   will remain strong for the remainder of the year, regardless of   sales. Demand for mortgages also remains vigorous in the Atlanta and   Dallas districts.
Financial conditions in the agricultural sector show some   improvement with higher livestock prices. But Atlanta reports some   weakening of farm prices in recent weeks, and Kansas City indicates   that the abundant wheat harvest should preclude a runup in wheat   prices. Prospects of improved farm incomes are adding to demands for   farm equipment, according to Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas. Soil   moisture conditions are generally adequate, but shortages are   reported in the Southeast and portions of the plains.
