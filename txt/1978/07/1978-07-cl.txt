Summer vacations and the model changeover in the automotive industry   are hampering this quarter's production of autos, steel, and coal in   the Fourth District. Retailers are facing a larger than usual   liquidation of stocks of new cars and of general merchandise.   Capital spending still lacks a broad-based expansion, and demand for   mortgage credit continues strong despite higher interest rates.
Retailers in the District are still cautious in their appraisals of   consumer behavior. Car sales have been sustained at near-record   rates since spring. Still, some auto producers expect annual rates   of sales this half to fall about 6 percent from the 10 million   annual rate of domestic sales last quarter. Inventories are large   and still imbalanced, but a larger than usual summer runoff of   stocks is expected (especially with a longer Ford shutdown for model   changeovers because of downsizing of Ford and Mercury cars).   Uncertain over sales prospects, officials with department stores   expect smaller gains in real sales for the second half of this year   as compared to the first half. Strength in sales has not been   broadly based, and inventories of summer goods are heavy. Thus,   retailers of general merchandise will be forced to vigorously   promote goods throughout the summer with the result that some   department and variety stores will likely experience either no   improvement or another decline in profits this quarter. Also, some   retailers apparently will be cautious in ordering fall and winter   merchandise. An official with a major appliance producer reports a   strong increase in unit sales of appliances, especially freezers. He   reports some excess stocks of ranges and laundry equipment at the   distributor level and believes stocks of appliances, except   freezers, are large, although masked by a high volume of sales.
Steel production this quarter is not expected to fall as much as   usual during the summer months, and industry economists expect the   operating rate for the industry to hold close to 90 percent of   effective capacity. Order books for July are full, in part because   of another steel price hike at the end of this month, and order   volume for August and September is better than expected in view of   uncertainties over auto production and ample availability of world   steel supplies. Steel economists are somewhat concerned over an   unexpectedly large buildup of inventories held by distributors.   While this buildup has not hampered orders, inventories may be more   than ample later this year. Also, a common complaint is that the   trigger price system does not seem to be working as evidenced by the   much stronger than expected volume of steel imports in May. Steel   price differentials have narrowed in favor of U.S. producers and   have contributed to a sharply reduced volume of imports from Japan   and Western European producers. But imports this year from Third   World nations, including Korea, South Africa, and Spain, have risen   sharply from a year earlier. Unless imports in June and succeeding   months abate from the 18 million ton annual rate in May, some   domestic producers may consider filing dumping charges.
The rebound in coal production following the long strike is being   temporarily hampered by usual summer vacation shutdowns of mines.   Production has failed to reach peak levels of late last year, which   according to an industry economist, reflects weaker than expected   demand for coal. Coal stocks apparently were not run down as badly   as reported during the strike, and utilities are not rebuilding   stocks as much as expected. According to some utilities, electric   power consumption since the coal settlements has not risen in line   with industrial activity because of conservation programs.
The continued lack of broad-based strength in capital goods   industries is hampering a robust expansion in spending. For example,   capital goods producers of rolling mills and steelmaking facilities   still see no meaningful strengthening in sales this year. They   report that their order backlogs so far this year have trended   downward. A producer of turbines, generators, and nuclear systems   reports sales to utilities are still soft, although industrial   equipment business continues to be strong. On the other hand, a   producer of computers, point-of-sale terminals, and electronics   business machines reports sales and backlogs continue to rise,   although not at an accelerating rate. A producer of printing and   communication equipment reports a spurt in orders in June following   a May drop and that backlogs are still growing but less rapidly than   last winter.
Builders and mortgage lenders concur that demand for housing and   mortgage credit remains strong, although there are some scattered   signs of buyer resistance to high prices and tightened mortgage   terms. Consumer resistance to higher mortgage rates is not as strong   as during the tightness in mortgage markets in 1974, according to a   financial officer with a major national builder of new houses. He   expects housing starts to remain strong at least through the fourth   quarter of 1978 regardless of sales. His firm's backlog has been   stretched out because of bottlenecks in skilled labor and materials.   Mortgage lenders, particularly S&Ls, report little sign of easing   in demand despite rising mortgage rates. In Cleveland, for example,   the rate of 80-percent loans is generally 9 3/4 percent, but a few   S&Ls are charging 10 percent. Some are no longer making 95-percent   loans or investment loans on land, apartments, and multifamily   units.
S&Ls are quite pleased with response to the six-month savings   certificate and indicate no waning in consumer interest since the   initial offering in early June. These S&Ls, however, have been   aggressively promoting certificates. Their view is that these   certificates helped boost deposits in June to the best volume so far   this year and have enabled these associations to meet strong loan   demand. Some report that at least 60 percent of the certificates   represent new money.
