Although businessmen increasingly regard prospects for late 1978 and   1979 as questionable, recent business reports have been largely   good. Consumer spending, still heavy, may have weakened a bit in   late June. Inventory trends are not clear, but we may be in for some   additional accumulations at the producer or wholesale levels.   Construction activity and prospects remain strong. Credit demands   are hefty, with sources of loanable funds generally adequate. Farm   product prices have softened; dry weather and labor shortages have   made trouble for crop producers.
Retail sales remain generally strong, but directors in several areas   reported a moderation in late June, particularly in sales of big-ticket items. Elsewhere, durables still appear to be dominating the   sales gains. More than one retailer has complained of sluggish   repayments.
Passenger cars have been moving at a rapid clip, with no one type   clearly a favorite. Some dealers are disappointed with the short   margins and slim profits they've pulled on their heavy volumes. Many   are dubious that such high sales levels can be maintained through   the fall. One director has already noticed a "drastic slowdown" in   his area.
Because of good sales prospects, businessmen plan to accelerate   their stock building through the summer, according to one director.   Retailers seem more cautious in their buying for fall and spring   1979, says another.
Judging from the recent volume of announcements of new plants,   capital expansions, and relocations, nonresidential construction   activity and building materials production should be quite strong   for several months. In Florida, a number of huge, long-term   residential developments, many backed by Canadian, Latin American,   or European money, have emerged from the planning stages. Forecasts   of a condominium shortage on the Gold Coast by year-end have become   common.
Demand for consumer, mortgage, and business loans continues vigorous   and has contributed to a rapid run-up of interest rates,   particularly local prime rates. An economist for a large Florida   holding company commented on the number of "marginal" business   borrowers who have "come out of the woodwork." His organization   feels it can be rather selective and still make all the loans it   wants (it's also planning for a "rather severe" recession within the   next few months).
Deposit inflows can still be characterized as moderate at most banks   and savings and loan associations. Updates on the six-month CDs   suggest that they are indeed drawing funds largely from passbook   savings, bringing in roughly one-third new money. There have been a   few more reports of S&Ls having trouble meeting loan demandsâ€”they've either quit accepting new applications or pushed back   commitments to the fourth quarter, when they expect funds to be more   adequate.
Prices of cattle and calves have been steady to slightly lower since   late May. The near-term outlook is for continued leveling, but live   prices may yet fall to forestall further increases in retail beef   prices, which have already met resistance from consumers. Heavy   marketings continue to delay the rebuilding of cattle herds. Broiler   placements are expanding rapidly in response to increasing prices.   Most crop prices have weakened in recent weeks. A dry spell in the   eastern part of the District has been threatening growing crops; in   the western area, weather conditions have improved. The shift to   soybeans has continued, with producers in some areas bidding up   rents and drawing land out of pasture to expand acreage. A labor   shortage in central Florida has left nearly 10 percent of the orange   crop still on the trees and forced early closings of several   concentrate plants. Unmanageable harvest costs, strong competition   from Mexican produce, and mediocre crop quality have prompted some   south Florida vegetable growers to open their fields to public   harvest.
Businessmen continue to be most deeply troubled by inflation and   what they perceive to be a lack of effective government measures to   restrain it. In August, 11,000 Southern Bell employees will receive   a 7-percent "cost-of-living" pay raise.
