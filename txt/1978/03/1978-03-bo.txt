First District respondents remain encouraged about the performance   of the New England economy. There is, however, significant concern   about the national situation. Retail sales have weakened, but this   is attributed to poor weather. Inventories are well under control.   Manufacturers appear to be doing well. Loan demand is moderately   good and expected to improve.
Retail sales in New England have weakened but bad weather was   undoubtedly a contributing factor; so it is difficult to determine   the underlying trend in consumer spending. A representative of a   large department store chain believes he sees the beginning of more   long lived slowing in retail sales. However, in northern New England   the tourist industry and all the retail outlets associated with it   are faring very well. Also, New England telephone companies report a   very active installation business, a phenomenon which they feel is   indicative of general economic health. Retail inventories are low   and no problems are expected in this area.
In the manufacturing sector, most reports are favorable. In northern   New England the electronics and plastics industries are enjoying   healthy demand; backlogs for machine tools continue to grow. Large   employers in the high technology fields in Massachusetts are also   reported to be doing well. One large producer of instruments has a   nine month order backlog. Another reports that they are still below   capacity but that order backlogs are significantly above this time a   year ago. The region continues to benefit from large defense   purchases. The one negative note, a mild one, came from a supplier   to the tire industry; sales of a key ingredient in tires are down 10   percent from a year ago. Other chemicals made by the same company   are also off slightly. As yet, New England has not seen any effects  of the coal strike, although there is some concern about what will   happen next month.
Loan demand at commercial banks is fairly good and is expected to   get better. According to one of the region's largest banks, domestic   loan demand is not as strong as desired, but there is substantial   optimism about 1978. A medium-size bank in northern New England   reports that commercial loan demand is very strong, although there   has been some seasonal weakening in construction loans. Installment   loan business after a brief slump has picked up.
Conversations with consultants following national industries   indicate that, aside from the coal strike, shortages are not going   to be an issue in 1978. There are some shortages of fine coated   papers but these can easily be dealt with by turning to imports or   heavier grades. One manufacturer reports difficulties getting   electronics components, particularly those from California. In the   steel industry, cutbacks in capacity combined with continued   recovery could produce shortages of certain products after 1980;   however, at present only oil and gas drilling equipment is in short   supply. In addition, despite its dependence on coal, the steel   industry is not any more likely to be affected by the coal strike   than are other industries in the mid-west. Coke stockpiles are   substantial and electric power cutbacks will limit production before   coke availability becomes a constraint. In petrochemicals and most   of the paper industry the problem is overcapacity. Among these   consultants there is considerable concern about the impact of higher   interest rates on the housing industry. One lumber specialist claims   that when rates on Treasury bills reach 6 percent, there is a marked   effect on housing and consequently on the lumber industry. In the   energy sector, the natural gas situation has improved. Production   last year was better than expected and this experience combined with   price increases has led at least one energy expert to increase his   production forecasts for 1978.
Professors Houthakker, Eckstein and Solow were available for comment   this month. All respondents agree that the dollar cannot be   successfully "defended" on foreign exchange markets unless the   imbalance in our trade and capital accounts is corrected. Moreover,   the recent decline in the dollar's exchange rate represent a normal   market response to our foreign deficit. In time, the declining   dollar will encourage foreign demand for our exports and discourage   our demand for imported goods; in this manner the recent   depreciation of the dollar will bring our accounts back into   balance. According to Eckstein, many businessmen fear that the   defense of unrealistic dollar exchange rates will ultimately lead to   exchange controls and further import restrictions. Although   Houthakker recognizes the need to temporarily settle disorderly   conditions which may arise occasionally on exchange markets, he   recommends selling gold rather than accumulating large debts in   foreign currencies.
Due to the coal strike and the winter weather, Eckstein expects 2.4   percent real growth during the first quarter of this year. Much of   the lost activity will then be regained in the second quarter when   growth will exceed 6 percent. Despite this acceleration, Eckstein   expects that real GNP will average only 4 percent growth during   1978, and there is a 45 percent chance that weak demands or a credit   crunch in the second half of the year could push the year's   expansion close to 3.5 percent. He believes it is important for the   Fed not to be misled by the "snap-back" in activity during the   coming months, the problem for 1978 is to avoid losing too much   momentum.
Solow is surprised by the sharp decline in the reported unemployment   rate since the end of 1977. The slow economic growth suggests that   policy should not become tighter; with low rates of capacity   utilization and the modest growth forecasts for 1978, the Fed should   still be concerned about maintaining the recovery and regaining full   production.
Neither Houthakker or Solow believe that the recent behavior of the   wholesale price index and the consumer price index warrant reaction   from the Fed. It is inappropriate to address problems of food   shortages with aggregate monetary policy. Recognizing that food   prices are highly volatile, especially during periods of adverse   weather, Houthakker has not changed his forecast of inflation, 6 to   7 percent for 1978.
