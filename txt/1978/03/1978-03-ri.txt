Despite some continuing disruptions from weather and strike related   energy curtailments Fifth District business activity made some   further advances over the past month. Responses to our survey of   District manufacturers suggest continued improvement in the volume   of new orders and further increases in backlogs of orders as well as   a minor rebound of shipments. On a less favorable note, however,   expanding inventories and rising prices were increasingly   widespread. In addition, retailers apparently experienced another   good month in terms of total sales. In spite of these improvements,   however, the expectations of manufacturers deteriorated further in   February. Judging from our survey responses, the general outlook is   now weaker than at any time since last October. A major factor here   seems to be the continued uncertainty regarding coal and other   energy supplies over the short-term.
Of manufacturers responding to our survey nearly 40% report   increased volumes of new orders in the past month and nearly as many   report larger backlogs of orders than a month earlier. In addition,   almost one-third report a higher level of shipments last month.   Nonetheless, inventories of materials and finished goods generally   expanded over the month and there remains a widespread feeling that   current stocks exceed desired levels. Employment among manufacturers   surveyed apparently declined slightly during the latest survey   period and the average work week was essentially unchanged.
In the retail sector, survey responses suggest continued improvement   in total sales and in the relative sales of big ticket items.   Inventories at retail were unchanged over the past month and are now   generally in line with desired levels.
Among respondents from both the manufacturing and retail sectors   reports of rising prices continue widespread. Over half of the   manufacturers surveyed report increases in prices paid over the past   month. With respect to the outlook for business activity over the   next six months, retailers remain basically optimistic.   Manufacturers show considerable disagreement. But approximately one-half of the manufacturers surveyed anticipate little or no change in   activity over the next six months while the rest are about evenly   divided between expecting worsening and improving conditions. Much   of the uncertainty among manufacturers appears to be linked to   growing concern about energy availability. Resolution of the coal   strike could result in a significant improvement in attitudes among   manufacturers, although some respondents believe that business  currently being lost because of energy curtailments will be   difficult to make, up later.
In the past week several utility companies in the District moved   into the second phase of emergency plans in an effort to cope with   dwindling coal stocks. In general, this meant further curtailments   of energy supplies to commercial and industrial users. It is not   clear at this point what these curtailments will involve in terms of   employment and production, but it appears likely that losses will be   small if coal shipments are resumed in fairly short order.
Bank credit activity in the Fifth District over the past several   weeks, after accounting for seasonal influences, appears moderate.   Real estate lending continues to be depressed as a result of a   weather related slow down, while consumer lending has essentially   leveled off. Regional businesses, however, have increased their   borrowings from District banks. At weekly reporting banks, lending   to regional firms is concentrated in the intermediate and short-term   categories. Demand for credit by large national firms is soft.
In the agricultural sector, estimated total cash receipts from farm   marketings in 1977 show the District figure about 5 percent below   the 1976 level as against a gain of about 1 percent nationally. This   comparison would seem to suggest that the proportion of farmers with   cash-flow problems may be somewhat larger in the District than in   the nation as a whole. A 3 percent increase in District livestock   receipts only partially offset an 11 percent decline in cash income   from crop marketings.
