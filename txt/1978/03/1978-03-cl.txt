The coal strike and unseasonably cold weather have continued to   hamper production, sales, income, and distribution in the Fourth   District. Indirect effects of the coal strike on employment have   been minimal. Economists who attended this Bank's recent meeting on   the economic outlook still expect growth in output at about a 3.8   percent annual rate and a 6 percent rate of inflation from the   fourth quarter 1977 to the fourth quarter 1978. Retailers have   experienced spotty sales for the past several weeks but remain   relatively optimistic that sales will pick up from recent low   levels. Savings and loan associations have not cut back commitments   or loans despite continued softening in deposit flows.
Electric power shortages have affected employment in the District   minimally and far less than indicated in widely publicized   estimates. Some manufacturers, as in the case of steel, have had to   stretch out production to protect energy supplies. More typically,   they have cut back on hours, lighting, and heating. In some cases,   they are diverting production to other plants not affected by the   power shortage. Moreover, many manufacturers have resorted to   alternate power sources, especially their own power generators.   Estimates indicate that industrial layoffs have affected perhaps   3,5000 to 5,000 of the 1,650,000 manufacturing workers in the   District. Utilities in Ohio still have coal stocks that range from   35 to 55 days' supply, not much less than a month ago, and the only   utility that has a mandatory curtailment is the smallest one in the   state that serves portions of southern Ohio. Utilities in the   Pittsburgh area have the lowest coal supplies and are operating with   mandatory curtailment, ranging from 10 percent to 25 percent. Other   utilities are reluctant to estimate when mandatory controls might be   imposed, given the highly fluid supply situation and. flexibilities   of large industrial users. Manufacturers generally claim they can   continue to operate without major layoffs even if 25 percent power   cutbacks are mandated, and some assert they can adjust to as much as   a 50 percent cutback because of backup power and conservation   measures.
Economists who attended this Bank's quarterly meeting on the   District's economy earlier this month were unconcerned about the   long-range effects of the weather and coal strike. The median   forecast of 29 economists shows continued expansion throughout the   year, with a 4.3 percent annual rate of gain in real GNP during the   first half of 1978, followed by a 3.4 percent rate in the second   half. Although the economists do not expect a credit crunch in 1978   despite increased demand, some viewed the probability of a crunch   and recession in 1979 as very high. Several also expect continued   upward pressure on interest rates in 1978, with the Federal funds   rate rising to 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1978.
Retailers still anticipate some spring rebound that would boost   sales from weakened first-quarter levels, although expected gains   are not likely to be as strong as in the final quarter of last year.   Strengthening from lows in January has been spotty partly because of   frigid weather in February. Some retailers also point out that a   letup in sales was expected after last quarter's surge in sales.   Inventories have been raised to unacceptable levels because of   unexpectedly slow apparel sales, according to an economist with a   major department store chain.
Eight automotive producers and suppliers forecast that domestic new   car sales in 1978 would range from 8.3 million to 9.0 million units,   with imports amounting to 1.7-1.9 million. Another economist placed   total new car sales this year at 10.9 million units. He acknowledges   that sales have been running somewhat below that projection because   of bad weather, the coal strike, and low public response to GMC   styling of intermediate cars. Still, he is reluctant to revise his   expectations downward at this time. For the longer term, he   expressed concern that imports from Japan may seriously threaten   domestic producers and sees little prospect for relief from a high   level of auto imports from Japan over the next few years. According   to his estimates, Japan has a large capacity to build cars   especially for the export market and has a sizable cost advantage   estimated at $650 per car over United States auto producers. This   year, for example, Japanese motor vehicle production is expected to   be stepped up to about 9.3 million, an increase of 800,000 from   1977. Virtually all this increase can be exported.
Bad weather depressed housing activity in the District again in   February, but demand for mortgage money continues to be strong.   Although savings and loan associations are increasingly concerned   over further slowing in deposits last month, they are not cutting   back on commitments. Liquidity continues to shrink, and a few   associations indicate that they are virtually at the ceiling of   reserve requirements. They will be required to step up their   borrowing and to increase their use of the secondary mortgage market   to support mortgage loan activity. Some lenders are less   apprehensive about commitments and lending prospects because they   hold a higher volume of certificates than they did in 1973. An   economist with a Federal Home Loan Bank in this District believes   that certificates are providing some protection against rising   interest rates. His estimates show that, if savings and loan   associations had the same deposit mix as prevailed at the beginning   of 1973, the slowdown in savings deposits would be at least $3.5   billion larger than otherwise. He expects 1.8-1.9 million new   housing starts this year.
Several District officials and economists consider inflation of   greater concern than the power shortage. Despite some potential   benefit to domestic steel producers, reference pricing of steel will   raise prices, according to some producers of steel fasteners and   metal products. Higher priced steel would cause users to raise   prices for finished products, which already are at a competitive   price disadvantage with foreign supplies.
Coal prices are expected to rise sharply this year. An economist   with a large coal producer estimates that a 37 percent contract   settlement for the coal industry would raise the price of utility   and industrial steam coal about 9.4 percent in 1978 and another 4.6   percent next year. In addition, environmental regulations will boost   coal cost by $2 per ton. On the other hand, prices of crude oil,   according to an oil economist, can be expected to increase less than   the assumed 6 percent underlying rate of inflation this year because   of ample capacity and slow growth of demand.
Steel economists are still relatively optimistic that production and   shipments of steel products will be about 10 percent stronger than   last year. Because production at some mills is being stretched out   to protect coke supplies, orders for this quarter are running ahead   of production and shipments. While uncertain about the effects of   reference pricing of steel, economists expect steel imports to fall   from 19 million tons last year to about 14-18 million tons this   year. One economist, who sees signs of accelerating orders from   capital producers, believes the industry may be operating close to   capacity by the year-end.
