Business managers in the Eighth District remain optimistic about   further economic gains, despite some setbacks this winter as a   result of unfavorable weather and the coal strike. Retail sales, in   recent weeks reported to be at about year-ago levels, are expected   to resume growth as normal weather returns. Inventories are   considered to be satisfactory. Some losses in manufacturing   production have occurred because of the weather and the coal strike,   but orders in most industries indicate that demand remains   relatively high. Construction activity in the District has also been   hampered by the weather, but demand for new homes continues to be   strong. In the financial sector, business loans at larger banks   increased substantially in recent weeks, and moderate increases have   occurred in most other loan categories.
Retail sales in recent weeks have been affected adversely by   unusually cold and snowy weather. St. Louis department store   representatives indicated that sales have about equaled year-ago   levels. Some sales gains, however, were registered in areas, such as   Little Rock, where weather conditions were not as severe as in St.   Louis and Louisville, for example. Automobile dealers report sales   were good on days with normal weather and that overall sales have   been running near year-ago levels. Retailers were generally   optimistic that the current slump in sales is temporary and that   sales gains will occur when the weather improves and the coal strike   is settled. Current inventories at the retail level are considered   to be satisfactory given the expected increases in sales this   spring. Retailers noted, however, that this assessment would change   rapidly if the expected sales gains are not forthcoming.
Major utility companies in the District report that coal stockpiles   have tended to stabilize in the past few days. This reflects some   voluntary cutbacks in electrical power usage, greater incoming coal   shipments, and the burning of larger quantities of higher-priced oil   and natural gas. Only voluntary reductions in electrical power usage   have occurred so far. With the tendency of coal stocks to stabilize   and the prospects for additional coal supplies as a result of the   Taft-Hartley injunction, the "crisis" situation appears to have   eased somewhat. None of the utilities contacted indicate mandatory   curtailments are in prospect in the near future.
The effects of the coal strike on employment and production have   been relatively minor in the District. A zinc processing plant in   the St. Louis area, which had a special contract with the utility   company, chose to shut down its operations rather than pay a higher   rate for energy. Also, a local chemical firm closed a phosphate and   a textile plant as a result of the coal strike. Earlier this month,   a major automobile assembly plant was expected to shut down due to a   lack of parts as a result of the strike. However, conditions have   apparently improved in areas where the automobile parts are   manufactured and the shutdown is not foreseen at present.
Despite the threat of power cutbacks and bad weather, manufacturing   activity appears to have made modest gains in recent weeks. A   representative from a major chemical firm noted strong sales for   agricultural and industrial chemicals, textiles, and plastics. An   appliance firm representative reported some production losses due to   adverse weather, but that orders were strong, partially reflecting   the strength in homebuilding. Other products showing strong sales   include paper and boxboard, heating equipment, pharmaceuticals,   clothing, and recreational equipment.
The demand for new homes continues at a high level. Bad weather,   however, has hampered construction work, and some lengthening in   order backlogs for new homes has resulted. The backlog of new home   orders is now estimated to be 60 to 90 days in the St. Louis area.   Most home construction continues to be of the single-family type. In   Memphis, the vacancy rates on apartments, which was very high in   1975 and 1976, are now reported to be falling rapidly, but rents   have not adjusted upward sufficiently to encourage apartment   construction.
The dollar volume of commercial and industrial loans at larger   District banks has increased sharply in recent weeks. The volume of   real estate, consumer, and agricultural loans has been growing   rapidly for more than a year. Mortgage loan demand is reported to be   excellent at savings and loan associations, reflecting the large   amount of construction. Time and savings deposits registered sizable   gains at commercial banks and savings and loan associations, but S   and L's report gains are somewhat below those registered in 1977.   Interest rates on most types of loans have remained generally   unchanged from a month ago. Recently, a constitutional amendment was   passed by the Tennessee voters which removed the 10 percent interest   rate maximum from the state's constitution and placed the power to   set usury ceilings with the legislature. This limit has been an   important factor in reducing the availability of credit in the state   and in the relatively low earnings of some Tennessee banks during   years of relatively high market interest rates.
