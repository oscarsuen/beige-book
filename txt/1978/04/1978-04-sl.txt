Business managers in the Eighth District report that economic   activity has increased in recent weeks. Retailers in St. Louis noted   that sales began to improve around mid-March, and the excess   inventories built up earlier in the year are expected to be worked   off in the next few weeks. Construction activity has increased   sharply with the improved weather conditions. Home sales remain at a   relatively high level. Manufacturing activity has also gained   momentum with the settlement of the coal strike. In the financial   sector, net saving inflows into savings and loan associations have   slowed further in recent weeks and with continued strong demand for   mortgage loans, interest rates have moved up. In the agricultural   sector, field work is somewhat behind schedule, but this is not a   serious problem at this time of year.
According to area retailers, sales picked up strength around mid-  March, after a relatively severe winter slump. A major St. Louis   department store representative reported that March sales were about   5 percent above a year ago, and that the sales were accelerating in   the last half of the month. Inventories are excessive in some soft   goods items, but the excess is expected to be worked off within a   few weeks. While some retailers were fairly optimistic about sales   in the next few months, others remain apprehensive about the future   course of consumer spending. One representative noted that fear of   inflation by consumers may inhibit their spending while another   observed that consumers are nervous and seem only willing to buy at   special sale events.
Construction work has accelerated in recent weeks as weather   conditions have improved. Order backlogs for new homes remain at a   high level and new orders continue to come in at a brisk pace. With   the large backlog of orders as well as the new orders expected,   builders look forward to a high level of construction activity this   year.
Manufacturing activity apparently has picked up some momentum in a   number of industries recently. One major manufacturer of appliances   and capital goods reported improvement in sales throughout its line   of products in the past month. Also, a major chemical firm reported   overall improvement in sales in March, with strong sales for   agricultural chemicals, phosphates, and plastics. A steel industry   representative reported that orders on the books for the second   quarter are very strong, especially from capital goods firms, and   that overall steel shipments are estimated to be up from last year's   level. It was pointed out, however, that world wide, the steel   industry is suffering from excess capacity. A representative of the   paint and coatings industry reported very strong sales in recent   months, up 15 percent from a year ago, and that a strong second   quarter is expected for this industry. Production in this industry   is near capacity. A firm making connector plates used in   construction reported poor sales early this year, but that sales   recovered nicely in March and are expected to make up for the early   1978 losses later in the year. Other firms reporting strong business   activity included manufacturers of air filtration equipment,   lighting fixtures, and cutting tools.
Savings and loan institutions reported some further slowing in net   deposit inflows during recent weeks from the January-February   levels. Gross inflows of deposits continue at a relatively high   level, but withdrawals have increased, leaving smaller gains in net   savings. S and L's are increasing nonprice competition for funds by   boosting advertising budgets and premium offerings. Representatives   of the industry point out that 4-year certificates, first offered   about 4 years ago, are now subject to withdrawal and these funds are   beginning to move into alternative investments. Counter to the   experience of the S and L's, total time deposits at large commercial   banks in the District have continued to increase in recent weeks.
With the demand for home mortgages continuing quite strong, and with   slowing in savings growth, interest rates have risen further. The   prevailing mortgage rate in the St. Louis and Memphis areas is now 9   percent for an 80 percent loan. Not only are loan rates increasing   but in some cases more rigorous loan policies are being implemented.   Some institutions now require prospective mortgage customers to hold   savings at their institution before being granted a loan. One S and   L representative reported a reluctance to make new loans or loan   commitments at current interest rates since he believed that rates   will go higher in the near future. Demand for most other types of   loans also remains at a high level. Commercial banks reported large   increases in commercial and industrial loans in March, and the  demand for farm loans continues up from the very high levels of a   year ago.
