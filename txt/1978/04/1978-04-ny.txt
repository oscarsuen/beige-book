In other sectors of the District economy, the pace of business activity seems to have picked up in recent weeks. Indeed, there are widespread reports of sizable gains in new orders for manufactured intermediate goodsâ€”ranging from paper to forged iron and steel to machine tools. This could be an advance indicator of a speedup in the recovery of the District economy. It seems likely, however, that some part of these recent gains in orders is simply the result of the resumption of normal business patterns following the end of the prolonged coal strike and the unusually severe winter weather. In any event, the overall tenor of the responses suggests that the outlook for capital spending remains cautious. Business loan demand at large New York City banks has yet to show any sustained strength. Senior lending personnel at five large New York City banks were queried concerning the reasons for this phenomenon. All five respondents emphasized the importance of corporate liquidity of large firms that have experienced strong cash flow and, with fresh memories of credit stringency in 1973-74, have secured long-term financing unusually far ahead of anticipated needs. Looking at various competitive sources of funds, there were mixed opinions as to the quantitative importance of Eurodollar borrowing by large multinational customers. One respondent cited heightened competition from the commercial paper market, while two stated that they had not seen increased competition from that source lately. There were also mixed perceptions of the importance of competition for large customers from regional banks, with three respondents claiming more aggressive regional competition while two others did not rate it a very important factor. Among less publicized factors, two respondents cited competition for term loans from insurance companies, while another reported stiffer competition from finance companies. All respondents indicated that an acceleration in capital spending would certainly help loan demand, although they differed concerning the relative significance of this versus competitive and liquidity factors. Personnel at the two banks doing an appreciable amount of local business lending observed that loan demand by smaller Second District customers was stronger than that of the large national firms.
