Economic activity in the Ninth District continues to improve, but   there is a growing uneasiness over wage and price increases. The   encouraging economic signals evident last month still show up in   retail spending, labor market conditions, and loan demand. However,   directors believe inflationary expectations have been revised   upward, although no significant changes in inventory accumulation,   investment plans, or capital goods sales have occurred yet. Most   directors think that the coal settlement will set the tone for   subsequent labor negotiations here.
According to our recent surveys, retail sales are doing well, and   retailers are fairly optimistic. Most auto distributors in the   region report that sales in March were ahead of last year, with   full-size and subcompact models both selling briskly. Dealer   inventories are adequate but could become tight for certain "hot-sellers" by summer. Retailers of other goods also are pleased with   current sales, report no serious inventory difficulties, and expect   a good summer season. Resort owners report that inquiries and   reservations are up from last year; they expect an excellent summer   too. No gasoline shortages are showing up; in fact, prices have   dropped in Montana and South Dakota.
Reflecting strength in manufacturing and homebuilding, the   district's unemployment rate has improved dramatically in recent   months. Seasonally adjusted unemployment for the first two months of   the year averaged 4.5 percent, compared to 5.2 percent in the fourth   quarter of 1977 and 5.6 percent a year ago. Although the labor force   increased 4 percent over the past twelve months, jobs increased at a   5.5 percent rate. As a result, the number of people looking for work   declined 17 percent. Substantial increases in the help wanted   advertising index and reductions in initial claims for unemployment   compensation both suggest no deterioration in joblessness in the   next few months.
District loan demand has been strong again this year, and banks have   been responding in several ways. Some apparently are selling off   some loans; others are raising interest rates and tightening other   credit terms. Large city banks, however, which are experiencing   strong business borrowing, seem to be slightly easing price and   nonprice terms on those loans.
Heavy demand is expected for all types of loans this year, according   to directors. Agricultural bankers who may have been reluctant to   lend last year expect ag lending to pick up this year in response to   recent improvements in grain and livestock prices.
One large regional bank in the Twin Cities is currently showing good   increases in all major loan categories but expects some slowing this   year in two types of loans. It thinks consumer loan growth may slow   as consumer's debt repayment schedules become more burdensome and   real estate loan growth may slow as interest rates rise and mortgage   credit tightens.
The major concern in the district right now is inflation. Almost all   respondents report that businesses have revised inflationary   expectations upward. Food price increases, higher import costs due   to a weakened dollar, and increased unit labor costs are all cited   as reasons for this revision.
The revised inflation expectations have not yet shown up in business   actions, however. A few isolated examples of inventory accumulation   exist, but there is no evidence of widespread attempts to increase   inventories in order to beat future price increases. In fact,   several respondents noted that businesses, apparently fearing a   slowdown later this year, are very cautious about increasing   inventories now. Similarly, inflation has not caused cautious   businesses to change investment plans, although one respondent   suggested that business spending plans appear to have been revised   upward because of economic strength in the fourth quarter.
Most respondents believe that general price increases plus the coal   settlement and the increase in the minimum wage will push up wage   demands in this area. They think governmental pleas for voluntary   restraint will probably be disregarded since the Administration had   a major role in the coal settlement. Those who do not see any   immediate wage consequences from the coal settlement expect it to   set a pattern for wage negotiations in future years.
