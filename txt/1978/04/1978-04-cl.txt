Officials and economists have not changed their forecasts that the increase in real capital spending this year will at best equal last year's increase. One official described his company's position for 1978 as still cautious. He attributed this to ample capacity, memories of high debt and low liquidity during the last recession, Government safety regulations and his company's phasing out a 25 million dollar investment for a new automotive product. Recovery in medium trucks used especially by small businesses is still well below peaks reached in 1973, and inventories are judged to be ample because sales have fallen short of expectations. Machine tool builders, however, have become more optimistic following a peak in new orders last quarter and further gains are expected this quarter. One builder said backlogs for some highly technical lines have expanded to 85 weeks compared with 50-60 weeks a few months ago. They are operating near 90 percent of capacity. Housing starts are expected to recover sharply from weather- depressed activity earlier this year. Last quarter's losses should be recouped this quarter. Some S&Ls claim demand for loans is even stronger than last summer because some banks appear to be less interested in mortgage lending than they have been. Mortgage rates have risen 1/4 to 1/2 point since March. To attract funds, a few S&Ls have instituted continuous compounding of interest on all deposits. Several report that they do not plan to limit mortgage lending in coming months, despite slowed growth in deposit flows, which, for some institutions, strengthened in late March and early April. Liquidity at some associations has fallen to reserve requirement limits. In view of tightening cash flows, a few are no longer writing loans for new customers or for multiple dwellings and are not lending to marginal builders. Some S&Ls also have eliminated 95 percent loans.
