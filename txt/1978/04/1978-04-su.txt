Reports from the twelve District Banks this month unanimously   indicate an expanding economy. The effects of a severe winter appear   to have been largely overcome, and economic activity in the regions   affected by the now-settled coal strike has returned to normal   levels. Retail sales are generally strong, as is the manufacturing   sector. Crop prospects for this year are good, but spring planting   is reported to be behind schedule, a result of the harsh winter   weather. Construction activity is strong overall. Mortgage demand is   maintaining its strength, but business loan demand is mixed. The   fear of accelerating inflation is pervasive, and is seen as a major   stumbling block to continued real growth.
Retail sales are a major source of strength in the renewed   expansion, according to this month's reports. Boston and Cleveland   observe some softness in this sector, but virtually all of the other   Districts indicate a strong up-tick this month. Chicago notes that   big-ticket items are the best sellers. In addition to gains in   department store sales, automobile purchases are also reported to be   up substantially. This, however, stems partly from suppressed demand   in the first quarter.
Expansion in the goods-producing industries is evident in all   Districts with a sizable manufacturing sector. Durable goods   industries are particularly strong. Capital goods production is said   to be on the upswing in Boston, New York, and Chicago, while   Richmond indicates consumer goods output to be strong also.   Improvement in the steel industry is cited across the board, a   result of both the surprisingly effective trigger-price system,   instituted by the Administration earlier this year, and a generally   rising demand for steel in recent months.
Construction activity is generally strong in April. Atlanta and   Cleveland report optimism among builders that 1978 will be a good   year for housing. Nonresidential construction is expected to fill   any gap that may occur in the housing market later this year.   Chicago, on the other hand, expects commercial and industrial   construction to lead the way, and housing starts to decline.
Economic conditions in the agricultural sector are favorable. Kansas   City, Atlanta, and Richmond all report stronger farm prices, and   farm income is projected to increase in 1978. Adverse weather   conditions have delayed spring planting to some degree, but this is   not thought to be a serious setback.
In the banking sector, District reports show business borrowing to   be mixed this month. Minneapolis, Richmond, and Boston say demand   for C&I loans is strong, while New York and Philadelphia banks show   softness. Future loan demand projections are no less varied. At the   same time, deposit growth in most Districts is slack. Although cash   flows are said to be tightening in some areas, disintermediation   doesn't appear to be a major cause for concern at this time. The   mortgage market is reported to be generally tight. San Francisco and   Cleveland say some S&Ls are now refusing mortgages on certain types   of dwellings. Mortgage rates have risen recently and now stand in   the 9 1/4 - 9 3/4 percent range.
Several Districts commented on the widespread fear of accelerating   inflation in the near future. Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and   Atlanta all indicate concern among businessmen about a higher rate   of price inflation later this year. Higher price increases are   deemed a deterrent to both consumer and business confidence, and   therefore to continued economic expansion. Moreover, half of the   District reports indicate that inflation is, in fact, expected to   heat up as we move into the second half of 1978. One reason for the   upward revision of price forecasts is the coal settlement. As   Chicago points out, many consider the pact to be inflationary in   itself, and expect it to set the tone for labor negotiations in the   future. Other factors feeding the fires of inflation are recent  steel price hikes and utility rate increases.
