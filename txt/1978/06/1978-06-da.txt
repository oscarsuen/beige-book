Directors and businessmen interviewed this month report further   advances in Eleventh District economic activity. Initial response by   the public to the new six-month time certificates has been   favorable, although initial sales were less than expected. Banks and   thrift institutions see the new certificates as an effective way of   retaining current savings. Material shortages continue to cause   bottlenecks in construction activity in the district. Labor remains   in tight supply and is constraining production in some industries.   Retail sales are posting strong gains, but retailers attribute some   of the strength to advance buying by customers. Manufacturing   activity continues to expand, but there are signs of slowdowns in   new orders in some industries.
In response to an advertising blitz in newspapers and on radio and   television, public interest in the new six-month time certificates   has been heavy, but sales during the first week of issue were   somewhat short of expectations. S&Ls appear to be marketing the new   time certificates more vigorously than banks. In fact, some large   banks have made only minimal efforts toward selling the   certificates. Maximum allowable interest rates are being offered at   compounded rates by most of the banks and S&Ls surveyed, and nearly   a third of the new issues sold represent inflows of new savings.   Banks that are not advertising the new certificates are finding that   a much smaller percentage represents new savings inflows.
Banks and thrift institutions have reduced advertising during the   second week of issue and plan to resume heavy advertising only when   they begin to lose deposits. Bankers, in particular, are reluctant   to make the new time certificates an important source of funds, as   most expressed satisfaction with their current liquidity position   and see the new certificates as adding to the cost of funds without   providing additional benefits. But these banks feel compelled to   offer the new certificates to remain competitive with other   institutions whose currently weak liquidity positions warrant   issuing the new certificates. S&Ls pressed by continuing strong   mortgage demand and declining savings inflows, find the new   certificates more attractive than banks. The increased ability to   retain savings, plus drawing in additional savings, appear to offset   the added costs of funds in the judgments of the majority of S&L   executives surveyed.
Banks and S&Ls agree that the money going into the new certificates   is highly interest-rate sensitive. Several respondents predict money   market rates will decline late in the third quarter and the new   certificates will play only a minor role in savings flows by next   year.
The strong pace of economic activity in the district has produced   relatively few shortages or bottlenecks. Most of the material   shortages continue to be in the construction industry. The shortage   of cement is acute, and available supplies of concrete are being   allocated to customers and Monday deliveries have been discontinued.   The price of concrete in Dallas is currently $35 a yard, up from $30   in January, and is expected to rise to $40 a yard by the end of the   year. Shortages of sand, gravel, sheetrock, and insulation have also   lengthened the time required to complete some projects. Most of the   shortages faced by the construction industry have existed for   several months now, and construction firms have coped with them   through careful planning and ordering materials well ahead of   schedule.
Labor shortages persist in construction and other industries.   Welders, machinists, and mechanics are reported in short supply by   fabricated steel producers, oil field equipment makers, and   shipbuilders. Shortages of adequately qualified unskilled labor are   also frequently reported by employers, especially in Dallas and   Houston.
The only equipment shortage of note is for drilling rigs. A shortage   of rail cars, especially hopper cars, continues to slow deliveries   of some agricultural and manufactured products, but the railroads   say the problem is only temporary.
Retail sales are "excellent" and are running slightly ahead of   expectations according to department store executives. Apparel sales   at many outlets have been sufficiently strong this quarter to offset   the first quarter's poor performance. However, some executives   attribute much of the increase in department store sales to advance   buying prompted by prospects of higher prices. Many retailers   believe that the current strength in sales will not carry over into   the second half of the year, largely because of the high and rapidly   rising level of consumer debt, and year-to-year sales gains will   begin to slow in coming months. Inventories at stores are currently   near desired levels.
Manufacturing output continues to expand, but some industries report   a softening in new orders. Bookings for fabricated steel buildings   are slowing because many small businesses are having difficulty   securing mortgage money to make these purchases. Fabricated metal   manufacturers, however, continue to operate at full capacity and   still have large backlogs of orders.
There is widespread feeling, especially among the directors of this   bank, that prices are rising much faster than the WPI and CPI   suggest. With prices of many goods rising very sharply, it is   difficult to discern what commodity prices are rising at slower   rates than the overall indexes.
