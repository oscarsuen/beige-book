Fourth District economists who met recently at this Bank expect that   the expansion will continue at least into the first half of 1979   unless economic policies become restrictive. Auto producers remain   optimistic over sales prospects for that industry although some   retailers expect a sharp slowing in consumer spending next half.   Only scattered signs of bottlenecks and shortages are reported,   despite operating rates in some key industries approaching effective   capacity. Though bankers are satisfied with consumer response to the   six-month savings certificates, the bulk of certificates represents   a shift of funds from existing deposits rather than new money.
Twenty-five economists attending the bank meeting on the economic   outlook slightly scaled down expectations for growth in output but   raised them for inflation this year. The median forecast of the   group indicated second-half gains in real GNP at about a 3.5 percent   annual rate, followed by a 2.5 percent annual rate of increase in   the first half of 1979. They expect the rate of inflation to   increase by about a 6.5 percent annual rate from the third quarter   of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979 and moderate to 6.1 percent in   the second quarter of 1979. While the expansion is expected to   continue into 1979, one economist forecasts a mild decline for two   successive quarters during the first half of 1979 and three of the   group expect either no growth or a small decline in early 1979,   followed by a pickup the second quarter.
Expectations for consumer spending are mixed. An economist with a   major automotive producer expects that total auto sales this year   will amount to 11.3 million units and moderate to about a 10.8   million annual rate during the first half of 1979. He explained that   consumer installment repayments relative to disposable income are   not high by historical standards and that consumers have been using   capital gains in housing to help finance purchases. New car sales   have held up longer and at a higher rate than he expected in part   because of prebuying in anticipation of rising prices and the belief   that 1978 models represent the last of the big cars. A less   optimistic viewpoint was expressed by an economist with a major   national department store chain. He expects considerable slowing in  the pace of consumer spending during the second half of 1978. A   further gradual pickup in the personal saving rate, continued high   rates of inflation at about a 7.5 percent annual rate by the end of   this year, and an expansion of consumer installment debt are   expected to contribute to a reduced rate of spending.
Economists expect generally that the rate of increase in fixed   investment over the coming four quarters will be about the same as   in the past four quarters. Some pointed out that orders in their   industries, including heavy-duty trucks, printing and communication,   and electrical equipment, are no longer accelerating, even though   the volume of orders is well above a year earlier. Machine tool   orders this year are well above a year earlier but are not   accelerating. However, one economist expects larger gains in fixed   investment over the next four quarters because commercial and other   nonmanufacturing building contracts have been rising rapidly.
Officials and economists report only scattered shortages of labor,   plant capacity, or materials, although operating rates are at or   near effective capacity in a number of key industries, including   primary metals, machine tools, building materials, and paper and   paperboard. While shortages are not widespread, backlogs have been   rising and delivery schedules have been lengthening in several   industries.
Most shortages are in construction, particularly for insulating   materials and drywall. There are complaints of railcoal car   shortages. A capital goods producer complained about extended   delivery in machine tools hindered his company's expansion program.   Despite scattered shortages, several economists caution that demand   and price pressures can surface anywhere along a supply schedule and   not necessarily when operating rates are at capacity. Production of   paper is at capacity and paperboard operations are at about 98   percent of effective capacity, but no shortages of labor and   materials are reported. Some auto producers are operating above   capacity on popular models without bottlenecks.
Others caution that effective productive capacity is often different   from published capacity. For the past month, steel has been   operating at about 92 percent of effective capacity, a level that   approaches full capacity because a higher operating rate would   require violation of environmental regulations. A major aluminum   producer also has been operating virtually at capacity. On the other   hand, a major producer of fiberglass insulation is operating at 105   percent of capacity and expects to operate at full capacity at least   until additional new capacity becomes available later this year. He   points out that the 600 additional suppliers of cellulose since the   end of 1977 are providing new capacity for insulating materials. But   the relevance of this capacity is unknown since government standards   on insulation are being tightened.
Public response to the new savings certificates was rather mixed,   according to officials with major district banks. S&Ls appear to   have promoted the certificates more aggressively than the banks.   Generally, all ten banks contacted are offering six-month   certificates at maximum rates, with a few compounding daily and the   others compounding monthly or quarterly. All banks are offering   maximum rates on eight-year certificates. Some are compounding   quarterly for deposits of $5,000 or less and others monthly for   deposits exceeding $5,000. All but two of the banks described their   advertising as heavy, but some feel their programs are not as   aggressive as S&Ls. Consumer response to the six-month certificate   is described as very good or favorable by most banks. On the other   hand, response to the eight-year certificate has been slow. Still,   one of the largest district banks reported that the eight-year CDs   made up about 20 percent of its total volume of certificates.   Bankers do not plan to change their promotional programs, except for   one bank that indicates that after the June 30 interest payment date   they will more aggressively promote six-month certificates. Only two   banks reported that the bulk of the certificate sales represented   new money. Some of the largest banks state that as much as 75   percent to 90 percent of funds obtained represented a shift from   existing deposits. Most bankers feel the new certificates will not   do much to improve the net flow of deposits over the next six   months.
