Our district's economic news has been good lately, and most   observers think it will stay that way in spite of tightness in a few   input markets. Business has been brisk and should remain so for   manufacturers, farmers, retailers, and builders throughout the   district. But growing rightness in skilled labor and home mortgage   markets threatens to put the squeeze on some area businesspeople,   most notably homebuilders. The seriousness of that threat is   difficult to assess, though, as the impact of recent Regulation Q   changes on the supply of credit is still doubtful.
Sales by farmers have also been higher than last year. Cash crop   receipts for our district through April were about 17 percent higher   than the corresponding period last year. Cash livestock receipts   were up 15 percent.
Rural retailers serving those farmers as well as the retailers   serving their city cousins have enjoyed strong sales activity.   Directors indicated that rural consumer spending has been strongest   in western Montana, western South Dakota, and Wisconsin, where the   profitable livestock and dairy businesses are concentrated. Retail   sales outlets in urban areas throughout the district have posted   very good sales figures in recent weeks.
Durable goods have been particularly big sellers. Automobile sales   have been unusually good. And home buying has continued to be a   favorite pastime of our district's consumers.
Homebuilding has picked up too. It was off to a slow start in   January and February, but recent reports suggest this industry has   resumed last year's record pace. This resurgence together with   mounting commercial building demand has pushed construction   employment in the district to an all-time high.
In addition, farmers have gotten their crops in on time, and recent   weather has been favorable. So most observers are predicting good   harvests in the district. Furthermore, since the majority of   district farmers have signed up for the government acreage set-aside   program, they will be eligible for federal crop price supports. And   livestock producers, though disappointed over the relaxation of meat   import barriers, still expect a good year.
Our directors also project continued high levels of retail sales   through the summer.
Homebuilders are bearing the brunt of the higher prices generated in   these tightening markets. Construction costs are rising rapidly, and   mortgage interest rates are poised to pierce the 10 percent barrier.
Our Bank's directors fear a substantial slide in the quantity of new   homes demanded as these factors continue to push monthly home-ownership payments higher.
It's not clear how much the tight credit situation will be eased by   the recent changes in Regulation Q, either. While most district   banks and thrifts offered the new six-month CDs at the ceiling   rates, less than half of those surveyed (almost all located in urban   areas) were actively promoting sales of these instruments. And while   promotion of the CDs increased their sales, most banks and thrifts   thought little net deposit gain would result from those sales. The   high state income tax rate in Minnesota and exemption of T-bill   interest from those taxes led some bankers to suggest that banks and   thrifts in that state would continue to find it hard to compete with   government debt instruments for investor funds.
