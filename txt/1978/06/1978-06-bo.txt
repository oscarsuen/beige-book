A.	All but one are offering the maximum rate and that one is a cooperative bank in Rhode Island paying the auction rate plus one-eighth. B.	Around one-half of the larger institutions are advertising heavily. C.	Heavy advertisers generally had good inflows. Savings banks with the higher rate generally had relatively better inflows than commercial banks. D.	Those with good inflows report that one-half or more is outside money, while among the others very little is outside money. E.	Respondents generally are not very enthusiastic about future prospects. After the initial flurry, they think inflows will taper off. Respondents think this money is expensive and they are apprehensive about the future, fearing that bill rates may rise to eight or nine percent. Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, and Samuelson were available for comment this month. They all agreed that the recent surge in consumer prices does not imply an increase in the underlying "hardcore" inflation rate. Further, none of the three believed the acceleration to be the result of widespread "excess demand." Eckstein noted that the rate of price advance is no worse than was previously expected, while both Houthakker and Samuelson felt that they would require more confirming evidence than they have yet seen before concluding that unemployment has reached its natural rate or that full capacity output has been achieved. All respondents favored the maintenance of the current posture of monetary policy. Eckstein believes that no further policy changes should be attempted until incoming data reveal the effect of earlier rounds of tightening on the economy. In his view, current policy seems to be producing the desired effects—witness the deceleration in the rate of money growth and the increase in mortgage rates—so that it would be a mistake for the Fed to use up all of its "margin for movement" at the present time. He expects a slowdown in the economy to begin in August or September due to declining housing starts as disintermediation intensifies and weak consumption spending as households reduce excessive debt burdens. According to Samuelson, current policy should aim at avoiding less than 3 percent real growth in 1979. He feels that a "preventive growth recession" is not necessarily desirable, and therefore urges the Fed to "dig in its heels" to prevent a too rapid tightening of credit markets. Houthakker agrees that current monetary policy is appropriate, although he would like to see it accompanied by a substantial reduction in the Federal budget deficit.
