Directors and other Red Book respondents of the Federal Reserve Bank   of Boston report strong economic growth which they expect to   continue throughout the year. One pattern that emerged clearly is   that while many executives are worried about the economy as a whole,   their own businesses are doing very well; several respondents gave   the opinion that the published data are not reflecting the true   strength of the economy. Commercial and industrial loan demand is   growing strongly and production and employment in the First District   are up. Retail sales remain healthy although some concern has been   expressed about the future. Tightness is reported in the market for   skilled labor in the electronics industry and shortages of some   types of aluminum are expected later this year.
The chief economist of a large electrical equipment manufacturer   reports very strong demand in both consumer and industrial markets.   This company's domestic capital goods orders are up by about 25   percent over last year and major appliances and other consumer   durables are also doing very well. A Connecticut director reports   that manufacturers across the state are experiencing very strong   growth in orders and sales. This pattern was also reflected in the   comments of directors from other parts of the region. The Chairman   of the Board of a local department store chain reports continued   strong sales although he is highly concerned about the impact of   inflation on consumer sentiment later this year. Retail inventories   are somewhat higher than desirable although they are not a cause of   great concern at this point. Loan demand continues to be very strong   in the northern New England states and is also improving at the   large Boston banks.
A recently completed survey of small businesses across New England   indicates that many are planning price increases and several have   had substantial wage settlements in the last few months. All of   those participating in the Red Book calls expressed great concern   about inflation. Several Massachusetts electronics companies   reported shortages of skilled technicians, electrical engineers and   other technical professionals. A large manufacturer of aircraft   components expects shortages of aluminum to develop next year and   also reports difficulties in finding machinists in some locations.   However, this bank's survey of potential bottlenecks indicated that   widespread shortages or capacity problems are not expected.
A survey conducted to obtain the requested information on the new   six-month time certificate found that practically all but the   smallest commercial and savings banks are offering the new   certificate. But about one-fifth of the cooperative banks (small   state-chartered savings and loan associations) in Massachusetts are   reported offering them.
A.	All but one are offering the maximum rate and that one is a   cooperative bank in Rhode Island paying the auction rate plus one-eighth.
B.	Around one-half of the larger institutions are advertising   heavily.
C.	Heavy advertisers generally had good inflows. Savings banks   with the higher rate generally had relatively better inflows than   commercial banks.
D.	Those with good inflows report that one-half or more is   outside money, while among the others very little is outside money.
E.	Respondents generally are not very enthusiastic about future   prospects. After the initial flurry, they think inflows will taper   off. Respondents think this money is expensive and they are   apprehensive about the future, fearing that bill rates may rise to   eight or nine percent.
Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, and Samuelson were available for   comment this month. They all agreed that the recent surge in   consumer prices does not imply an increase in the underlying "hardcore" inflation rate. Further, none of the three believed the   acceleration to be the result of widespread "excess demand." Eckstein noted that the rate of price advance is no worse than was   previously expected, while both Houthakker and Samuelson felt that   they would require more confirming evidence than they have yet seen   before concluding that unemployment has reached its natural rate or   that full capacity output has been achieved.
All respondents favored the maintenance of the current posture of   monetary policy. Eckstein believes that no further policy changes   should be attempted until incoming data reveal the effect of earlier   rounds of tightening on the economy. In his view, current policy   seems to be producing the desired effects—witness the deceleration   in the rate of money growth and the increase in mortgage rates—so   that it would be a mistake for the Fed to use up all of its "margin   for movement" at the present time. He expects a slowdown in the   economy to begin in August or September due to declining housing   starts as disintermediation intensifies and weak consumption   spending as households reduce excessive debt burdens. According to   Samuelson, current policy should aim at avoiding less than 3 percent   real growth in 1979. He feels that a "preventive growth recession"   is not necessarily desirable, and therefore urges the Fed to "dig in   its heels" to prevent a too rapid tightening of credit markets.   Houthakker agrees that current monetary policy is appropriate,   although he would like to see it accompanied by a substantial   reduction in the Federal budget deficit.
