Retail sales, especially those of domestic autos, continue strong.   High cattle prices are stimulating farm incomes. The forest products   industry is booming and reports a serious shortage of railroad cars   to deliver its product. Except for California, the Twelfth District   is characterized by full employment. Bankers are generally   unenthusiastic about the six-month certificates and consumer   response at banks has been very modest.
Retail sales continue strong in the west. One Oregon observer notes   that nominal sales are increasing at 15 percent annual rates. A   survey in Tacoma, Washington, sees sales rising at an 8 percent   annual rate. In Seattle, domestic auto sales are reported strong,   but sales of imports are down sharply due to buyer resistance to   price increases. In southern California, sales of most cars are said   to be booming, but especially those of such luxury cars as Cadillac   and Mercedes. New car sales are also reported strong in Utah.
In the agricultural sector, high cattle prices are reported to be   bolstering farm incomes throughout the district, but there is some   concern about Administration hints of raising the imported beef   quota. Even though fruit and vegetable prices have been rising, good   California weather is expected to flatten these out. Concern is   expressed that current farm-land prices in California are not   justified by the land's productive capacity, but rather by its value   as an asset for foreign investors fleeing inflation or domestic   investors seeking tax shelters.
The forest products industry is reported to be quite strong due.   both to strong export demand and an expanding residential   construction sector. There are, however, two major concerns in this   industry. The first is that high mortgage rates (now 10 percent and   expected by some to move to 11 percent) could pull the rug out from   under housing sales and thus lumber sales. The second concern is   over a serious shortage of railroad cars to get forest products out   of the northwestâ€”one observer claimed that the need is for 50   percent more cars than are currently available. A director who   produces railroad cars confirmed this reported shortage by noting   that his factories were experiencing tremendous backlogs.
In southern California the construction business (especially   nonresidential) is still booming, though there is growing concern   over rising costs of labor and materials. One director in the   construction business claimed that rapidly rising wages accompanied   by falling productivity (due to low and falling unemployment rates)   had generated a 27 percent increase in labor costs over the past   year.
Our directors were asked whether they felt that their local areas   were characterized by full employment or whether there were   involuntarily unemployed people who could be absorbed by a rapidly   expanding economy. All western directors outside California   portrayed their local economies as having a fully employed labor   force. The Utah economy was said to be devouring a stream of new   workers migrating into the area. In the Portland area, it was   observed that there were virtually no skilled workers available, and   this shortage of skilled workers was echoed throughout the district.   The categories of unemployment still existing (i.e., students   seeking summer jobs, migrant workers, some unskilled workers and   central-city teenagers) were cited as not being amenable to   reduction through a more rapidly expanding economy. On the other   hand, six of our eight California directors felt that California was   not yet near full employment. A dean at the University of Southern   California notes that they are receiving hundreds of requests for   interviews for both academic and staff positions. Several directors   noted that California will move even farther away from full   employment in the short run due to the public-sector layoffs   stimulated by the passage of the Jarvis-Gann initiative (which cut   property taxes by 60 percent).
Our banker directors were generally unenthusiastic about the new   six-month certificate. The general feeling seems to be that: a)   banks cannot compete with thrifts in this market due to the 114   percent differential and b) most purchases of certificates will be   simply internal shifts anyway. All are offering the certificates at   the T-bill rate. Only slightly more than half of the banks appear to   be advertising the certificates, and most of this advertising seems   to be of a minimal nature. Consumer response so far seems negligible   to modest, though one Alaskan and one Washington bank did report   favorable response. Practically all of the certificate purchases (80   to 100 percent) involved internal shifts of funds. The only   exception was the Alaskan bank for which 45 percent of the   certificates were new business. Most felt the certificates would   have only a modest impact over the next six months, and generally   that they would help to curtail outflows of funds rather than   actually generate any new inflows. One director felt the only effect   would be to raise the cost of funds and thus lower earnings.
