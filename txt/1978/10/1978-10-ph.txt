Indications from the Third District are that current business   conditions are good overall. Continued growth in the industrial   sector and expanding employment are being reported. For the longer   term though, manufacturers expect the economy to slip somewhat.   Retail sales are mixed for the second month in a row, causing some   merchants to believe the pace of consumer expenditures may finally   be slowing down. Sales forecasts for the next two quarters are   varied. Area bankers say business and consumer loan demand remains   strong in October and look for slow and steady growth through early   1979. Interest rates are rising and are expected to peak in the   first quarter. Although no serious disintermediation has been   observed, bankers are concerned that it may become a problem in the   future.
Manufacturers responding to the October Business Outlook Survey say   the industrial sector continues to expand at about the same pace as   last month. Supporting this claim, Survey respondents indicate   higher levels of new orders and shipments and fractional growth of   inventories. The continued expansion has given local employment a   boost for the eighth consecutive month, with substantially larger   payrolls reported in October as well as a marginally longer   workweek.
Looking ahead six months, manufacturers continue to foresee a   worsening of the business climate. Nearly one-third of the   respondents this month expect a decline in general economic activity   by the end of the first quarter. Consequently, new orders and   shipments are projected to remain at their current levels and a   fractional trimming of inventories is planned. Factory work forces   are expected to hold their current levels over the period but a   slight decline in the length of the average workweek is planned. A   Director of this Bank, whose business is in the manufacturing   sector, takes issue with the view that a turndown is imminent. His   business is currently strong, and he sees no recession until at   least 1980.
On the price front, over half of those surveyed this month report   paying higher prices for raw materials, while less than one-third   are charging more for their finished products. For the longer term,   80 percent of the respondents foresee continued increases in the   cost of inputs, and 57 percent plan to hike the prices of the goods   they sell.
Reports of current dollar sales range from "just about even" to 14   percent above year-ago levels. Retailers at the lower end of the   range say their sales are slightly below planned volume while for   those at the upper end, sales are about 3 percent over anticipated   levels. Inventories are reported to be in good shape. Contacts at   the stores experiencing sluggishness in October cite several causes   for the poor performance including uncertainty among consumers about   the strength of the economy and the possibility that "the consumer   may finally be reaching the end of his credit rope." It should also   be noted that sales volume last year at this time was extremely   high, making large gains this year difficult.
Looking ahead to the next six months, local merchants have widely   varying expectations. Although some are fairly optimistic and look   for first quarter sales to be as much as 11 percent higher than   year-earlier levels, others are more conservative in their   projections and expect to simply match early 1978 volume. None of   the retailers contacted has assumed a tax cut in his forecast.
Local bankers say loan demand remains generally strong this month.   Consumer loans continue to grow and C&I loans are reported to be 1   to 7 percent over year-end figures. Business loan demand is slightly   ahead of planned levels overall. Bankers contacted say they have   seen the underlying demand for business loans grow slowly and   steadily over the past several months, so that unconventional loans   are less necessary. As for the future, bankers look for continued   strength in loan demand over the next two quarters. One contact   feels that part of this continuing demand growth will come from the   retailing sector. This person anticipates a slowdown in retail sales   in the near future and, as a result, an increased demand for funds   as retailers find it necessary to finance excessive inventories.
The prime rate at all of the banks contacted in October is 9 3/4   percent. Interest rates are expected to rise again in the near   future, and to continue their climb through the first quarter of   next year. All bankers contacted expect to see a prime of at least   10 percent by year-end, and a first quarter average of 10 or 10 1/4   percent. They look for a peak early in 1979 that could go as high as   11 percent.
Higher interest rates appear to have begun to take their toll on   deposit flows. Although no one contacted sees a serious   disintermediation problem yet, bankers are worried about a slow but   accelerating runoff in time and savings deposits. The variable-rate   money market certificate is mentioned as a primary force in   counteracting possible deposit erosion as a result of high interest   rates.
