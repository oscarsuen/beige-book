Reports of current dollar sales range from "just about even" to 14 percent above year-ago levels. Retailers at the lower end of the range say their sales are slightly below planned volume while for those at the upper end, sales are about 3 percent over anticipated levels. Inventories are reported to be in good shape. Contacts at the stores experiencing sluggishness in October cite several causes for the poor performance including uncertainty among consumers about the strength of the economy and the possibility that "the consumer may finally be reaching the end of his credit rope." It should also be noted that sales volume last year at this time was extremely high, making large gains this year difficult. Looking ahead to the next six months, local merchants have widely varying expectations. Although some are fairly optimistic and look for first quarter sales to be as much as 11 percent higher than year-earlier levels, others are more conservative in their projections and expect to simply match early 1978 volume. None of the retailers contacted has assumed a tax cut in his forecast. Local bankers say loan demand remains generally strong this month. Consumer loans continue to grow and C&I loans are reported to be 1 to 7 percent over year-end figures. Business loan demand is slightly ahead of planned levels overall. Bankers contacted say they have seen the underlying demand for business loans grow slowly and steadily over the past several months, so that unconventional loans are less necessary. As for the future, bankers look for continued strength in loan demand over the next two quarters. One contact feels that part of this continuing demand growth will come from the retailing sector. This person anticipates a slowdown in retail sales in the near future and, as a result, an increased demand for funds as retailers find it necessary to finance excessive inventories. The prime rate at all of the banks contacted in October is 9 3/4 percent. Interest rates are expected to rise again in the near future, and to continue their climb through the first quarter of next year. All bankers contacted expect to see a prime of at least 10 percent by year-end, and a first quarter average of 10 or 10 1/4 percent. They look for a peak early in 1979 that could go as high as 11 percent. Higher interest rates appear to have begun to take their toll on deposit flows. Although no one contacted sees a serious disintermediation problem yet, bankers are worried about a slow but accelerating runoff in time and savings deposits. The variable-rate money market certificate is mentioned as a primary force in counteracting possible deposit erosion as a result of high interest rates.
