At their most recent meeting several Directors of the Boston Bank   remarked that their own Roundtable discussion of business trends was   becoming monotonous because of little change in their view of   economic conditions. Directors and other Red Book respondents report   continued healthy but not rapid economic growth with retail sales,   employment, and commercial loan demand all doing nicely. Although   there is no evidence of widespread shortages, certain labor markets   are becoming quite tight and there are reports of stretch outs in   delivery times of certain materials.
A Vermont banker reports that loan demand is very strong in his   state and that he is beginning to have to turn customers away. This   bank expects credit conditions to become considerably tighter and is   making plans for rationing available funds. A large Boston bank   reports that while commercial loan demand increased very strongly   earlier in the year there was some slowdown in August. The chief   executive officer of this bank believes that the August slowdown was   only a temporary reduction in the longer term growth trend. He   indicates that the bank has considerable liquid resources overseas   and expects to be able to meet the anticipated increase in loan   demand with no difficulty. Overall deposit flows remain fairly   strong, although there is some evidence of disintermediation in   savings and NOW accounts.
A local manufacturing conglomerate reports some slowdown in the   sales of its household appliances subsidiary and expects a leveling   off later this year as a result of the anticipated drop in new   housing activity. A division of this corporation which produces   auto-related products is expected to see strong sales throughout the   remainder of this year and well into 1979. A chemical manufacturer   also reports that sales to tire producers have retained strong   momentum.
An executive of a diversified local retailer indicates that sales   across most merchandise lines remain very strong and that she would   be very optimistic except for hearing continual forecasts for a   slowdown. The chief executive of a large dry goods chain reports   that although sales remain strong and above his firm's plan, he is   somewhat concerned about inventories. While his stores do not have   serious inventory overhang, it is higher than desirable and some   adjustment will be necessary. He feels this pattern is also the case   for other retailers, as well as for some manufacturers.
Although no Red Book respondents reported significant production   problems as a result of an inability to obtain materials or labor,   there are signs of a general tightening. A monthly survey of New   England purchasing managers found some difficulty in obtaining   certain types of steel and aluminum as well as electronic   components. The operator of an employment agency reports increased   difficulty in finding people. Similarly a Connecticut director   indicates that many labor markets in that state are becoming   increasingly tight because of expanded manufacturing activity, much   of it defense oriented.
Professors Eckstein, Houtakker, Samuelson and Solow were available   for comment this month. With the exception of Houtakker, none sees   any justification for further interest rate increases at this time.   The majority argued that the Fed must allow for the lags in the   monetary control process by waiting for evidence of the impact of   past rate increases before pushing rates up further. While there was   general agreement among the respondents that a more stringent   voluntary wage and price control program is unlikely to have a   significant effect on the rate of inflation, opinion was divided on   whether such a policy should even be attempted. Solow feels that it   could be marginally successful if properly applied, but Houtakker   worries about its effects on the resource allocation mechanism and  Samuelson fears it might induce a round of preemptive wage and price   increases.
According to Eckstein, the recent figures suggest that the economy   is passing through a phase of the credit cycle that in the past has   always preceded a credit crunch. Events are unfolding more slowly   than usual this time, but he warns that the present calm on the   money markets need not persist. Eckstein believes that rates are   already high enough to greatly increase the risks of a crunch due to   an exogenous shock to the system, so the Fed must be cautious about   increasing rates still further at the present time.
Houthakker argues that the growth of the money supply has yet to   show any evidence of restraint. As a result, he feels that the Fed   is still accommodating inflation. Houthakker is dubious about the   effectiveness of wage and price guidelines, noting that inflation   cannot be reduced by a policy that suppresses competition. He finds   the August foreign trade figures  most heartening, especially the strong growth in exports. It is   Houtakker's view that with the depreciation now showing up   significantly in the trade data, it is possible that the dollar has   finally bottomed out.
Concerned that the Fed has been "painted into a corner" by its   emphasis on money growth targets, Samuelson urges the Fed to allow   some slippage in the money supply rather than risk a needless   recession. He thinks that an appropriate policy is to aim at no less   than 3 percent real growth, but that the recent interest rate   increases may prevent such an outcome next year. Samuelson is   critical of those advocates of incomes policies who see them as an   excuse for another dose of "wild cats" fiscal and monetary stimulus.
Less critical of voluntary controls than the others, Solow believes   that a set of wage and price guidelines is worth trying. However,   since he expects the program's effectiveness to be directly   proportional to the President's commitment to it, Solow feels that   guidelines would prove harmful if announced and subsequently   ignored. With respect to interest rates, Solow can see no   justification for the recent increases, and is disappointed with the   Fed's continued fixation on M1, despite the wide range of   uncertainty surrounding the causes of its movements.
