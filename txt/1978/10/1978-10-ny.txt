Business activity continued to advance in September at a moderate   pace, according to recent comments of directors and other business   leaders. Retail sales turned in a respectable performance despite   the newspaper strike, and retailers seem to be guardedly optimistic   about their prospects for the rest of the year. Elsewhere in the   regional economy, business activity appears to be advancing nicely.   While most respondents appear satisfied with current and near-term   sales, businessmen are still keeping a tight rein on inventories.   Indeed, in some cases, inventories reportedly are so lean that they   have resulted in some stretching of delivery schedules. Looking   ahead, there is an emerging consensus among respondents that the   pace of business activity will slow down next year. Capital spending   is expected to hold up while consumers become more tight-fisted. The   recent firming in business loan demand at the New York City banks is   also expected to continue.
Retail sales in the Second District chalked up healthy gains in   September. Merchants in New York City reported that their sales were   running slightly ahead of last year's pace. They felt that sales   would have been even higher had it not been for the city's ongoing   newspaper strike. Especially hard .hit by the strike have been the   sales of big-ticket durable goods, since they depend more heavily on   advertised sales-promotions than do other consumer goods. Also,   stores in Manhattan have been the ones most affected by the strike.   Elsewhere in the Second District, and especially in New Jersey,   retail sales have been fairly strong across a broad line of goods.   Neither retailers nor bankers professed to be worried about the   much-publicized buildup of consumers' indebtedness. Almost without   exception, the delinquency rates on consumer loans are reportedly   remaining at comfortably low levels; and most consumer creditors   feel that their customers are currently managing their debts quite   well.
Business loan demand in the Second District is expected to retain   its recent strength according to a survey of loan officers and   economists at major New York commercial banks. The respondents were   generally optimistic concerning the near-term business loan outlook   despite rises in interest rates and competition from U. S. offices   of foreign banks. All respondents confirmed receiving "spillover"   loan demand from regional banks which primarily took the form of   loan participations. There was disagreement to what extent these   referrals reflect the increasingly "loaned up" positions on the part   of the regionals or the size of individual loans that sometimes are   too large for a single regional bank to handle for either legal or   policy reasons. In any case, respondents assigned varying degrees of   importance to spillover loans in boosting New York loan demand.
