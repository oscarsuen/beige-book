Business activity continued to advance in September at a moderate   pace, according to recent comments of directors and other business   leaders. Retail sales turned in a respectable performance despite   the newspaper strike, and retailers seem to be guardedly optimistic   about their prospects for the rest of the year. Elsewhere in the   regional economy, business activity appears to be advancing nicely.   While most respondents appear satisfied with current and near-term   sales, businessmen are still keeping a tight rein on inventories.   Indeed, in some cases, inventories reportedly are so lean that they   have resulted in some stretching of delivery schedules. Looking   ahead, there is an emerging consensus among respondents that the   pace of business activity will slow down next year. Capital spending   is expected to hold up while consumers become more tight-fisted. The   recent firming in business loan demand at the New York City banks is   also expected to continue.
Retail sales in the Second District chalked up healthy gains in   September. Merchants in New York City reported that their sales were   running slightly ahead of last year's pace. They felt that sales   would have been even higher had it not been for the city's ongoing   newspaper strike. Especially hard .hit by the strike have been the   sales of big-ticket durable goods, since they depend more heavily on   advertised sales-promotions than do other consumer goods. Also,   stores in Manhattan have been the ones most affected by the strike.   Elsewhere in the Second District, and especially in New Jersey,   retail sales have been fairly strong across a broad line of goods.   Neither retailers nor bankers professed to be worried about the   much-publicized buildup of consumers' indebtedness. Almost without   exception, the delinquency rates on consumer loans are reportedly   remaining at comfortably low levels; and most consumer creditors   feel that their customers are currently managing their debts quite   well.
Outside of retailing, business activity appears to be advancing at a   moderately brisk pace. Most businessmen who were contacted echoed   the assessment of one upstate manufacturer of machine tools that   business was "good" and there were "...no clouds hanging over the   economy—except for inflation." Many businessmen feel that what is   needed in the fight against inflation is a comprehensive and   well-coordinated program. At the same time, they are also very disturbed     about the proliferation of government rules and regulations, which     result in nonproductive costs and delays. In any event, while there     are no apparent shortages in materials, some producers appear to be     nearing the limits of capacity. Nevertheless, virtually none of the     directors or businessmen contacted anticipated a material change in     the pace of capital spending. For example, one upstate manufacturer     indicated that his firm was now bumping up against capacity ceilings     for both brass and aluminum mill products, but does not plan to     expand plant and equipment outlays at this time. When asked about     the economic outlook for the next year and a half, most respondents     foresee a slowdown in the rate of economic growth for the first half     of 1979—but not an outright recession. As a rule, this projected     slowdown is seen as the result of belt-tightening by consumers, with     little attendant change in the rate of capital spending.
Business loan demand in the Second District is expected to retain   its recent strength according to a survey of loan officers and   economists at major New York commercial banks. The respondents were   generally optimistic concerning the near-term business loan outlook   despite rises in interest rates and competition from U. S. offices   of foreign banks. All respondents confirmed receiving "spillover"   loan demand from regional banks which primarily took the form of   loan participations. There was disagreement to what extent these   referrals reflect the increasingly "loaned up" positions on the part   of the regionals or the size of individual loans that sometimes are   too large for a single regional bank to handle for either legal or   policy reasons. In any case, respondents assigned varying degrees of   importance to spillover loans in boosting New York loan demand.
The majority of respondents gave optimistic forecasts of loan growth   through the first half of 1979. All those questioned said that   increases in interest rates have not yet affected loan demand.   Everyone acknowledged loan competition by   U.S. agencies and   branches of foreign banks. However, some uncertainty was voiced   concerning how much of this business was with traditional customers   and whether the loans to nontraditional customers were similar in   quality to those loans usually made to large domestic firms.
