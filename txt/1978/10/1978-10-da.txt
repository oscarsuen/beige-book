The Directors and businessmen surveyed this month report no   significant change in the strong pace of economic activity in the   Eleventh District. Auto and department store sales continue to grow.   Low inventory levels have limited new car sales somewhat, although   inventories at department stores are more than ample. Manufacturing   activity also remains strong, and construction of new plants and   expansions is well ahead of a year ago. Loan demand at both banks   and savings and loan associations appears to have slowed from the   peak rates recorded earlier this year, while deposit inflows   continue to grow moderately. Our October survey of agribankers   indicates funds available for farm loans are in short supply.
Auto sales are up across the District and could be even better if   dealer inventories of 1978 models were larger. Bargain hunting for   1978 cars is on the rise, but early sales of the 1979 models are   strong. Several dealers also note that used car sales have picked up   recently in response to higher new car prices.
Department store sales remain 12 to 14 percent ahead of a year ago.   Many merchants, however, appear overly optimistic as to prospects   for sales, and excess inventories have developed at a large number   of stores. Several stores are using promotional efforts to reduce   excess inventories. Others, however, appear willing to carry heavier   than normal fall inventories into the Christmas season. Much of the   strength in department store sales at the present time is centered   in sportswear and sporting equipment. Other goods selling well   include home furnishings and appliances.
High production levels remain the norm for the manufacturing firms   surveyed, but many respondents expect a significant slowing in   business next year. Higher materials and labor costs and declining   productivity continue to be cited as major problems, but they have   not had any visible impact on output. In fact, the District's   industrial base continues to expand. An electric utility, for   example, reports that there were more new plants and expansions   constructed in its service area during the first eight months of   this year than for all of last year. Much of the growth is in the   electronics, oil field equipment, and auto-related industries. While   several large chemical plants are under construction, some plant   expansions have been delayed in light of the large amount of new   capacity coming on stream.
The boom in oil and gas drilling activity continues in the District,   but the current surplus of natural gas in the Texas intrastate   market has reduced the number of active rigs in South Texas. The   current high level of activity has produced numerous equipment   shortages including drill pipe. A major oil field equipment   manufacturer reports that a shortage of cobalt used in alloyed steel   products is developing.
Industry sources describe production of petrochemicals as "good."   One respondent, however, indicated output may have peaked during the   second quarter and expects a moderate decline in sales and continued   soft prices. Benzene is the only major chemical that is in "extremely" short supply.
Lending activity of District banks appears to have settled back to a   moderate rate of expansion compared to the record rates of growth in   the first half of the year. With liquidity levels high at most   banks, loan officers are becoming more aggressive in seeking out new   borrowers. In the face of rising interest rates, however, bankers   are particularly eager to make short-term loans. But many expect   interest rates to peak in the next few months, and some indicate   that they may begin moving into long-term contracts in the near   future. Total deposits at most banks continue to grow slowly,   although demand deposits declined slightly in conjunction with the   September 15 tax payment date.
Mortgage lending by S&Ls remains strong but has backed off from the   frantic pace experienced several months ago. A further gradual   slowing in mortgage demand is expected. Savings inflows continued to   grow at a moderate rate in September, but inflows remained below   year-earlier levels. Insurance company and foreign money are   reported to be available in large amounts for real estate financing   and purchases.
Preliminary findings from our October survey of agribankers indicate   that funds available for farm loans are in short supply and that few   bankers are actively seeking new agricultural loan accounts.   Interest rates for all categories of farm loans have climbed rapidly   in recent months with the general rise in interest rates and with   expanded demands for feeder cattle and operating loans. Financial   conditions in the livestock sector are much improved from a year   ago. However, crop farmers are in a much worse position than last   year as much needed rains arrived too late to raise yields to normal   levels in many areas.
