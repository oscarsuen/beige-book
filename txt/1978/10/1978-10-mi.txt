No significant changes in either the economic or financial condition   of the Ninth District were observed this month. The vital signs of   the region are favorable, and respondents to this month's Redbook   inquiry are basically optimistic. Inflation continues as the major   economic concern, since current interest rates are doing little to   slow loan demand.
Throughout the district, industrial production is characterized as "reasonably favorable" to "very good." A gradual slowing of growth   rates is expected, in part because comparisons are now being made   with months which were very good last year.
The heady pace of residential construction has moderated slightly as   compared with last year. But commercial construction activity   remains hectic.
Ag production is proceeding nicely this year. Record small grain   crops are reported in North Dakota. The excellent yields and higher   ag commodity prices, especially for livestock and dairy, should   improve farm incomes this year. Grain hauling was somewhat impeded   by the rail strike, but this was not a serious problem.
Inventories are characterized as "normal" to "manageable," and   virtually no one is seeing any buildup. Our observers consider an   inventory induced turndown very unlikely because of the conservative   stocking policies being followed by area businesses.
There are still some reports of cement shortages, but the problem is   not as acute as it was last month.
Retail sales are generally reported as "normal," "good," or "strong" throughout the region. There are spot reports of softness in   nondurables, but big ticket items are strong and auto dealers are   happy. Most observers think retailers are quite optimistic about the   fourth quarter. The improvement in ag earnings is sustaining   implement sales and otherwise boosting economic activity in rural   communities.
Ag banks in the district continue to report heavy loan demand and   little deposit growth. Apparently farm receipts are coming in a bit   late this year. Grain is being put in storage, cattle are not yet   moving in Montana (although some handsome contracts have been   drawn), and set-aside payments haven't been made.
But this situation should change soon, so deposits at rural banks   are expected to show growth in late October and in November. Ag   loans are now being repaid, but expectations of strong loan demand   next year are widespread.
Money market certificates-of-deposit are still selling well   throughout the district. These instruments don't account for a   significant percentage of consumer time deposits here, but they have   helped stem the erosion that was seen earlier this year.
Throughout the district we are hearing reports that loan demand has   not slowed despite high nominal interest rates. With the current   inflationary psychology, borrowers apparently are attempting to stay   ahead of expected price increases.
Big businesses, which cite inflation as the economy's number one   problem, are finding that their low inventory positions are giving   them the liquidity they need to finance internally. It seems   obvious, then, that the nominally high interest rates are not so   high that they pose any kind of threat to district economic   activity.
