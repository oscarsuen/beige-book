Indications from the Third District are that economic activity has   picked up in August. The industrial sector is posting strong gains   after a seasonal slowdown in July, and retailers report current   sales to be well ahead of year-ago levels. For the longer term,   manufacturers expect to hold their ground in terms of sales between   now and February, but project a slight cut in employment. Retailers   on the other hand, look for strong gains to continue throughout the   next six months. Inventories are expected to remain unchanged over   the period. Commercial bankers in the area say business loan demand   is up, but have mixed views about future demand. All banking   contacts expect interest rates to peak within the next six months.
Manufacturers responding to the August Business Outlook Survey say   business is better this month after a seasonal lull in July, with   over one-third of the respondents reporting an improved business   climate in August. Supporting the claims of a pickup, responding   manufacturers say both new orders and shipments are up over last   month's levels. At the same time, factory work forces have grown   fractionally and inventories have declined. A Director of this Bank   agrees with these reports. He claims his business, in the   nondurables manufacturing sector, has been doing well all summer and   continues strong in August.
For the longer term, Survey participants say they expect to maintain   the status quo over the next six months. Consistent with this   projection, local manufacturers foresee only a marginal increase in   new orders between now and February, with no change in the number of   shipments at all. Consequently, businessmen seem to be taking a "wait and see" attitude with regard to business decisions. They plan   to maintain inventories at their current levels and expect to hold   the line on capital spending as well. Although no actual decline in   business volume is anticipated, the lack of bullishness in the   outlook might spell bad news for the local labor force. For the   first time in the current recovery, Survey respondents say they plan   to cut payrolls fractionally, and trim the length of the average   workweek as well.
On the price front, manufacturers again report higher prices in the   industrial sector. Over half of those polled this month report   paying higher prices for raw materials, while about one-fourth say   they're charging more for their finished products. Price increases   are expected to become more prevalent over the next six months, with   77 percent of the executives surveyed projecting higher prices for   inputs and 62 percent planning to hike the prices of the goods they   sell.
Department store executives in the area say sales are very strong in   August, a month that is usually soft. Reports of current dollar   sales range from 8 to 26 percent over year-ago levels and up to 10   percent ahead of plan. This makes the fifth straight month in which   gains have been posted by the local retail sector. Merchants   attribute the continuing strength to several factors including   favorable weather and an effort on the part of consumers to beat   future price hikes by spending now instead of later.
This "buy now" attitude does not seem to be representative of   businessmen with regard to inventories, however. Reports of stock   levels range from "on target" to "a little thick" at this time.   Those merchants with excess inventories expect to reduce their   stocks to desired levels over the next six to eight weeks. Aside   from this, businessmen foresee no changes in inventories (other than   seasonal) between now and February. A Bank Director confirms these   views.
Retail sales forecasts for the next six months vary, but merchants   are generally optimistic. Most of those contacted say they don't   believe that consumers are likely to overextend themselves during   the period. Sales projections for the beginning of 1979 range from 5   to 13 percent over year-earlier levels. Although those at the lower   end of the scale note that their projections for nominal growth   probably imply no teal gains, they point out that year-earlier   levels were extraordinarily high and believe it will be difficult to   top them by a wide margin.
Area bankers say consumer loan demand is mixed but that business   loan demand is up by as much as 8 percent over the same period last   year. The reported levels of C&I loans are generally as planned or   slightly better. As for the future, commercial bankers have mixed   views. Forecasts range from virtually flat loan demand through early   1979 to a gradual pickup and possibly a boom.
The prime rate at all of the banks contacted is currently 9 percent.   All contacts feel interest rates will top out sometime within the   next six months, but differ as to when a peak will occur. Estimates   of the peak prime range from 9 1/4 to 10 1/2 percent, with those   people projecting a later peak at the upper end of the range. None   of the bankers contacted have observed disintermediation at their   institutions and do not consider it to be a potential problem at   this time.
