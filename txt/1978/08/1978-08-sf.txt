In most District states, retail sales are maintaining a 10 percent   margin of increase over last year. Tight control of inventories is   reported to have resulted in some loss of sales. Automobiles   continue to sell well although there is a trend toward higher sales   of domestic intermediates and lower imports in response to the   decline of the dollar. Residential housing starts are declining   throughout District states but nonresidential construction activity   remains high. Demand for real estate is unquenchable but properties   for sale continue in light supply. This summer's crop harvest has   been bountiful and, with prices staying high, farmers have been able   to recoup losses from winter weather damage. Feed lots are again   running into a cost squeeze. An education administrator in Southern   California sees a budget cutback of about 10 percent as a result of   Proposition 13 which will effectively cancel community-oriented   programs like child care centers and reduce the number of evening   classes.
Retail sales continue robust in the Pacific Northwest, Nevada, and   Arizona, but there has been some hesitancy in California as people   try to take measure of Proposition 13. Consumers are uncertain about   its ultimate effects on their paychecks and check-out counter tabs   as well as tax assessments and rents. Nevertheless, in all areas,   domestic automobiles have been selling well with standards currently   outperforming compacts. Sales of imports, especially Japanese   models, are off sharply due to price rises brought on by the decline   in the dollar.
Retail sales of general merchandise are averaging about 10 percent   higher than last year and most areas do not report any deceleration.   In some areas where residential housing has leveled out, there is a   boom in commercial building to house public and private support   services and provide the infrastructure necessary to expanded   communities.
Inventory-sales ratios are reported to be low, a situation which to   a large extent is considered "normal" because of high inventory-carrying costs. However, there is some concern over a possible   recession in the near future and this concern may be influencing   operations. The result of this disposition on all levels of trade is   to keep inventories relatively tight. One Director reported lost   sales as a result of a low inventory policy.
In California, the one-month flurry of residential permit activity   in June reflected a July 1 effective date for new structural energy   requirements which are expected to add 15 percent to building costs.   The basic trend is down, however, as it is throughout most of the   Twelfth District. Real estate activity remains strong, but due to a   lack of properties for sale and the general scarcity of rental   units, the primary result is higher prices. The situation is   exacerbated by the continued conversion of apartments to condominium   units as a result of the threat of rent control, high cost of   maintenance, and a high sales price/rental income ratio in most   areas.
Around Seattle, the economy is experiencing a strong spurt due to   the very large orders received by Boeing Company for its 767   airplane. Income, employment, sales and immigration are experiencing   strong growth. Office space and housing are facing unquenchable   demand which is expected to last at least through the end of this   year.
In agriculture, excellent crops and high prices during the summer   have allowed farmers to recover losses suffered earlier because of   heavy spring rains. Regarding the livestock situation, the price of   fat cattle has fallen, whereas the price of feeder cattle has risen.   This tends to shrink the profit margin for feed lot operations. The   prices of feeder-type grains—barley, oats, etc.—are still $100 a   ton or better. A squeeze on feed lot operators usually precedes   higher prices at the retail counter, as rising feed-lot costs are   ultimately passed on to the consumer. Rising feed-lot costs that   have developed over the past month and one-half are expected to   influence retail prices in the winter.
A director who is a public college administrator in California has   been trying to pin down the effects of Proposition 13 on higher   education in his area. He projects a 15 to 20 percent reduction in   the amount of resources available to his school. Projects such as   child care centers will be eliminated and community service programs   will be reduced to a minimum. Although reduction in over-all classes   will be about 10 percent, most of it will affect part-time or   evening classes. There has been an increase in early retirements   and, since these teachers will be replaced by new lower-paid   employees, the trend provides some budget relief. Teachers have been   canvassed about doubling up on subjects and have been found flexible   but not enthusiastic.
