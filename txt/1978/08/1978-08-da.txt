Directors and businessmen surveyed this month report only minor   changes in the strong rate of growth in economic activity in the   Eleventh District. However, the outlook of the Directors is clearly   pessimistic, as they see the high rate of inflation and tighter   credit conditions leading to a sharp economic slowdown. A recent   slowing in sales appears to have been caused by the oppressive   effect of very hot weather on consumers' buying moods.   Nonresidential construction activity, on the other hand, is   increasing sharply. And home sales remain strong enough to keep   mortgage rates high despite some improvement in savings inflows to   savings and loan associations recently. Manufacturing activity   continues to climb, although it is much less robust than a few   months ago.
Directors of this Bank are of the opinion that a significant slowing   in the national economy is in the offing, although they see the   possibility of a recession as small. They indicate that given the   anemic Government efforts to slow the rate of inflation, the rise in   prices is likely to continue unabated. Interest rates are also   expected to rise further, reducing residential construction activity   and business fixed investment. The regional economy, however, is   expected to fare better than the nation because of the influx of   people and new firms into the Southwest.
Nonresidential construction is the fastest growing sector of the   southwestern economy. Plant expansions and new plant construction by   manufacturers are increasing sharply. Construction of power   stations, public projects, and office buildings are also adding   substantially to total contracts. The amount of office space under   construction in the Dallas area has more than doubled since February   to nearly 6.5 million square feet. Residential construction activity   remains strong, although higher prices and mortgage rates are   cutting into sales of new homes.
The expansion in construction activity is hampered by shortages of   cement, but surprisingly, prices have remained fairly stable.   Recently, one major supplier attempted to raise prices but failed as   other firms refused to follow suite. Imports of cement from Mexico   are easing shortages in some areas, and there are several new cement   plants under construction in Texas. Prices of other building   materials in short supply are responding to the demand pressures.
Demand for real estate and construction loans is leading the rise in   lending activity at commercial banks. Some of the recent real estate   loans were to applicants turning to banks because S&Ls were unable   to meet their requests. Banks are becoming increasingly concerned   about their liquidity positions. Loan volume at District banks is   running well ahead of budgeted levels, and 20- to 30-percent gains   in loan volume from year-ago levels are not uncommon. Substantial   volumes of loans are being "laid off" to banks outside the District.   Deposit growth, on the other hand, has been modest and not nearly   fast enough to keep up with the growing demand for loans.
Deposit inflows to District S&Ls continue to run behind those of a   year earlier, although some pickup in savings inflows was noted   recently. Sales of mortgages in the secondary market are still low,   although some portfolio managers are discounting low-yielding   mortgages in order to replace them with higher-yielding mortgages.   Mortgage demand continues strong, and mortgage rates remain near the   10 percent usury ceiling. Down payments of 25 to 30 percent are   required by some S&Ls in Houston and San Antonio, and other nonrate   requirements remain restrictive. A few S&Ls in the Dallas-Fort   Worth area, however, are finding it necessary to reduce some of   their lending requirements. One major S&L, for example, recently   lengthened its commitment period after finding mortgage demand   weakened beyond its expectations.
Manufacturers continue to complain of rising labor and energy costs.   Most are able to pass these costs on to their customers, but some   industries, such as copper producers, are unable to pass costs on   because of weak demand. One copper company recently announced a   price hike but predicts that copper prices will go down in the   months ahead. Plant utilization in the industry is running between   70 and 75 percent of capacity, and new orders are expected to rise   only moderately. Prospects are much better for other durable goods   industries where backlogs of unfilled orders are increasing, and   expansions in productive capacity are planned. Firms supplying the   construction and drilling industries continue to do well, and sheet   metal firms also report strong sales and a continuing rise in new   orders. Outages of major Gulf Coast refineries have reduced   available gasoline supplies, and as a result, are keeping pressure   on wholesale gasoline prices.
