Redbook participants in the First District are anxious about the   impact of a potential 1979 recession on their own businesses but at   the same time see no concrete evidence that a slowdown will actually   take place. No significant deterioration in economic trends was   noticed over the past month. Loan demand remains healthy and is   growing very strongly in some areas. Several manufacturers report   substantial increases in output and some indicate they are operating   at close to capacity. Retail sales continue to be strong although   not growing as fast as before. Inventories are not generally   considered a problem. No shortages of materials were reported   although some labor markets have tightened considerably.
A Connecticut Director reports strong increases in industrial   activity in that state. Several manufacturers of defense products   including airplanes, helicopters, submarines, and tanks, have   substantial backorders that will occupy them for several years. New   orders for consumer products are also very strong. As a result of   the substantial increases in manufacturing activity large employers   in Connecticut report increased difficulty in obtaining experienced   workers and the need to rely more upon training programs.
A survey of small businesses in New England indicates substantially   expanded manufacturing activity across the region with 80 percent   reporting higher backlogs than a year ago. However, two producers of   consumer durables reported some slowdown in sales of major   appliances and housewares. Both of these firms expect a decrease in   housing starts to have some impact on their sales next year.
A Vermont Director reported very strong increases in loan demand and   the need for his bank to police credit commitments much more   carefully. A large Boston bank reports continued strong, although   not spectacular, loan demand with some leveling off following   expected seasonal patterns. Loan officers at this bank are   forecasting a resumption of loan demand growth this fall and its   Chief Executive Officer expects interest rates to continue to   increase until the end of the year.
First District retailers report that sales remain healthy. Although   some minor adjustments in inventory may be called for no major   corrections are expected. Tourist business across New England has   also been very heavy this season. Several Directors commented that   they have seen some evidence of changes in spending patterns brought   about by the increase in the cost of foreign products and travel.
Professors Houthakker and Samuelson were available for comment this   month. Because the current trend rate of inflation, based on wage   and productivity considerations, is about 8 to 9 percent, Houthakker   does not see a peak in long-term interest rates. He notes that beef   cattle herds are not now being rebuilt, a corrective action will be   necessary to reduce beef prices in the long run. Houthakker is   encouraged, however, by the increases in exports and regards the   June trade figures as not necessarily a fluke." Continued strong   performance would bring greater strength for the dollar with respect   to European currencies but not the yen. On the basis of a recent   visit to Japan, Houthakker found the Japanese have done "nothing" to   remedy their trade imbalance and appear adamant about doing nothing   in the future. Houthakker agrees with the stated monetary target   ranges and hopes they will be met. Although he has traditionally   found Ml the more meaningful aggregate, he has been impressed by the   arguments that it may be losing much of its significance.
Samuelson notes that most forecasts now cluster around a mini-recession view of two or three quarters of real growth of about 2   3/4 percent. He feels 3 percent real growth would be tolerable and   agrees with Chairman Miller that a "preventative recession'' would   not be desirable. The Fed should not cheerfully countenance the   prospect of weaker real growth because that would set into motion   forces that could bring further weakness with little diminutive   effect on inflation. To show a responsible concern for inflation the   Fed must gauge how much of the increase in prices is related to   excessive demand. For a tolerable real performance, GNP will need to   grow at least 10 percent. Because "velocity cannot always save the   bacon," this will require money growth at the top or occasionally   above the current ranges.
