Most district businesses had a good July and, despite short supplies   of construction inputs, the economic outlook for the next few months   is good too. Retail sales, especially of hard goods, held up or   increased throughout the district. Production on and off the farm   maintained a brisk pace. Inventories of most goods remained tight   but adequate. And financial institutions continued to witness strong   demand for credit. But concern over developments in the building   sector persists as a shortage of cement has swelled the list of   scarce construction inputs. Nevertheless, most observers expect   economic conditions in the district to change little during the next   few months.
Our Bank's directors indicated that July retail sales equaled or   surpassed retail sales posted for June in just about every part of   the district. And June was a good month for retailers.
Consumer durables continued to be big sellers. As evidence one   director noted an extremely large July increase in installment   sales. Also automobile and truck dealers were reportedly moving   their stock at very rapid rates.
Our Bank's quarterly survey of agricultural lenders revealed that   farmers have be participating actively in this year's retail   spending spree. Ninety-eight percent of the agricultural bankers   responding to that survey reported that spending by farmers was at   or above last year's level.
The reason farmers have loosened their purse strings is a   substantially improved income situation. Ninety-five percent of   surveyed agricultural lenders said farm earnings were at or above   last year's levels. And Bank director's confirm that finding,   pointing to high livestock, dairy, and poultry prices and somewhat   improved prices for crops.
Farmers and retailers weren't the only businesspeople having a good   summer either. A South Dakota director reported tourism had picked   up rapidly since July 4 and was running ahead of last year. A   Minnesota director said production at his firm was up about 15   percent over last year. And characterizations of industrial activity   by other directors ranged from "good" to "booming."
Even though industrial activity has been brisk, most businesses have   pursued cautious inventory policies. Thus while one Minnesota   director reports some retailers are slightly overstocked and farmers   have large quantities of stored grain, for the most part inventories   are tight but adequate.
One industry finding itself in an extremely tight "inventory" position is the banking industry. The supply of lendable funds at   district banks is barely keeping up with the demand for those funds.   These developments have increased bank earnings at the same time   they have pushed up the price of credit.
As usual concerns over the well-being of the construction industry   have increased with the price of credit. But this month building   businesses have been hit with the additional problem of concrete   shortages. This shortage, which has affected much of the western   U.S., has been exacerbated in our region because equipment failures   shut down a large Montana cement plant. The other major cement plant   serving the western portion of our district, South Dakota's state-  owned facility, is rationing its output amongst customers,   allocating each of them about one-half of the amount it purchased   last year. This has led some builders to turn to Canada for much-  needed supplies.
Production of cement is due to resume shortly in Montana, so   builders can look forward to some relief from the cement shortage.   Also, while tightness in credit markets is likely to persist and   skilled labor markets have been and will probably remain tight as   well, builders have been able to cope ably with those conditions.   .Furthermore, they have large work backlogs to keep them busy   through the summer and into the fall. So the near-term outlook for   construction, the sector which has been the major concern of most   observers, is really pretty good.
The near-term outlook for other sectors is pretty good too.   Directors indicate that retailers are looking forward to strong   back-to-school sales in August, farm income prospects for the rest   of the year are good, the cautious inventory policies that most   retailers and manufacturers have been following should cushion them   in the event of a deterioration in demand, and financial   institutions are likely to continue reaping the benefits of strong   loan demand in the coming months.
