Economic activity continues to advance, according to this month's   district comments. While there is concern in some areas that a   downturn may be in the offing, business activity generally appears   to be strong with little evidence of current weakness. Some   shortages of skilled labor and certain materials have developed, but   building activity and industrial production continue to post healthy   gains. At the same time, capital goods orders are strong, suggesting   that capital spending will expand further. Retail sales generally   remain robust, and inventories appear to be at moderate levels.   Furthermore, higher farm prices and good crop prospects have   improved the outlook for agricultural incomes. Demand for bank   credit appears to be strong and broadly based.
Moderate to strong gains in consumer spending were reported in most   districts, although Cleveland and Dallas experienced some recent   softening. Sales continued to be vigorous in most of the San   Francisco District, but some hesitancy was noted in California in   response to uncertainties about the impact of passage of Proposition   13. Automotive sales were strong in many areas of the country.   Nevertheless, sales were generally not expected to continue at the   current brisk pace. Richmond, for example, reports that at least   part of its strong auto loan demand reflects buying in anticipation   of higher prices.
Retail inventory levels generally appear to be in good balance with   overall sales, although some overstocking in a few lines was noted   by several districts. Major exceptions to this view were New York,   where several merchants expressed concern that stocks were higher   than desired, and Cleveland, where the level of inventories of a   wide range of merchandise is considered high. In general, retailers   appear to be optimistic about the near-term outlook for sales.
Among those districts reporting on building activity, most are   continuing to experience relatively high levels of residential   and/or nonresidential construction. Atlanta reports little or no   slowdown in housing starts or mortgage lending to date, and   nonresidential construction is also at a rapid pace. Housing   activity also remains high in the St. Louis and Cleveland districts   and in the latter, most lenders report no slowing in mortgage   commitments and loan applications. Dallas characterizes   nonresidential construction as the fastest growing sector in its   regional economy and notes that home building is also strong. Faced   with rapid growth, both Dallas and Minneapolis cite shortages of   cement as a constraint on their building activity. Nonresidential   construction remains high in San Francisco though home building has   slowed. A recent spurt in California residential permits reflects   the imposition of more costly energy regulations beginning in July   rather than a pickup in activity. Many of the districts reported   that the new six-month money market time certificate resulted in   better-than-expected deposit flows to thrift institutions. Chicago   and St. Louis note a leveling off of mortgage rates in their areas.
Industrial activity expanded in many areas during July. The volume   of new orders was strong in the Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and   St. Louis Districts, while order backlogs have increased sharply for   transportation equipment in Chicago. A survey in the New England   area indicated that 80 percent of small businesses had higher   backlogs than a year earlier. Manufacturers responding in the   monthly Philadelphia and Richmond surveys also reported gains in   shipments and employment. Boston and Chicago report some industries   operating at or close to capacity. While inventories rose in the   Richmond District in contrast to a decline in Philadelphia, Richmond   manufacturers state that inventories more closely approximate   desired levels than in earlier months. Activity in the steel mills   of the Chicago and Cleveland Districts is reported to be robust.   Chicago steel producers are witnessing the best demand in four years   and orders in Cleveland have been strong due to automotive demand   and some stockpiling in anticipation of an August price hike.
The outlook for continued growth in capital expenditures appears   promising, judging from the reports of districts commenting on   capital spending. Cleveland expects good business fixed investment   ahead based on strong orders in its capital goods industry. At the   same time, producers of machine tools and other capital equipment in   some other districts report strong new orders. Nevertheless, there   were a few reports of continuing caution. For example,   Philadelphia's manufacturers expect to "hold the line" on such   spending.
Prospects for agricultural incomes in much of the country have   brightened considerably. Higher prices for livestock and crops,   along with a good harvest in view have raised farmers expectations.   Chicago contrasted the current farm situation to the dismal   conditions of last winter that prompted a strike. San Francisco says   its farmers are in the process of recouping the losses from the   heavy spring rains. As a result of the improved financial situation,   sales of farm equipment and farm spending in general have risen and   loan repayment problems have declined. However, as Kansas City   notes, continued reduction in beef production together with   liquidation of cattle inventory indicate even higher meat costs for   consumers in the months ahead.
Demand for bank credit was reported strong in most districts. The   source of recent demand appears to be broad based. Business loans   were strong in Philadelphia and St. Louis while Kansas City had   heavy demand for real estate loans and Dallas for real estate and   construction loans. Consumer borrowing was a major source of bank   loan demand in the Richmond and New York areas. Consumers in the   Chicago District also made liberal use of credit. So far, there is   no evidence of an increase in delinquency rates. Minneapolis and   Dallas were the only areas to mention the possibility of a liquidity   problem.
