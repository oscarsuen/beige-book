Business activity in the Eighth District continued to rise in late   1977, and businessmen generally expect further gains in 1978. Retail   sales have registered moderate gains in recent weeks, although   automobile sales by some dealers have been less than expected.   Retail inventories are generally at a "satisfactory" level, but   stocks of some types of cars were reported to be greater than   desired. Home construction and sales continue strong for this time   of year, and overall manufacturing activity is advancing. In the   financial sector loan demand is generally strong. Savings and loan   institutions report inflows of savings are smaller than a year ago,   and with strong demand for home mortgages, mortgage interest rates   are beginning to inch upward.
Consumer spending has continued to advance from year ago levels, and   retailers are generally optimistic about sales prospects for 1978.   On the basis of limited information, St. Louis department stores   made only modest sales gains during the recent Christmas season, but   reports from other areas of the District indicate larger gains than   in the St. Louis area. Durable goods sales are mixed. Home appliance   sales continue up, while automobile sales have leveled off.   Automobile sales have declined in the Memphis area, probably   reflecting a ruling by the Tennessee Supreme Court which limited   interest rates under the state usury law to a 10 percent maximum.
Inventories at the retail level are reported to be "trim." Even at   department stores, where sales gains in the Christmas season were   only modest, inventories are not considered to be a problem.   Inventories of some automobile makes, however, are considered to be   above desired levels. Other manufacturing inventories are generally   in line with expected sales.
Demand is strong for most types of loans, including real estate,   consumer, and agricultural loans. Overall, business loan demand at   commercial banks, however, has not increased much in recent weeks.   In December net inflows of consumer-type savings deposits at banks   and savings and loan associations were well below year ago levels.   However, sizable increases have occurred in large negotiable   certificates of deposit. Upward pressure on home mortgage interest   rates is apparently developing. One large savings and loan   association in the St. Louis area recently increased its lending   rate on an 80 percent loan to 9 percent from the 8-3/4 percent rate   which had prevailed for several months.
Manufacturing activity generally continues to advance. Manufacturing   of building materials, appliances, heating equipment, recreational   equipment, paints and coatings, paper and boxboard, and hospital   supplies are among industries reporting sales gains. A steel   industry representative noted that steel orders have unexpectedly   accelerated in recent weeks, reflecting prospective anti-dumping   measures, and continued overall improvement in steel demand. A major   chemical firm, however, notes mixed sales among its product lines,   and farm equipment sales are reported to be sluggish, reflecting the   relatively low farm incomes of last year.
Home building remains at a high level. Recent home sales in the St.   Louis and Memphis areas were reported to be the largest in several   years for the winter season. Reports from Memphis also indicate a   recovery from the overbuilding which occurred in 1973-74. Due to   strong home sales and sizable backlogs of orders, most builders are   not laying off workers as normally occurs at this time of year.
Fall wheat plantings are estimated to be down substantially in the   District. Wet weather in Missouri last fall hampered planting   operations and wheat acreage was estimated to be off 45 percent from   last year. Wheat acreage is also reported to be down substantially   in Tennessee.
