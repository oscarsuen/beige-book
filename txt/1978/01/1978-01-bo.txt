First District respondents are generally pleased with the present   economic situation. Manufacturers are experiencing growth ranging   from moderate to very strong. Christmas retail sales were very good.   Inventories seem to be under control and the inflation rate appears   to be holding steady. The only negative notes are concern about the   continued weakness of foreign economies and worry over the   possibility of higher short-term interest rates.
Christmas retail sales in the First District were very good. Several   respondents described them as "fantastic." Moreover, indications of   after-Christmas sales are also favorable. The head of a large   department store chain who was previously worried about a widespread   inventory buildup now feels that no substantial inventory correction   will be necessary. The strong Christmas sales enabled retailers to   work off any excess. Consumers also appear to be spending freely on   tourism. The ski industry in northern New England is off to a very   good start. Volumes are well above last year, which was a record.   One banker did report that the demand for consumer retail loans is   tapering off. However, he felt that this was to be expected given   the unusually high volumes of recent months. The demand for auto   loans was flat.
Most manufacturers contacted are continuing to see an increase in   sales. Even in Connecticut where several firms with special problems   had extensive layoffs, manufacturing production was up and   employment held steady. Sales of household products, particularly   small appliances, have been doing well. Auto products have also been   moving briskly and although growth in 1978 is not likely to be as   strong as in 1977 some gains are still expected. A supplier of   capital goods to the chemical industry reported a sharp pick-up in   his order. rate. International prospects, however, are a source of   uncertainty. A chemicals producer expressed concern about the   weakness of the overseas market: recent sales in Europe were very   disappointing.
None of the manufacturers contacted felt that inventories were   likely to be a problem for them. Price increases have been pretty   much as expected and no one foresees any difficulty obtaining   materials or fuel. One manufacturer, however, was quite worried   about short-term interest rates. This firm is a frequent borrower of   working capital, and while they are not experiencing a problem now   they are very concerned about the future.
Commercial banks in the First District report good deposit inflows   although one banker expressed concern about disintermediation should   market rates increase more than another 50 basis points. Consumer   loan demand continues to improve and is expected to be strong   throughout 1978 with bank credit supplying an increasing share of   corporate borrowing.
Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, Samuelson, and Tobin were contacted   this month. All but Tobin expressed reservations about intervention   on behalf of the dollar. Eckstein feels avoiding getting locked into   fixed exchange rates is of singular importance. On the other hand,   when our major creditor, Saudi Arabia, insists that something be   done, token intervention may be a wise near-term political   expedient. Houthakker believes intervention may occasionally be   necessary when market conditions become disorderly as may have been   the case in the early days of the new year. Further intervention,   however, is not necessary and not in the best interests of the   United States. Lower import prices would help meet Germany's and   Japan's concern about inflation and provide them with more elbow   room to pursue expansionary policies.
Although declines in the dollar do contribute to our inflation, the   magnitude of the impact so far is one we can live with. Unlike 1972   and 1973, the rise in the prices of our imports have not been   accompanied by sharp increases in the price of exported goods. Tobin   does not object to short-run intervention to stabilize irrational   day-to-day speculation but does oppose trying to peg the exchange   rate. Tobin doubts that the dollar would be overvalued if Germany   and Japan were operating at reasonable levels of capacity, and   questions whether it is overvalued anyway. Recent declines reflect   portfolio shifts by OPEC investors that have little to do with the   fundamental value of the dollar. A policy which would enhance   confidence in the economic recovery and boost the stock market would   help to restore the capital inflow.
Eckstein believes the long-run monetary growth targets should be   left unchanged. Houthakker urged the Fed to stick to its target   range; stabilizing M1 growth at the 7 percent rate recorded over the   past year would be a satisfactory policy. Tobin reiterated his view   that quantitative targets should be set for GNP, rather than   monetary, growth. Monetary policy should aim at a 10 to 13 percent   growth in nominal GNP.
With the exception of auto sales, Samuelson feels economic data are   favorable. The tax cut proposal will act like a safety netâ€”adjusted   down if the economy proves stronger than expected and augmented if   the economy is weaker. Samuelson is concerned that preoccupation   with the stability of the dollar be used as an excuse of deliberate   acceptance of a growth recession. A real growth target of at least 4   1/2 percent would not create demand pull inflationary pressure.
