Nonautomotive retailers and steel producers in the Fourth District   are increasingly optimistic over sales prospects. Auto suppliers are   skeptical that domestic new car sales will pick up much from recent   rates. Steel production will be boosted this quarter partly because   of price hedge buying. Capital goods producers still expect a good   but not boom year. Continued slow growth in deposit flows is noted   by banks and thrift institutions.
Nonautomotive retailers describe sales during December as excellent   and generally above expectations. Some department store officials   had expected year-over-year gains of 9 to 10 percent, but actually   recorded larger gains. An economist associated with a large   department store chain reported even larger gains for merchandise.   These retailers are increasingly optimistic in view of the sustained   rise in sales since last fall, but also point out that by spring   consumer preferences can again shift from general merchandise to   automobiles. Retailers are also pleased that sizable increases in   sales have pared inventories.
Prospects for new car sales and production are highly uncertain. Two   contrasting scenarios have surfaced: one views the reduced pace of   sales as temporary and associated with down-sizing of intermediate   cars by GMC; the other views the softening as a result of consumer   substitution of other goods for automobiles. According to the   former, as expressed by an economist with a major auto producer,   consumers are either buying smaller GMC cars or are holding on to   their cars a year longer. If sales in January do not pick up, auto   producers will sharply cut back production schedules for the balance   of this quarter. Some GMC auto dealers confirm consumer disinterest   for even the highly popular Oldsmobile Cutlass, which one dealer   described as smaller, lighter and 6 percent lower in price than the   1977 models.
Auto suppliers, especially steel and tire producers, have not   experienced major setbacks in orders from auto producers, except   from Chrysler and AMC. A major tire producer reported, however, that   GMC's January projection of car production this quarter was shaved   100,000 units to 2,485,000 cars. This tire maker has been skeptical   of sales and production projections by auto producers and has pared   the estimate to 2,250,000 million this quarter. They expect total   new car sales of 10.7 million this year and feel a comeback in auto   sales is unlikely because of the ample stock of new cars over the   past few years and the rapid buildup of consumer debt.
The turnaround in steel operations that began last month has   accelerated under the impetus of price hedge buying. The February 1   increase in steel prices caused the bulge in orders for January   deliver. According to one steel economist, orders for February and   March shipments have not fallen as they usually have done after a   price increase. The steel price increases scheduled for February and   March have also had the effect of ending the most recent phase of   steel inventory liquidation. First quarter steel shipments are   expected to increase about 10 percent from the fourth quarter 1977.   Even at this higher level of shipments and production, however,   industry profits will probably be negligible this quarter.   Generally, steel economists were noncommittal about reference   pricing of steel, pending additional information. One executive with   a major steel producer, however, views the announced trigger prices   as low; and an industry economist is skeptical that these prices   will result in much of a rollback in steel imports. Another source   indicated that the talk about reference pricing may have deterred   some users from placing foreign orders beyond the first quarter of   1978. If anything, reference prices are more likely to have an   adverse effect on European steel producers than on the Japanese, who   still have a quality and price advantage over most steel producers.
Capital goods producers expect business this year to be as good or   better than 1977, although there is still little sign that spending   for new plant capacity is accelerating. Exceptions are in   technically oriented industries, such as aerospace and   communications, where producers indicate a sharp step-up in spending   for new capacity. A communications and printing press producer has   been experiencing an order rate of about $1 billion compared with   sales of around $900 million and will boost capital expansion this   year. An aerospace and electronics producer expects to boost capital   spending by 40 percent from last year. On the other hand, a medium-  sized chemical producer reported that they had no additional need   for capacity over the next few years in view of softness in prices,   ample capacity, and completion of expansion programs that were begun   a few years ago. Rubber producers will accelerate capital spending   this year because of need for additional radial tire capacity to   replace obsolete facilities and to improve productivity. A large   machinery producer reported the excavator machinery business is   still slow to recover and that increased orders for machine tools   are replacements for existing inefficient equipment with computer-controlled machinery.
There is no sign of early settlement of the coal strike. More than a   third of the industry in Eastern Kentucky, one of the largest coal   mining centers in the country, is shut down, and about 90 percent of   the mines in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania are down. A   director, who describes the strike as bitter, does not expect a   settlement before mid-February, although there will be growing   pressure to end the strike because pensions funds will be depleted.   Another source associated with a major coal producer expects the   union may drop the right-to-strike issue in return for increased   contributions by mine operators to the health and welfare fund.
Banks and thrift institutions report no signs of disintermediation,   although growth in time deposits and passbook savings accounts has   slowed. A large S&L is concerned that outflows from passbook savings   accounts could occur if yields on 3-month Treasury bills exceed 7   percent. S&Ls have been increasingly active in the secondary   mortgage market to support the high volume of mortgage loans. One   association reported that it sold over $50 million of mortgages in   1977, or 10 percent of its portfolio, in the secondary market.   Lenders, builders, and producers of home maintenance and building   materials continued to be cautiously optimistic over prospects for   new housing starts in 1978. One director expects new starts at 1.8   million units this year.
