Business activity remains mixed in the Second District, according to   directors and business leaders, but the outlook is viewed more   favorably than in recent months. Retailers throughout the region   apparently experienced an excellent holiday season, and their   inventories are now judged at satisfactory levels. Although some   hesitation followed settlement of the two-month selective dock   strike, the outlook for shipping is now characterized as strong.   There are also some scattered reports of increases in capital   spending in the district. Domestic auto sales remain depressed,   however, although some dealers are optimistic that activity could   strengthen considerably in the spring.
Virtually all major retailers contacted in the Second District were   elated over the strength of buying during the holiday season. Sales   at the major department stores apparently at least matched or in   some cases far exceeded expectations, which had already been high.   New York City sales were especially strong, with some outlets   claiming their best holiday performance in at least several years.   While some retailers reported a large amount of discounting and   promotional activity, few indicated that this was more than normal   for the period.
Information on post-holiday sales is sketchy and conflicting. Some   respondents reported that sales were holding up very well in early   January, while others talked of a post-holiday slump. In any case,   all retailers contacted indicated that inventories were now on   target or only slightly above target. None viewed their inventories   as a problem given the volume of business they experienced in   December.
While department store sales have been strong in the district,   according to most respondents, sales of domestically produced autos   continue to be depressed. Dealers report that inventories are not   moving because of price resistance and dissatisfaction with the new   models. However, there appears to be growing optimism among dealers   that this is simply a question of deferred buying, since a spring   upturn is common when there has been a slow winter.
By contrast, foreign auto sales have been very strong, substantially   above last year's level and ahead of all projections. A spokesman   for dealers of a major foreign compact reported that, since the   introduction of the 1978 models, inventories have been insufficient   to meet demand, and there has been a backlog of orders. Although   there has been a sharp increase in price, largely as a result of the   depreciation of the dollar, there is no evidence of any price   resistance as of yet. Instead, customers apparently intend to hold   their newly purchased autos for a longer period of time, As they are   buying more expensive options. These dealers believe former large   car owners are switching to smaller cars but prefer the proven   quality of the foreign models to the unknown performance of the new   domestic small models.
In other sectors of the district economy, respondents also continue   to paint a rather mixed picture. A Buffalo director indicated that   the outlook for the chemical equipment industry is not good. The   situation in the power equipment industry, however, appears brighter   due to the general need for more power plants, but the long time   frame for such construction makes specific predictions difficult.
A spokesman for a metals producer in the district reports that their   copper and brass business is still strong. This is expected to   continue for the next two months and reflects, in part, strikes at   competitors. Although aluminum mill production has been good, demand   for ingots is spotty. Demand for consumer metal products, on the   other hand, is expected to continue to be strong through spring.
A spokesman for an upstate forge reports a mild increase in orders.   He expects a steady level of orders through the first half of the   year with most as replacement orders rather than net investment.   With no expectations of bottlenecks in production capacity or   shortages in labor or materials, he believes 1978 will be a good   year.
The New York telephone company is projecting an increase in volume   above last year's rise, according to one of the directors. He also   indicated that the telephone company is planning to increase   expenditures on new construction by approximately 10 percent over   the 1977 level. Another director reported a substantial increase in   capital spending plans by other companies in the Second District for   1978.
Contrary to initial impressions, the shipping industry in the Second   District did not rebound immediately following settlement of the   selective dock strike at the beginning of December. However, an   executive with a leading steamship company reports that business now   looks good and that his outlook for 1978 is very optimistic.
