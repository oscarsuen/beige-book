Most economic sectors in the Seventh District still appear to be   expanding, and sentiment is generally favorable that growth will   continue into the second half of 1978. Production schedules for   autos and farm equipment have been reduced, however. Retail sales of   general merchandise have been very strong. Inventories are generally   on the slim side. The slow but steady uptrend in total capital   outlays is continuing. Favorable weather, until this week, has   permitted outdoor construction activity to continue later this   winter than last. Mortgage credit terms are tightening moderately.
Virtually all general merchandise retailers report that sales   exceeded optimistic budgets, not only in the Christmas season, but   since Christmas as well. Inventories are "on the slim side. "January "clearance" sales have emphasized special purchases rather than   markdowns of regular stock. Sales of most lines have been at high   levels, with home furnishings, including appliances and furniture,   especially good. Consumers have used credit freely but "with   prudence." A University of Michigan survey showing consumer   confidence "at a two-year low" in December baffles local retail   analysts.
Large retailers expect their selling prices to average somewhat more   than 4 percent higher in 1978, about the same as the rise in 1977,   with soft goods up more than hard goods. Purchasing managers for   industrial and commercial companies expect the prices they pay to   rise 6 to 7 percent on average in 1978, also about the same as in   1977. Prices of some commodities have been held down by stiff   competition. But utility rates are 10 percent or more above year ago   levels, while costs of insurance, transportation, and professional   services probably have increased even more.
Auto companies have been cutting production schedules for the first   quarter. Sales in December were a distinct disappointment,   particularly for the new down-sized intermediates. Sales of heavy   trucks also have slowed.
A number of layoffs have been announced in the district's important   farm equipment industry, with at least one tractor plant closed for   the whole month of January. Sales of farm equipment had been sharply   below year ago levels long before the widely publicized "farmers'   strike."
The December survey of the Milwaukee purchasing managers shows that   46 percent expect their business to be better in the first quarter   than in the fourth quarter, as opposed to only 10 percent who expect   it to be worse. For the second half of 1978, 58 percent see business   better than in the first half, and only 5 percent expect it to be   worse. This is significant because of the heavy emphasis on capital   goods production in the Milwaukee area. Also, a high proportion   report that their companies' capital expenditures will be higher in   1978. Finally, the proportion reporting higher output and orders was   larger in December than in November. Inventories were reduced on   average in both months.
Demand for most types of capital goods has continued in a modest   uptrend. Foreign demand for US equipment has remained sluggish,   however. Among the most confident firms are producers of   sophisticated machine tools, often used in mass production   processes. The auto industry continues to dominate these orders, but   demand from other industries also has improved.
Steel companies expect an improvement in their shipments in the   first quarter because of restrictions on imports, low user   inventories, and further gains in total usage. However, auto   producers probably will reduce their orders for steel. While total   steel imports into the US were up about one-third last year, imports   into the Great Lakes area rose by over three-fourths. Many of the   vessels waiting to exit the Seaway after the scheduled closing date   of December 15 had brought in European steel and had delayed their   sailings as they sought cargoes for the return voyage.
Relatively favorable weather in December and early January permitted   private and public construction projects to continue in a period   when outside work had virtually ceased last winter because of severe   cold and strong winds. Four new office buildings totaling 3.8   million square feet are underway (or soon will be) in Chicago's   Loop, scheduled for completion in 1979. Over 5 million square feet   of office space is said to be vacant in the Loop, but large blocks   of top notch space are not available.
Most housing experts believe that homebuilding will be strong again   this year. Prices are still rising at a 9 to 10 percent pace.   Shortages of materials, particularly insulation and sheetrock, are   not likely to be resolved in 1978. Limited availability of developed   lots, with sewer restrictions a large factor, has held back plans of   some builders. Some of the largest Chicago area S&Ls recently raised   their basic rates on 80 percent home mortgages from 8.75 to 9   percent. Moderate further tightening of rates is expected. Opinions   vary as to whether availability of mortgage funds will limit   construction this year. The main question mark is the extent of   disintermediation, already noted by some lenders.
Permits for apartment units in the Chicago area in 1977 were about   double the level of 1975. Nevertheless, apartments comprised only 34   percent of all units, compared to 58 percent in 1971 and 1972.   Suburbs reporting the largest increases in permits in 1977 are   generally 30 miles or more from the Loop, and often 6 to 7 miles   from public transportation.
