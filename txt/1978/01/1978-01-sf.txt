Retail Christmas sales were up by double digits over last year for   many Western firms. Since these sales were typically larger than   expected, inventories were typically leaner than planned by year   end. An apparent end to the drought is filling both agricultural   reservoirs and mountain ski lifts, both of which were nearly empty   for most of last year. Western firms are still highly liquid and   western banks are comfortably liquid, though there were two reports   of mild disintermediation. Related to the U.S. trade deficit,   concern was expressed over the lack of competitiveness of U.S.   goods.
Christmas sales were higher than expected and end-of-the-year   inventories lower than expected in almost all areas of the district.   Most areas experienced double digit increases in their Christmas   sales over year-ago levels. In the Los Angeles area, sales of   practically all items, except autos, were up 10 to 15 percent over   last year, and this strength has abated only slightly in the post-  Christmas period. A Chamber of Commerce survey of another Southern   California city found this year's Christmas to be selling 17 percent   better than last year's. In Portland, the largest department store   reported a 12 percent increase and a large local chain a 21 percent   increase in Christmas sales. Particular strength was seen in   electronic games, food processors and TV/stereo items, and even   foreign autos were selling nicely in Portland. In Seattle, even  Christmas-week food sales topped last year's level by 20 percent,   according to one large chain. Christmas sales were reported to be   unusually heavy among both large and small retailers in various   parts of Idaho, and Salt Lake City's major retail outlets were   ringing up 12 to 15 percent more sales than a year ago. The only   declines in retail sales were reported on an Oregon Indian   Reservation and in a drought-damaged agricultural part of Idaho.
The unexpectedly high level of sales left unexpectedly lean   inventories. One Southern California city reported shortages in   certain lines of toys, women's clothing and small appliances. One   large Portland store reported that inventories were depleted a full   week to ten days before expected. Lower than planned inventories   were reported in virtually every part of the district. One note of   concern came from a large California banker who characterized the   season as a "credit card Christmas" and feared that optimistic   retailers may restock inventories as if such sales would continue,   while consumers will begin to feel overextended in their debt load   and cut back their spending.
There are reports from the forest products industry that the supply   of raw timber is down because environmental groups have blocked   timber sales from government lands. The end of the drought has put   the Western ski industry back on the road to financial health since   extremely good snows are bringing droves of people to the mountains.   The weather has imparted mixed blessings on California agriculture.   While deepening snowpacks and rising reservoir levels mean more   water for farming in 1978, the hurricane-force winds which ripped   through California's Central Valley on December 20 have reduced   farmers' net income by an estimated 20 million dollars. Up to half   of the damage was confined to avocado losses, but damage was also   reported in vineyards, citrus and almond groves, some field crops,   green houses and irrigation systems.
When asked to comment on press reports of liquidity problems among   banks and non-financial corporations, Twelfth District directors   responded that such reports appeared exaggerated and alarmist. Two   years of strong profit growth combined with modest plant and   equipment expenditures was said to have left corporations in strong   cash positions. Most major forest products firms are able to fund   their planned investments largely through internally generated cash.   There was one report of a firm repurchasing its own stock. Overall,   there was not a single report of a liquidity problem among Twelfth   District firms, and many firms were reported to be in highly liquid   positions. The only liquidity problems appear to be among farmers   who are squeezed between low prices and high costs.
Most banks also report no liquidity problems, though one Salt Lake   City bank hints that strong loan demand may soon spark a rise in   interest rates and two Southern California banks have observed some   disintermediation. In particular, one of these latter banks reported   a 20 percent decline in savings certificate balances between August   1 and mid-December.
Several of our directors commented on the persistent U.S. trade   deficit. Some echoed the prevalent explanation that the lagging   economies of our trading partners were responsible for weak foreign   demand and that our rapid import growth was due to purchases of   foreign oil. A natural gas producer recently turned to Japan for "malleable pipe fittings" because U.S. fittings were of such poor   quality, and for small trucks because the U.S. did not produce an   equivalent product. One banker noted that foreign autos now capture   41 percent of Oregon's new car sales due to their high quality. He   also noted that Oregon capital goods producers are losing their   competitive edge due to government restrictions concerning ecology,   human rights, boycotts and due to relatively non-aggressive action   by U.S. export financing agencies (such as the Export-Import Bank).
