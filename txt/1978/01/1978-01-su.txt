The overall impression that emerges from this month's Current   Economic Comments is one of no significant change over the past   month in the business and financial situation. According to these   reports, retailers in most Districts enjoyed a good to excellent   Christmas selling season, although the sale of domestically produced   autos continued weak. Retail inventories are generally at or even   below desired levels, and manufacturing inventories are in line with   sale expectations. Residential construction remains strong. There   were further, albeit limited, indications of a strengthening of   business plant and equipment expenditures. No significant   disintermediation has developed, although savings inflows apparently   have slowed down. Demand for bank credit, notably consumer loans,   was strong.
Virtually all Districts report a good to excellent Christmas selling   season at non-auto retailers, with business generally exceeding   already high expectations. Sales thus are characterized as "fantastic" by some Boston respondents, and as breaking all records   by Atlanta. A good to excellent selling season is reported by   Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco, New York, and Minneapolis and as   substantially above expectations by Dallas. A number of Districts   report continued brisk sales since Christmas, including Chicago,   Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston and San Francisco. Sluggish auto   sales, however, are reported in about half of the reports. Among   others, Chicago reports December auto sales to have been a distinct   disappointment, while St. Louis and New York also note that such   sales have been less than expected. Auto dealers in the Dallas   District look for sales of the 1978 models to exceed those of the   1977 models, but Cleveland characterizes prospects for new car sales   and production as "highly uncertain". Continued strong sales of   imported cars, however, are noted in Atlanta, Dallas and New York.   Regarding consumer outlay on tourism, a good ski season is reported   by Boston and San Francisco.
The high level of non-auto retail sales has apparently reduced   retail inventories to desired levels, indeed in a number of cases to   below such levels. Boston thus reports that strong Christmas sales   has enabled retailers to work off any excess stocks that may have   developed earlier, while Dallas reports inventory levels to have   been drawn down to low levels at many stores. Similar sentiments are   expressed by respondents in the Cleveland and San Francisco   Districts. Chicago characterizes current retail inventory positions   as on the "slim side", St. Louis as "trim", Minneapolis and New York   as posing no problems, and Philadelphia and Richmond as consistent   with sale expectations. Similarly, according to several reports,   inventories at the manufacturing level are generally well balanced.   Manufacturing respondents in the Kansas District thus reported their   inventories as neither excessive nor inadequate, while Boston   respondents felt inventories were unlikely to create problems.   Philadelphia manufacturers plan to maintain their inventories at   current levels, while St. Louis reports manufacturing inventories   excluding autos to be generally in line with expected sales.   However, the view that inventories are too high is widely held among   manufacturers in the Richmond District.
Residential construction remains strong, according to those reports   that comment on this sector. Atlanta perceives an acceleration in   the pace of such construction, led by single-family units but with   quickening of the rate at which apartment projects are coming on   stream as vacancies dwindle and rents climb. St. Louis reports home   building to be strong, with recent home sales in some areas of the   District the largest in several years for the winter season.   Minneapolis notes that home building in its District has remained   well above the previous record pace of 1972, and is expected to   remain strong in the coming months, while housing experts in the   Chicago District also believe home building will be strong again in   1978.
Regarding business capital outlays, Chicago reports that the demand   for most types of capital goods has continued in a modest uptrend,   and that a majority of purchasing agents in areas heavily   emphasizing capital goods production expect improved conditions this   year. Similarly, capital goods producers in the Cleveland District   expect business to be as good or better this year than in 1977, with   a sharp step-up in capital spending in the aerospace and   communication industries. Respondents in New York and Cleveland note   that currently ample capacity obviates the need for additional   investment in the chemical industry, but Boston reports increased   capital goods orders by that industry. Dallas reports that many oil   field machinery and equipment manufacturers are expanding production   facilities.
No significant change on balance appears to have occurred in   manufacturing output and sales, which in general continued to   advance. An improvement in the steel industry is noted by several   banks, including Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis. Philadelphia   reports that the strike in the coal industry as yet has had little   effect on the District's economy, although Richmond reports the   strike to be a major factor in the District's economy.
On the banking scene, no indications of significant   disintermediation have emerged, although a low or slower rate of   growth in time deposits and passbook saving accounts is noted by   several Banks, including Richmond, Cleveland, St. Louis and Dallas.   Concern was expressed by some respondents, however, that such   disintermediation would occur should money rates rise much further.   The demand for credit continues strong, particularly for consumer   and real estate loans.
