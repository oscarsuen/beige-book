December was a banner month for consumer spending; auto purchases   held up better in the Southeast than in the nation. Banks have   realized strong gains on both sides of the balance sheet, but at   S&Ls, the gap between loans and deposits has widened. Housing demand   continues to climb. Rising agricultural prices have brought some   relief for the farmers' plight, and the strike has had little   impact. Job gains continue despite strikes and layoffs. Businessmen   are relatively optimistic about economic conditions in 1978.
By almost all accounts, December retail sales broke all records and   a brisk buying pace carried through the week after Christmas.   Retailers commonly estimate year-to-year sales gains at 15-20   percent. Two directors commented that luxury items had been moving   particularly well in their areas. One retailer who had been   concerned about his large inventory now complains that inadequate   stocks restrained his sales. Only in the coal-mining areas of   northeast Tennessee did sales fail to show a year-to-year advance.
Sales of new domestic-made cars seem to have held about even with   last year in the last few weeks of 1977. Dealer inventories have   reached "ample" (but below national) levels. Designations of the   best-selling models vary too widely for a neat characterization. In   Jacksonville, a record number of imports were unloaded last month.   Truck sales continue to surge; both Chrysler and Ford recorded all-  time peak truck sales in their southeastern zones last month.
Bank deposit inflows have strengthened after a brief slowing; large-denomination CDs have accounted for much of time deposit growth.   Exceptionally strong gains in bank lending have been broad-based,   inducing some banks to reduce their securities holdings. Stricter   adherence to usury laws has reduced bank earnings in Tennessee.   Mortgage rates at S&Ls have held a pretty even keel, though lending   activity remains heavy. There are indications that sources of funds   are tightening in places: Central Florida S&Ls are advertising   certificates at maximum rates (atypical in that state), and Atlanta   associations are both advertising and offering premiums again.
The pace of residential construction has continued to accelerate   through the off-season, still led by single-family homes. Demand for   existing homes has mounted. Apartment projects are coming on stream   at a quicker but moderate rate as vacancies dwindle and rents climb.
The first round of annual tallies of nonresidential construction   outlays shows surprisingly strong (30-75 percent) gains in some of   the smaller cities. Planning has progressed to the initial stages of   construction on several major industrial projects (representing   several hundred million dollars) announced earlier. On the negative   side, Offshore Power Systems of Jacksonville ordered a 30-day halt   (with possible termination) on $75 million of construction when the   State of New Jersey, its only customer, extended the delivery date   on its order by three years.
Stronger export demand has lifted prices of farm products,   especially grains, improving farm incomes somewhat from badly   depressed levels. Recent loan applications suggest that Mississippi   farmers have maintained their living standards through a disastrous   year, piling up substantial unpaid debts. The effects of the much-publicized farmers' strike have been limited to sporadic   interruptions of marketings. Livestock auctions in Georgia and   Alabama closed briefly. Picketers at meat-packing plants convinced   few truckers to hold their cargoes, but slaughter volume was reduced   temporarily. Late December explosions at several grain storage   facilities are thought to have been caused by unusual atmospheric   conditions, combined with high concentrations of dust, rather than   sabotage.
District employment has risen steadily despite the interruptions of   strikes. Most of the disputes which have troubled the labor scene   for the past few months (including the massive Lockheed strike) have   now been resolved. The coal strike, however, has begun to afflict   retailers, banks, and small coal producers in northeast Tennessee.   The impact of a recent large layoff in central Florida will be more   than offset by new jobs provided by industrial expansion; a new CETA   grant to Mississippi will furnish almost as many new jobs as will be   lost to extensive layoffs by Ingalls Shipyards.
There is no uniform consensus among businessmen or area economists   about the prospects for 1978. Few are totally pessimistic, but most   express some apprehension about inflation, government regulatory   policies, energy developments, and the minimum wage. Tennessee   bankers are particularly concerned with the outcome of a March   constitutional referendum on the usury ceiling. The majority of   business leaders expect the economy to improve at least as rapidly   in 1978 as it did in 1977. They generally anticipate better-than-national growth in their own industries or locations, citing such   potential stimulants as reviving population growth, continuing   housing expansion, rebounding nonresidential investment, and/or   increasing tourist inflows.
