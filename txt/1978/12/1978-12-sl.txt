Business expansion In the Eighth District continues, but at a more   moderate rate than in the first half of the year. According to   reports from retail representatives, consumer spending has slackened   somewhat on the "big ticket" items, while automobile and soft goods   sales continue to register moderate gains. Business inventories have   begun to increase slightly in some sectors, and business loan demand   continues strong. Farmers in the District are enjoying a relatively   profitable year, having produced large crops and receiving higher   average prices than a year ago for commodities sold.
While most retailers remain optimistic about pre-Christmas and early   1979 sales prospects, they report some slowing in sales of home   appliances and other major expenditure items. One major retailer   reported that sales of clothing and other soft goods are "coming   along great", but sales of large home furnishing items were   softening. This trend was also noted at the manufacturing level   where a major manufacturer of small electric motors reported that   sales of such motors to appliance manufacturers had declined. One   major manufacturer of home appliances reported layoffs of some   employees. Nevertheless, sales of automobiles and other consumer   items continue up. One automobile dealer reported that overall sales   in November were above the year-ago level, but that buyers were more   selective than last year as indicated by a larger percent of   customer orders rather than sales off the lot.
Inventories at all levels have apparently increased somewhat. A   representative of a furniture manufacturing plant reported an eight   percent increase in inventories from a year ago; a shoe company   reported some buildup in inventories; and an automobile dealer   reported some excess in inventories, reflecting the larger than   usual special orders from the factory by customers. Nevertheless, no   one contacted expressed a great deal of concern about excessive   inventories. On the other hand, one building contractor reported   some shortages of materials, tools, architects, subcontractors, and   other skilled workers.
Reflecting the continued upswing in business activity, loan demand   at District banks is increasing, furthering upward pressure on   interest rates. A major St. Louis banker reported a strong business   loan demand and rising interest rates; some Little Rock banks are   selling loans to improve liquidity; and some Louisville bankers have   instituted stricter credit standards. A number of smaller banks in   outlying sectors report that they are loaned up.
Interest rates have continued up In the District where usury laws   permit then to rise. Usury laws in Arkansas, Missouri, and Tennessee   were reported to be having adverse impacts on lending activity in   these states. Some disintermediation has occurred In Tennessee   savings and loan associations and St. Louis associations report that   virtually all the increases In their deposits are from the new money   market certificates. Those S&Ls in St. Louis which are advertising   extensively and offering premiums to attract the new CDs report that   they have gained sizable amounts of these funds, whereas those   choosing to limit promotional efforts are experiencing some net   withdrawals of savings capital. Some savings and loan institutions   actively seeking more CD deposits, however, are purchasing higher-yielding large CDs at commercial banks rather than making permanent   mortgage loans.
In the agricultural sector conditions are generally good. Farm   commodity prices are higher than expected, and relatively large   crops were harvested. One representative in Kentucky reported the   tobacco crop to be the best in many years. The soybean and corn   crops were generally good throughout most of the District, and the   harvesting weather was favorable. Prices received for both crops and   livestock products are above those of a year ago, and net incomes of   most farmers are up.
