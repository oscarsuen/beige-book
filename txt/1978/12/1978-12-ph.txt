Indications from the Third District are that local economic activity   is mixed in December. Manufacturers say business conditions have   worsened since last month and have consequently held the line on   hiring. Looking ahead to the first half of 1979, executives in the   industrial sector see business slipping a little further. In the   retail sector, merchants report sluggish sales currently and look   for more of the same over the next two quarters. Unplanned inventory   accumulation is being experienced in some stores, mostly at the   larger, national chains. Area bankers report strong loan demand so   far in December, and look for continued growth next year. Bankers   are in disagreement about the future course of interest rates.
Manufacturers responding to this month's Business Outlook Survey say   business conditions have deteriorated since November. Only 10   percent of the respondents note a pickup in activity at their firms   over the last month, while 28 percent report a decline. This yields   a "net change" of minus 18 percentage pointsâ€”the first major decline   in business activity at firms in the Survey since March 1975.   Supporting the claims of a drop-off in business, respondents report   both new orders and shipments to be down in December. Inventories   are stable after a dip last month. On the employment front, the size   of factory work forces has remained more or less unchanged, while   the workweek has been trimmed slightly.
For the longer term, manufacturers are generally bearish about   future economic conditions. They look for a further slowing of   business activity between now and June, with no change in the level   of new orders and only a fractional increase in shipments.   Consistent with this outlook for production is the forecast of no   growth in the size of factory payrolls over the next two quarters   along with further cuts in the length of the workweek.
A Director of this Bank, whose business is in the manufacturing   sector, agrees that the outlook for 1979 is "shaky." In fact, his   company is budgeting for a recession next year. He sees a downturn   as a virtual certainty and says the only questions are when it will   come and how deep it will be.
Inflation in the industrial sector continues in December. Over 60   percent of the manufacturers polled this month report higher prices   for inputs, while about 30 percent are charging more for their   finished products. As for the future, the executives surveyed look   for price hikes to become more widespread over the next six months.   Eighty-six percent of the respondents expect their costs to go up in   the first half of 1979, and about 65 percent plan to raise the   prices of the goods they sell in that period.
Sales at area department stores are extremely slow so far in   December, but retailers are looking for a big surge to come seven to   ten days before Christmas. Reports of current dollar sales range   from only 3 percent above to 2 percent below December '77 levels,   which means that all merchants contacted have experienced a drop in   constant dollar sales. Current sales volume is generally below   projected figures for this period, even though those projections   were "extremely modest."
Local merchants mention several reasons for sluggish sales this   month, including unseasonably warm weather which has not put   shoppers in the "holiday buying mood" and the possibility that   general uncertainty about the course of the economy over the next   few months is causing consumers to hold on to dollars they might   otherwise spend. Another reason for the poor sales performance might   be that this year's sales are being compared to record levels in   December '77, making it difficult to show much improvement. However,   a Director of this Bank whose business is retailing sees the current   sales slowdown as part of a longer-term trend that started in   October. He expects consumers will continue to reduce spending and   lead the economy into recession next year.
Despite slower than expected sales, inventories at department stores   based in this area are reported to be in good shape. Contacts in the   retail sector indicate that this is not the case in the national   chains where stocks are beginning to accumulate at an unplanned   pace. Merchants at the smaller, local chains say they have been   insulated from unplanned inventory accumulation because they have   more flexibility in buying their merchandise than do managers in the   larger chains, who often make inventory commitments many months in   advance.
Looking ahead to the next six months, most retailers contacted   foresee little improvement in business, with the exception of the   period immediately prior to Christmas. Forecasts of sales between   now and June range from "flat" to 4 percent ahead of year-earlier   levels. Some plans to cut inventories early in 1979 are reported.
Area bankers say that the demand for both consumer and business   loans is generally strong this month. Reports of current C&I loan   volume compared to December '77 levels range from "about even" to 8   1/2 percent ahead. This is generally as expected or a little ahead   of plan for this period. As for the future, contacts in the banking   sector foresee moderate to strong growth in loan demand over the   next six months.
Future interest rates are a matter of some speculation and   disagreement among local bankers. Expectations concerning the timing   of a peak in rates, as well as their actual levels, vary widely. Six   month projections of the prime rate, currently 11 1/2 percent at all   of the banks contacted, range from a climb to 12 percent by early   1979 and then a plateau through June, to a continued rise over the   next two quarters with a prime rate of 13 percent occurring in early   summer.
High interest rates continue to cause some disintermediation at area   banks, but the problem is apparently not serious. At least part of   the outflow of funds from consumer-type time and savings deposits is   being offset by new purchases of 6-month money market certificates.   The certificates are being aggressively promoted currently.   Moreover, a large portion of the certificates first issued in June   and now coming due are reportedly being rolled over, thereby   supplying the banks with a continuing source of funds.
