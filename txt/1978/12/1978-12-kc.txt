Tenth District economic activity continues strong, but with some   signs of less support from consumers and from nonfarm businesses.   Manufacturers are finding supplies adequate to operate at near   capacity levels in most cases. Retailers detect some softening in   sales, but see no cause for alarm. Inventories at retail as well as   at the producer level are considered to be in good shape. Farm real   estate values are rising rapidly with the recovery of farm income   and the prospects for favorable farm product prices. Agricultural   loan demand is strong, but commercial loan demand is weakening.   Bankers expect prime rates to rise further.
Tenth District purchasing agents expect prices of most major inputs   to continue to rise, perhaps at an accelerated rate, in the year   ahead. In recent months, the prices of steel, wood materials, and   jet fuel have increased particularly rapidly. However, buyers in   most industries are not having much trouble obtaining materials.   Some problems with suppliers are being experienced by the machinery   and nonfarm transportation equipment industries. All industries   contacted, except the machinery industry, are operating at close to   full capacity. The furniture industry is having difficulty finding   skilled labor.
Material inventories are at satisfactory levels, except in the   electrical goods industry where they are reported to be excessive.   The airline industry expects to be cutting fuel stocks because of   cash-flow problems arising from increasing fuel costs. Other   industries plan to maintain current inventory levels through the   first quarter of 1979.
Sales by District department stores are reported to be ahead of last   year at this time, but some respondents detect a softening in the   last three months. Sales of fashions, fabrics, and other "wearables" have been quite good recently while hardlines, appliances, and major   ticket items have slowed down. Good weather probably has delayed the   usual winter buying of some seasonal items, say store executives.   While some retailers expect strong sales in the first quarter,   others are less optimistic.
Retailers say their inventory levels may be a shade high, and they   plan some cutbacks in purchases and some increase in promotions.   Still, inventories are said to be in better shape than a year ago,   and stocks are expected to be back into balance by April 1.
Farm real estate values are continuing to rise at a brisk pace in   both the District and the nation as a whole. As of October 1, 1978,   District land values were—depending on the type of farmland in   question—11 to 13 per cent above year-earlier levels, with about   half of this increase occurring during the third quarter. These   increases are very much in line with recent USDA figures on farm   real estate values which, for the year ending November 1, 1978, show   an annual gain of 12 per cent for District states as well as for all   U.S. farmland.
Higher farm incomes, reflecting stronger commodity prices and   increased Government benefits, account for most of the strength in   the farm real estate market. For the nation, net farm income in 1978   is expected to run about 30 per cent above the 1977 level, and it is   clear that net income within the Tenth District will also be up   rather significantly this year. Given the favorable price prospects   for most farm commodities in 1979, together with the outlook for net   farm income, which promises to remain fairly steady, further   increases in land values are likely to occur in 1979. If the land   transfer rate holds up or increases in the period ahead, the demand   for farm real estate loans will remain strong, notwithstanding the   possibility of higher interest rates.
Most bankers in the Tenth District report that loan demand remains   strong. However, some bankers in metropolitan areas-Kansas City,   Denver, and Lincoln-report some softening. Agricultural loans are   particularly strong, according to those banks making them either   directly or through correspondents. Construction loans are generally   up, also. Commercial loans at the larger banks show the most   weakness. Nearly all bankers contacted have prime rates of 11 1/2   per cent, following the lead of the large money center banks. All   expect further increases in the near future. Most bankers do not   expect to have problems meeting future loan demand. However, some   mentioned having higher-than-desired loan-asset ratios, cutting back   on real estate loans, and being more selective in general.
Deposit growth is moderate or down slightly at most banks contacted.   Demand deposits are flat or down slightly at all but a few country   banks. Savings deposits are generally down due to higher interest   rates and shifts into money market CD's. One banker notes, however,   that his savings deposits are up slightly due to automatic   transfers. Time deposits are generally flat or up slightly over a   year ago. Several bankers, who say that they have recently become   more aggressive, report increases in large CD's and money market   CD's. Most bankers believe their demand, time, and savings deposits   will grow no more than moderately in the near future due to rising   interest rates and stiff competition for funds. Bankers who are   aggressively seeking interest-sensitive funds expect continued   inflows of these funds.
