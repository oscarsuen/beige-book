The health of the western economy remains robust, though there are a   few signs of possible weakening. Retail sales continue strong   throughout the District, and the inventory-to-sales ratio continues   lean. While there are still shortages of some construction   materials, the situation has improved with weakening real estate   demand. Declines in orders for heavy equipment and men's clothing   may foreshadow a weakening in economic activity, though no actual   weakening is yet apparent, save in real estate. The money market   certificates have apparently prevented savings outflows, and early   reports indicate a substantial rolling over of these certificates.
Retail sales continue brisk throughout the District. Reports from   Los Angeles note that some department store chains are experiencing   sales close to 20 percent above last year's levels, with particular   strength being seen in soft goods. Some observers attribute this to   consumers spending the money they have saved through the property   tax cut associated with Proposition 13. Southern California is also   experiencing very strong demand for both cars and trucks.
The other side of the brisk sales coin is a continued lean   inventory-to-sales ratio. In California, reports generally suggest   that sales have been a bit more rapid than expected, leaving   inventories a bit smaller than planned. In southern California, in   particular, shortages of both trucks and some imported cars have   been reported. In Washington, one banker noted that "sales are so   brisk, there has been little opportunity for inventories to rise in   relation to sales."
Indeed, some manufacturers have reported difficulty in keeping   production rates high enough to meet demand. A large electronics   manufacturer in Oregon reported orders running 32 percent above a   year ago and noted that it was hard to keep up with this level of   sales. One independent oil producer noted that inventories in the   oil industry are considerably below a year ago.
The chief focus for actual shortages continues to be the   construction industry though the supply situation has improved   somewhat since last month. Cement and drywall materials were noted   to be in particularly short supply. However, as construction   activity slows down, demand for construction materials seems to be   moving much more into balance with supply capacity. Thus, the   previously reported shortages in insulation appear no longer to be a   problem. A food processor did note that there were spot shortages of   corrugated boxes, paper, aluminum foil, and vanilla beans but   attributed them to strikes, poor harvests, and "the like which occur   at intervals in the normal course of business." Still he cited   inflation in materials costs as "incredible and universal."
While the general pace of the western economy continues strong, save   real estate, there were two comments that were suggestive of a   slowdown. First, a distributor of heavy equipment reported an   unexpected slowdown in sales and an associated rise in inventories   to a level 32 percent above a year ago. Action is being taken to   reduce these inventories. Second, a large clothing manufacturer   noted that orders for men's clothing are down and that men's   clothing is traditionally the first to feel a slowdown.
There continues to be a slowing in real estate and construction   activity in the West. Only in one area of southern California are   housing sales and residential construction still reported very   strong. One source of continued sales in both San Francisco and Los   Angeles is the conversion of apartment complexes to condominiums. In   most areas, homes are staying on the market much longer than earlier   in the year with particular buyer resistance to homes in the   $100,000 plus range.
Almost all reports suggest a reduced supply of funds available to   the housing market. Three of the largest S&Ls in California have   stopped making new loans and have restricted themselves to   refinancing their own existing loans. A major California bank has   not restricted funds to either builders or home buyers but has   increased rates and tightened terms on mortgage and construction   loans. Eleven percent is now the going prime mortgage rate. Another   large California bank has increased rates to 11 1/4 percent and   reduced maturities from 25 to 15 years. Several small builders in   southern California are reported to have gone out of business due to   this tightening. Construction activity has fallen off considerably   in Idaho, where a 10-percent usury law restricts the flow of funds   to housing.
There appears to be a general consensus in the District that the   money market certificates have helped to prevent savings outflows   from banks and S&Ls. There was some concern expressed that when the   first generation of these certificates mature, savers may move their   money into longer-term Government securities. However, one large   California bank which is monitoring the situation closely, feels   that reinvestment in new certificates will be substantial. Also,   several large S&Ls in California have ceased offering new   certificates, though they are rolling over existing certificates.
