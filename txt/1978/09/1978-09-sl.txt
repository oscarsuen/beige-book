The pace of economic expansion has continued at a moderate rate in   recent weeks according to Eighth District businessmen. Retail sales   continue up and inventories remain at satisfactory levels. Increases   in orders are reported by some manufacturing industries and,   overall, the construction industry continues to register some gain   over a year ago. In the financial area, saving inflows continue   above the expectations of many financial officials, and interest   rates on mortgages have declined slightly in some markets. In the   agricultural sector crop yield prospects are near normal despite   adverse weather conditions in some areas.
Retail sales continue to post modest gains after inflation is taken   into account. Department store sales varied among respondents, but,   on average, sales remain on an upward trend. Some store managers,   whose sales have been stagnant recently, noted less aggressive sales   promotions as one reason for their lackluster performance. Managers   of those stores having gains, noted that the largest sales gains   were among fashionable dresswear for men and women, jewelry, and   higher quality stereo equipment. Inventories are near desired levels   given the sales outlook. Retailers generally believe the sales   outlook is encouraging although some sentiment was expressed that "high" levels of consumer credit might dampen consumers' ability to   maintain spending. Automobile sales are reported to be quite good in   the District. The primary complaint of automobile dealers was the   inability to obtain enough larger-sized cars to meet customers   demands.
The pace of manufacturing activity continues unabated. A major   chemical firm representative reported that larger than expected   sales gains were registered in the past month. A box board company   also reported that increases in sales occurred in recent weeks and   that supply constraints are causing substantial increases in prices.   Manufacturers of building products report a continued high level of   demand, although gains, in general, have not been as rapid this year   as last year. A building products manufacturer expects residential   housing construction to remain near current levels through next   year. Exceptionally strong increases in sales were reported in oil   and gas industry products, with growing backlogs as a result of the   worldwide surge in drilling. One representative reported that   production is being hampered by long delivery schedules for forgings   and certain semi-processed metal products.
Overall the construction industry has continued to advance in the   District. Nonresidential construction has made gains over last year   while housing construction has remained at a high plateau. In the   St. Louis metropolitan region housing starts are holding at   approximately the same level as a year ago. However, more of the new   homes are being built in outlying areas.
Banks and thrift institutions report greater than expected inflows   of savings deposits. These institutions report that the new higher-yielding certificates are partially responsible for the continued   high level of inflows. Some, however, expressed concern about the   effects of the higher yields on profit margins.   However, none of the officials contacted   contemplated a change in policy relative to the new certificates.   Overall loan demand remains generally strong although demand for   some types of loans has apparently lessened in recent weeks. For   example, business loan volume at large commercial banks was   unchanged in August after registering large gains in earlier months.   Nevertheless, the prime lending rate for District banks rose along   with the rate in the larger money markets. The growth in demand for   agricultural loans has subsided in recent months, due, in part, to   improved income in the agricultural sector. Continuing to register   large increases in loan volume during August were real estate and   consumer loans. Quoted rates on home mortgages have remained steady   at 9-3/4 percent for an 80 percent loan and 10 percent on a 90   percent loan; however, lenders in some parts of the District   reported that the actual lending rate had declined slightly.
Farm income prospects continue to be more favorable than a year ago,   largely based on higher crop and livestock prices. Recent prices for   cotton and soybeans provide farmers an opportunity for a profit and   forward contracting is reported to have increased. In some areas,   for example, farmers have already sold as much as one-third of their   soybean crop. Abnormally hot and, in some areas, very dry conditions   in August damaged crop prospects in some southern portions of the   District. Reports indicate, however, that, on the whole, crop yields   will be near normal. Reports indicate that dry pastures in West   Tennessee have led to liquidation of some cattle.
