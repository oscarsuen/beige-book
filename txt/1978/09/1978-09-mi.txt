Developments in the real sector indicate that the Ninth District's   economy may be somewhat stronger than the nation's as the third   quarter draws to a close. However, continued high farm loan demand   plus low seasonal deposit inflows are contributing to tightness in   district money markets.
According to this Bank's August survey of district manufacturers,   sales in the second quarter averaged 15 percent more than a year   ago, with most of the gain coming in durable goods. Durables   producers expect their sales growth to be nearly 20 percent in the   last half of the year, while nondurables manufacturers are looking   towards 10 percent gains. This would mean that district sales of   nondurables will increase about 11 percent for the year, compared to   an expected growth rate of 9 percent nationally (reported in McGraw-Hill's May survey). And durables sales here should increase about 19   percent in 1978, compared to the national expectation of 11 percent.
Construction activity, including mining and energy projects in   Michigan, North Dakota, and Montana, has been very strong this year.   Residential building continues at a record pace despite rising   mortgage rates, and commercial construction is doing very well   according to several sources. Low commercial vacancy rates have   encouraged this activity and should sustain commercial building.
However, shortages of cement are producing some spot reports of job   shutdowns or slowdowns. Major cement plants in the region have had   maintenance problems and have been operating below capacity.   Contractors have been placed on allotments, causing them to look for   additional supplies from other parts of the U.S. and from Canada. A   secondary market for cement is said to have developed.
The generally good picture in construction and manufacturing has   kept the district's unemployment rate well below the national   average. The July rate was 4.6 percent. Tight labor markets were   reported by several Reserve Bank directors, and even the chronically   high unemployment area of upper Michigan is having problems finding   skilled labor.
Excellent crops, improved prices, and government programs have   greatly benefited the district's agricultural sector. Dairy farming   in central Minnesota is said to be as profitable as it has been in   the last five years. Dairy observers expect a robust picture for the   next two years. High prices are holding in the livestock sector,   where profitable operations are once again expected.
The resulting higher farm income is showing up in improved spending   as many farmers upgrade their operations after several years of low   (or negative) profits. Implement dealers are enjoying good sales,   and Minnesota farmers are also investing in irrigation equipment and   crop storage facilities.
Retail sales, especially for durables, are generally good throughout   the district. But several of our sources reported some easing of   soft goods sales. Very warm weather has delayed purchases of fall   clothes, and retailers seem to be in a cautious mood. Although fall   sales are expected to pick up, retailers are keeping inventory   positions at lean, manageable levels.
Financial sector developments are not much different than in the   nation. A generally tight money situation is having the predicted   impact on mortgage funds. About 25 to 50 percent of the "Treasury   bill" CDs are said to represent new deposits.
Seasonal factors are affecting rural banks, however. Deposit growth   at ag banks has been flat during summer months but should improve as   cash flow from harvesting steps up this month.
The upgrading of farm operations has resulted in heavy loan demand   at banks and production credit associations. So rural bankers are   experiencing a tight money situation for factors in addition to   national phenomena. Apparently this tightness has produced many   requests for loan participations, and daily average borrowing from   the Reserve Bank was three times higher than in August 1977.
This situation has left district ag banks with limited but adequate   liquidity. Rural banks are still accepting reasonable loan requests.
However, a major banker in the region expects strong loan demand to   exceed deposit growth at many rural banks next year. Higher   operating costs, equipment upgrading, and rebuilding of livestock   herds are expected to fuel loan demand. As a result, this banker   expects increased use of "outside funds," that is, correspondent   borrowing, Federal Reserve discount window activity, and referral to   the Farm Credit System.
