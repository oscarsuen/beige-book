The level of business activity in the Fifth District was little   changed over the past month, but most areas of activity can still be   characterized as firm. The volume of new orders received by District   manufacturers was essentially unchanged, but shipments continued to   expand and backlogs of orders were up slightly. Retail sales gained   broadly, with relative sales of big ticket items registering a   slight increase over the month. Retailers continue to experience   widespread price increases, while some manufacturers apparently   experienced some relief in this area in recent weeks. Business loan   demand has moderated substantially in recent weeks, but area bankers   expect demand to strengthen in the fourth quarter.
Results of our survey of manufacturers are generally positive,   suggesting continuing expansion at a moderate pace. New orders   changed little over the summer, but remain at the level reached   during a burst of growth last spring and backlogs are large.   Shipments continue to expand at a good pace. Stocks of materials and   finished goods apparently declined slightly in August and although   one-third of our respondents view current levels as excessive,   recent performance of inventories suggests they remain well within   manageable limits. Manufacturers' employment and weekly hours worked   both continued to expand during August. Manufacturers' responses   suggest some improvement in the price situation. Reports of price   increases were less widespread in our latest survey than in recent   months and there were scattered reports of declines in prices   received.
A strike against a principal coal carrying railroad is depressing   coal output and employment in southern West Virginia and southwest   Virginia. The impact of the strike on coal output has been difficult   to assess, but production remains well below the pre-vacation second   quarter level. It has been estimated that from 20,000 to 25,000   miners have been idled as a direct result of the lack of   transportation for mined coal. There is no evidence to date,   however, of coal shortages developing within the District.
Survey responses of retailers suggest continued strength in sales as   well as a recent pickup in relative sales of big ticket items.   Reports from our directors, however, suggest that sales in some   parts of the District are not as strong as they were in early   summer. Retailers responding to our survey report increases in   employment, some further inventory accumulation, and widespread   price advances during the past month.
A majority of manufacturers participating in our survey continues to   hold to the view that business conditions, nationally, will turn   down within six months. A sizable number also expects some decline   in activity in their respective market areas although some are more   optimistic concerning the outlook for their own firms. Retailers   generally expect little change in the level of activity through the   first quarter of 1979, and a majority of our directors share this   view.
Commercial and industrial loans have been flat over the past several   weeks. The heavy loan demand of late spring and early summer,   especially demand for intermediate and long-term loans, has   moderated substantially. This is true of virtually every industrial   classification, including both durable and nondurable goods   manufacturers and the retail trade sector. Bankers are expecting   demand to strengthen in the coming quarter, however. Bankers have   also been looking for signs of a turnaround in the unusually strong   consumer installment loan demand but these signs have not yet   materialized. Automobile sales continue to explain the strong   installment loan demand and there is some feeling that Christmas   sales will help sustain high levels of consumer lending. Second   mortgage loans are a moderately important form of consumer financing   in some areas, but these loans do not appear to be a significant   element in supporting current consumer expenditures.
Residential construction activity is healthy and banks are not   reluctant to finance speculative housing projects. Builders seem to   be doing a good job of gauging their own markets and banks are   apparently not fearful of a sharp reduction in the demand for new   homes. Reports of tighter mortgage markets, however, are increasing.   Thrift institutions in the District of Columbia and Maryland, for   example, have not experienced significant deposit increases   recently.
District farmers' cash receipts from farm marketings have continued   to improve over last year's level, recording a 5 percent gain during   the first half of the year. Further improvement in District farm   income can be expected as the flue-cured tobacco marketing season   progresses. With the season's sales volume through August 31 heavy   and prices averaging 20 percent above a year ago, the value of gross   sales is up some 47 percent over that in the same period last year.   Harvesting of fall crops has begun and is moving at a fairly rapid   pace in southern areas of the District. Crop prospects generally   range from fair to good, while pastures are in fair to excellent   condition.
