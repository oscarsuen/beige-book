Construction employment gains have been even more impressiveâ€”a nine percent increase during the past year. Our Bank's directors report very tight construction labor markets throughout most of the district. In a few areas residential construction activity has weakened, but so far vigorous commercial building has made up for that weakness. Farmers are enjoying good times as well. Eighty percent of the Montana bankers responding to our most recent Ag Credit Survey report their farmer customers are making more money this year than last. Higher livestock prices are cited as the primary reason. Furthermore, grain harvests throughout most of the district have been abundant. And grain prices have held up well, making for record crop values in many parts of the Upper Midwest. Farmers have been storing much of the harvest and reports from around the district indicate grain inventories have nearly exhausted existing storage capacity. Large inventories are unusual in other sectors of the economy. A survey conducted by a large manufacturing concern headquartered in our region, revealed that eighty-five percent of its business customers placed their current inventory levels in the low to normal range. There was some undesired inventory buildup by the Minnesota retailers faced with slackening soft good demand, but these businesses were the exception to the districtwide rule of low to moderate inventory positions. With the exception of cement and credit markets, low inventories are not viewed with concern either. Cement shortages have continued to inconvenience some builders. But, as winter moves in, short supplies of cement are becoming less and less of a problem. In contrast to the cement market, demand has remained strong in the credit market. Bankers throughout the district report that they are having to strain to keep up with loan demand. As elsewhere, nonregulated interest rates are climbing rapidly and the nonprice terms on loans subject to usury limits are becoming more and more restrictive. Furthermore, several of our Bank's directors voiced concern over the detrimental effects of Regulation Q limits and other regulation on the ability of banks and thrifts to compete with credit unions for funds. Directors noted that while many banks had begun offering automatic transfer plans, low customer interest suggested the new service would do little to attract funds from other intermediaries. The main plus seen for the automatic transfer plans was that they might usher in pricing for checking services. Other recent Federal Reserve and Administration policy actions got much more attention than the legalization of automatic transfers. Some observers welcomed the jump in the discount rate and increase in reserve requirements on large CDs as a signal of new resolve in the fight against inflation. Others feared these moves together with the President's wage-price guidelines would harm the real economy.
