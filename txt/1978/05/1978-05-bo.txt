Houthakker and Samuelson insist that the "natural" rate of unemployment should be defined according to objective, technical criteria, and they agree with Tobin and Solow that the natural rate is not as high as 6 percent. Houthakker claims that the natural rate of unemployment is between 4.5 and 5 percent: "The economy is not now at full employment unless it is defined in an unnatural way." He believes that the economy is still recovering and that there is danger in prematurely arresting the process before full capacity is attained. According to Samuelson, there has been no change in the technical evidence in the past year or two to warrant believing that the natural rate of unemployment has been increasing. Samuelson suggests that monetary policy can do little to reduce significantly the current rate of inflation short of causing a recession. Furthermore, he is concerned that "restrictive monetary policy encourages more aggressive fiscal policy which is a recipe for a low rate of capital formation."
