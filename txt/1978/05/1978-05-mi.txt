The Ninth District's economy is showing general improvement midway   through the second quarter, according to most indicators. Retail   sales, which were somewhat disappointing earlier this year, are   picking up. Farm receipts are improving, and livestock producers in   particular are expecting better cash flows this year. As a result,   agricultural bankers are noticing fewer farm debt repayment problems   and are actively seeking new loan accounts. Labor markets have   tightened as district economic activity has advanced, but no serious   labor shortages have emerged. Homebuilding has been strong in most   areas, though increasing costs and mortgage rates have raised some   concerns that housing activity may slow later this year.
With the advent of warmer weather and improving farm income, our   directors unanimously report that retailers are optimistic about the   coming months. One director expects summer tourist spending to be   especially good in his area.
Directors also report that most district retailers are satisfied   with their inventory positions. Only auto dealers appear to be   somewhat overstocked.
Parenthetically, the government set-aside program will probably not   have a significant impact on crop production in the district.   According to directors, the percentage of farmers signing up for   set-asides varies from 25 percent in some areas to 80 percent in   others. However, directors note that farmers can still withdraw from   the program and are likely to do so if market prices continue to   rise.
Directors disagree about whether this pace will continue the rest of   the year.
Several directors are very concerned that increased home prices,   rising mortgage interest rates, and funds shortages will temper   homebuilding activity. For example, several financial institutions   in the Duluth area claim to have stopped accepting mortgage   applications due to reduced deposit inflows. A few directors expect   a slowdown in homebuilding in their areas because the current supply   of new housing is somewhat excessive.
But other directors are confident that homebuilding will continue at   a relatively high pace. One director cites the example of a modular   homebuilder in his area who is experiencing very strong demand. A   metro area banker thinks high lumber costs and rising mortgage rates   will affect homebuilding later this year but not seriously because   many builders have already obtained the necessary financing to get   through 1978.
