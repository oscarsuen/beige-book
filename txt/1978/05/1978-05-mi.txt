The Ninth District's economy is showing general improvement midway   through the second quarter, according to most indicators. Retail   sales, which were somewhat disappointing earlier this year, are   picking up. Farm receipts are improving, and livestock producers in   particular are expecting better cash flows this year. As a result,   agricultural bankers are noticing fewer farm debt repayment problems   and are actively seeking new loan accounts. Labor markets have   tightened as district economic activity has advanced, but no serious   labor shortages have emerged. Homebuilding has been strong in most   areas, though increasing costs and mortgage rates have raised some   concerns that housing activity may slow later this year.
Although retailers probably will not make up all the sales postponed   due to poor weather in the first quarter, directors now report that   sales are good to normal in most areas. Auto sales are said to be   increasing at about the normal seasonal rate after fears that even   this increase would not materialize. The good demand for used cars   provides some evidence of consumer resistance to high new car   prices, however.
With the advent of warmer weather and improving farm income, our   directors unanimously report that retailers are optimistic about the   coming months. One director expects summer tourist spending to be   especially good in his area.
Directors also report that most district retailers are satisfied   with their inventory positions. Only auto dealers appear to be   somewhat overstocked.
District farm cash receipts came in 10 percent above a year ago in   the early months of 1978 because of subsidy payments and improved   commodity prices. Hog, beef, and dairy operations have become   profitable, and farmers who had been holding personal and operating   expenditures to a minimum now seem to be spending more as a result.
Parenthetically, the government set-aside program will probably not   have a significant impact on crop production in the district.   According to directors, the percentage of farmers signing up for   set-asides varies from 25 percent in some areas to 80 percent in   others. However, directors note that farmers can still withdraw from   the program and are likely to do so if market prices continue to   rise.
Rural bankers responding to our April survey report that due to   better farm earnings farm debt repayments have picked up.   Consequently, loan-to-deposit ratios at these banks have not   increased in the last two quarters, and most are making fewer loan   referrals to their correspondents or to nonbank credit agencies. Few   bankers currently expect problems meeting loan demands, and most are   actively seeking good loan accounts.
As the regional economy has improved, labor markets have tightened.   The district's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate has declined   each month this year, averaging 4.4 percent in the first quarter.   Directors report that the demand for skilled workers is particularly   strong relative to supply throughout the district, but most areas   have not yet had serious hiring problems.
Homebuilding has been quite good so far this year. Housing permit   activity seems to have picked up again from the January lull, and   loan commitments at S&Ls are running at a seasonally adjusted annual   rate of 17 percent above the fourth quarter.
Directors disagree about whether this pace will continue the rest of   the year.
Several directors are very concerned that increased home prices,   rising mortgage interest rates, and funds shortages will temper   homebuilding activity. For example, several financial institutions   in the Duluth area claim to have stopped accepting mortgage   applications due to reduced deposit inflows. A few directors expect   a slowdown in homebuilding in their areas because the current supply   of new housing is somewhat excessive.
But other directors are confident that homebuilding will continue at   a relatively high pace. One director cites the example of a modular   homebuilder in his area who is experiencing very strong demand. A   metro area banker thinks high lumber costs and rising mortgage rates   will affect homebuilding later this year but not seriously because   many builders have already obtained the necessary financing to get   through 1978.
