All Districts report that the economy has strengthened further in   recent weeks, but inflation is a dominant concern. Consumer spending   is mixed, with cold weather dampening sales of seasonal merchandise   although car and hard goods sales are generally strong. Further   improvement in manufacturing activity is noted, as orders and   backlogs continue to rise and scattered signs surface of tightening   labor and special product markets. Loan demand at banks continues   strong, except in New York City, and savings and loan associations   have raised mortgage rates as demand exceeds supply. Crop plantings   are behind schedule and may hamper production this year.
District reports uniformly indicate that the economy continues to   expand rapidly. Although there is some uncertainty over prospects   for housing and some doubts about the strength of consumer spending   later this year, there appears to be growing confidence that capital   spending is strengthening (Chicago and Cleveland). Several Districts   report officials are optimistic that the expansion will continue at   least through 1978 but Chicago and Cleveland, looking further ahead,   anticipate it may end in 1979. Philadelphia also reports less   optimism among industrial officials than at any time during this   expansion. The concern that underlies most District reports,   however, is that the rate of inflation is accelerating. Practically   each District notes a worsening in inflation last month, and some   comment that it is their primary concern.
Indicative of the expanding economy is the continued strengthening   in manufacturing activity, as reported by half the Districts.   Further increases in shipments, orders, and backlogs are noted in a   variety of industries, including steel, machine tools, food,   apparel, electrical machinery, nonelectrical machinery, appliances,   chemicals, and home building and construction materials (Boston,   Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, and, St. Louis).   Accompanying this increased activity are reports of shortages of   skilled labor (Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Minneapolis and St. Louis)   and of castings, transportation and storage space for wheat and   grain, small electrical components and cement (Dallas and Kansas   City).
Retail sales present a mixed picture between and within districts.   Half of the districts report strong gains in sales for April, but   several others note mixed spending patterns. Generally, hard goods   and automobiles are selling well, but sales of seasonal merchandise,   including summer apparel and air conditioning units, have been   sluggish or below expectations. Unseasonable weather apparently has   hampered sales. Nevertheless, most retailers are cautiously   optimistic, though they expect sales increases to moderate in coming   quarters. As a result of less than expected increases in retail   sales, inventories are described as at or above desired levels in   several districts (Boston, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York,   Richmond and St. Louis).
Credit demands are generally strong and expectations are for   continued moderate strengthening during the balance of 1978. No   District reports on concerns of a credit squeeze, although some look   for additional firming in interest rates (Atlanta, Boston,   Philadelphia). Business loan demand has been rising rapidly in some   areas (Atlanta, Kansas City, San Francisco and St. Louis) but is   still sluggish in New York City where alternative sources of funds   tend to constrain demand (New York).
Demand for mortgage credit continues strong in all districts and   mortgage rates have firmed in most districts. In response to strong   demand and generally inadequate supplies of mortgage funds, savings   and loans in a number of Districts have curtailed commitments or   loans (Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas and Minneapolis). A few   districts report net outflows in deposits at savings associations,   (Kansas City, San Francisco and St. Louis) while others note only   moderate or small increases in deposits. Uncertainty about prospects   for homebuilding later this year is expressed in a number of reports   that cite further increases in building costs and housing prices,   higher mortgage interest rates, and a shortage of mortgage credit   (Dallas, Minneapolis, San Francisco and St. Louis).
Planting is behind schedule in key agricultural regions of the   country (Chicago, Kansas City, Richmond and St. Louis) because of   wet spring weather and below-normal temperatures, thus raising some   uncertainty over prospects for crop output in 1978. Richmond reports   replanting of seeds will be necessary. While cold, wet weather has   improved production prospects for winter wheat, corn planting has   been delayed and initial estimates of production of corn and   soybeans for 1978 are highly uncertain (Kansas City). Dallas reports   drought is hampering plantings and livestock production.
