The Tenth District economy seems to be in good shape after a   weather-depressed first quarter. Spring has been cold and rainy, but   retail sales have shown a strong seasonal increase. Department store   executives believe their inventory levels to be excessive, although   they expect rising sales will take care of the problem. Purchasing   agents drawn from a cross section of businesses report lengthening   lead times for some items, and continually rising prices for almost   all inputs. Inventories of materials are generally considered to be   at satisfactory levels. The wet spring has been good for the winter   wheat crop, but it has delayed corn planting. Looking ahead toward   the grain harvest season, transportation and storage problems can be   anticipated. In banking, loan demand continues strong, although farm   loans have declined, and total deposits are growing well despite   flat-to-declining levels in time and savings deposits.
Retail sales this spring at District department stores are up   healthily over last year, and store executives are optimistic that   consumer demand will continue to rise at least modestly in coming   months. Inventories at retail, however, are reported to be "too   high", largely because of sales that did not materialize during the   unseasonably cold winter weather. Price increases at wholesale, the   retailers report, are routinely passed on to the consumer by   maintaining a customary percentage markup over cost.
The prices of raw materials and intermediate goods are generally 6   to 10 per cent above those of last year, according to purchasing   agents in the District. While the prices of certain inputs are up   even more (e.g., lumber and pulpboard), the prices of a few others   are actually lower than those of a year ago (e.g., denim fabric).   Lead times on orders of capital goods are lengthening, say   purchasing agents, naming castings as an item in especially short   supply. Most buyers say their inventories of materials are at   satisfactory levels, although a majority of those who are not   satisfied are trying to reduce stocks.
Although the cold, wet spring across the Great Plains and Middle   West has improved production prospects for wheat, it has created   some problems for corn and soybean producers. After a late start,   corn planting is now under way. However, additional delays much past   the middle of May could well result in lower total U.S. corn acreage   than presently anticipated. At this time, it is uncertain whether   producers would then switch acres from corn to soybeans or increase   their participation in the Government's feed grain diversion   program. Thus, initial corn and soybean production estimates for   1978 incorporate a high degree of uncertainty.
Although initial projections for 1978 U.S. wheat and feed grain   production are down from 1977 levels, storage space for the new crop   will likely be tighter than at any time in recent years.   Transportation delays and the loss of storage capacity (principally   at export elevators) because of elevator explosions have compounded   the space problems in many rural areas. These transportation   problems are unlikely to be resolved before the 1978 wheat harvest   begins. Consequently, farmers may experience some short-term cash   flow disruptions as a result of their inability to market 1977 and   1978 crop production as quickly as they might like.
Tenth District bankers report that loan demand continues to grow at   a rapid pace. Business loan demand is particularly brisk, with large   increases in both loans to businesses supplying firms active in the   oil fields and in term loans for petroleum and mineral production.   Construction lending has increased sharply, and loans to mortgage   bankers are up. Borrowing by agribusiness firms, especially grain   elevator companies, is strong. However, farm loans have declined,   due in part to funds being available from Government support   programs. This decline in farm loans has increased the liquidity of   country banks, and the loan demand of country banks has,   consequently, been slack. Demand for real estate loans is strong.   Consumer loan demand is moderate.
All of the bankers surveyed report strong deposit growth. Demand   deposits are up sharply, but time and savings deposits have leveled   off or are declining. Further increases in interest rates are   expected to result in additional savings outflows, especially at   thrift institutions. Bankers expect to have sufficient funds to meet   loan demand over the next few months.
