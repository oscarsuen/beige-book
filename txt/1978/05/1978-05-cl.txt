Officials and economists in the Fourth District have expected a   surge in income, production and sales this quarter, but recent high   rates of inflation have raised uncertainty over continued expansion   for another year. Auto producers and suppliers anticipate some letup   in sales from recent high rates, and retailers see little prospect   for improvement in sales of nondurable goods. Steel production is   expected to rise to about 90 percent of capacity this quarter; coal   production has rebounded virtually to capacity. Mortgage loan demand   continues strong, and mortgage rates have firmed in response to weak   growth in deposits.
A vigorous recovery in output is widely expected this quarter, with   some economists forecasting real GNP gains as high as a 9 percent   annual rate. Even at this higher rate, however, real GNP for the   first half would fall short of expectations held earlier this year.   One frequently cited reason for this anticipated shortfall is a   higher than expected rate of inflation. Some economists believe the   sharpness of the recovery is conducive to price increases in those   industries that have not been able to raise prices because of   relatively weak markets. Also mentioned as an additional factor in   inflation is the increasing use of marginal labor that has added to   costs.
The recent sharp pickup in consumer spending has not been uniform.   While auto sales surged, consumer spending for nondurable goods has   been relatively flat. The March-April surge in new car sales is   explained as a make-up from the poor economy and severe winter   weather. Although pleased by the comeback in sales, economists with   major auto suppliers expect some letup from the recent 12 million   annual rate to about 10.8 million units for the year. An economist   with a major producer expects that sales this quarter will range   between 11.4 to 11.7 million units (2.0 million imports) and average   at least 11.1 million sales for the year.
Strength in auto sales has not been matched by increased sales for   some other types of consumer goods. An economist with a national   retail chain states that despite recent impressive gains, sales   increases only equaled their earlier expectations for an 8 percent   year-over-year gain for the February-April period. There was little   recouping of earlier sales losses. Apparel and soft goods sales have   been sluggish for the past several months and inventories are more   than ample. In his view, retailers face a sharp reduction in profits   for the next few quarters with general merchandise sales increases   of about 3.5 percent in real terms from the fourth quarter of 1977   to fourth quarter of 1978. Similarly, retail sales of personal care   products and packaged foods have shown little if any gain in real  terms compared with a year earlier.
Steel industry economists expect production to increase to about 90   percent of effective capacity this quarter from last quarter's 80   percent rate. Order cutbacks are not evident yet, but one economist   expects a usual seasonal slump in orders and production next quarter   as steel consumers realize that inventories are ample and supplies   are readily available. Imports last quarter were at a record high   level for that quarter, and it is unlikely that the full impact of   trigger pricing of steel will be felt until the third quarter,   according to one steel economist. Profits are expected to improve   sharply this quarter following another weak performance last   quarter. Still, higher profits will not result in increased capital   spending.
Coal production is rebounding rapidly from the strike. Output   recently has been boosted to more than 15 million tons weekly,   compared with a low of 5 million tons during the strike. An   economist with a major coal producer expects production will soon   reach pre-strike levels of 16 million tons weekly and may rise to 17   million tons by yearend. Coal stocks at the end of April were at a   67-day supply but should be much higher to meet seasonal demand in   July and August. Consequently, a shortfall in stocks would concern   utilities which may be forced to purchase coal at higher prices in   the spot market.
Capital goods producers are growing more confident over prospects   for 1978 and early 1979 than they were at any time in this   expansion. Expectation of at least a 7.5 percent real gain seems   common. Orders for electrical equipment, communication and printing   equipment have been rising more rapidly than shipments for the past   several months, although the rate of increase in new orders has not   accelerated. Machine tool orders revived strongly and set new highs   last quarter, according to machine tool builders.
Mortgage terms continue to firm in response to softness in deposit   flows and strong level of demand. S&Ls raised rates at the beginning   of May by 1/4 percent to 91/2 percent for an 80 percent loan, and   some are charging 101/4 percent for a 95 percent loan. Some   associations no longer are making 95 percent loans and also are   cutting back lending in national markets. While a number of   officials state it is too early to determine whether double-digit   mortgage rates will curtail demand, some feel prospective homeowners   are willing to pay high rates because of inflationary expectations.   Deposit flows continue to fall short of projections, but some S&Ls   have been aggressively attracting deposits by raising interest rates   to maximum levels on all types of deposit accounts. A major S&L  reported that deposit flows in April exceeded their projection and   so far in May deposits have equaled projections. S&Ls have hesitated   to issue mortgage-backed securities because of the high costs   relative to lending rates in this region.
