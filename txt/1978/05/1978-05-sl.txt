Business activity in the Eighth District has continued to register   gains in recent weeks. While consumer spending on many summer-related items has been retarded by unfavorable weather, automobile   sales have shown considerable strength. Inventories of some items   are reported to be higher than desired, but this situation is not   viewed with alarm, and retailers generally remain optimistic about   future sales gains. Manufacturing activity continues to advance in   several key industries, including suppliers of homebuilding   products, transportation equipment, and chemicals. Demand for   single-family homes continues to be strong, but concerns were   expressed by homebuilders about their prospects next year. Some   savings and loan associations, as well as commercial banks,  registered either declines or no change in time and savings deposits   in April. With strong demand for mortgage credit, mortgage interest   rates have continued to increase. In the farming sector, crop   planting is behind schedule, although the situation is not critical   at this time.
The movements in retail sales were mixed in April as department   store sales were reported to be somewhat sluggish, but automobile   sales registered further gains. The sluggish performance of   department store sales was largely blamed by retailers on the   colder-than-normal spring weather which hampered sales of such items   as summer clothing and air-conditioning equipment. Inventories were   reported to be somewhat excessive for these items, but the sales   slump is not expected to be permanent and the inventory buildup is   not considered to be a serious problem at this time. Retail   passenger car and truck sales in April registered gains relative to   a year ago and dealer inventories are at desired levels for most   models.
Manufacturing activity continues to expand. Firms supplying the   homebuilding industry are among those experiencing continued strong   demand. A representative of a major appliance manufacturing firm   reported sizable increases in orders, particularly from the contract   business, but felt that the current growth rate was not sustainable   over the longer term. Firms manufacturing such building products as   connector plates, electrical fixtures, tools, other hardware,   paints, and coatings reported strong demand. In general, however,   the gains in 1978 are expected to be less than in 1977. The   transportation equipment industry is another sector showing strong   performance in the District. A representative of the automobile   industry reported automobile orders are running above a year ago and   assembly lines are operating at a high level. Aircraft, railroad   car, and barge manufacturing firms are also experiencing high levels   of demand for their products. The chemical industry, a major   industry in the District, has also made some gains recently. A   representative of a major chemical firm reported strong demand for   agricultural and industrial chemicals and some pickup in demand for   fibers after a poor first quarter.
The District housing industry continues to "boom" with the gains   concentrated in the single-family market. The large order backlog of   new homes in the St. Louis area has not yet dissipated, reflecting   continued strong home sales. As construction activity has gained   some momentum this spring, shortages of skilled workers and   bricklayers are beginning to show up. However, such shortages are   not viewed by homebuilders as an insurmountable problem and   apprentice programs are bulging. Homebuilders are beginning to   express some fear about a sharp decline in home demand in the   future. Their special concerns are the possibility of   disintermediation, rising mortgage rates, and the continuation of   sharply rising costs of building supplies. Builders report that the   cost of building materials rose about 15 percent last year.
Representatives of some savings and loan associations reported a net   outflow of deposits in April. This was said to reflect improved   yields on short- and medium-term securities as well as renewed   interest in the stock market. Representatives of the savings and   loan industry report increased advertising budgets and more   offerings of premiums in an attempt to maintain or advance their   market share of savings. With strong demand for mortgages,   considerable upward pressure has been placed on mortgage interest   rates. Rates have advanced about 1/4 of one percentage point in the   St. Louis and Memphis areas since last month. Considerable concern   was also expressed by savings and loan representatives about the   recent action of the Federal Reserve which allows automatic   transfers between savings and demand accounts at commercial banks.   These officials fear that interest-sensitive funds would be   withdrawn from their institutions and thus reduce the supply of   credit to the housing industry.
Similar to the savings and loan associations, small consumer time   and savings deposits at large commercial banks registered little or   no increase in April from a month earlier, although sizable   increases in the volume of large CDs occurred. Loan demand at   commercial banks showed considerable strength in April in both   commercial and industrial loans and consumer installment loans.
