Business activity has been quite strong since last report. The pace   of retail sales has remained healthy, though perhaps a shade less   robust than in March. A continuation of exceptional business loan   growth has encouraged a rise in local prime rates. S&Ls in a few   cities have cut back on new mortgage commitments. Capital spending   decisions have broadened the nonresidential construction base.   Transportation costs have been pegged as sources of price pressures.   The employment outlook is good, and port business is excellent.
Consumer spending continued to show strong year-to-year gains in   April, although there are indications that buying activity moderated   from the hectic March pace. A slight loss of sales momentum noted by   Florida department stores in late April probably reflects the   beginning of a seasonal lull after record levels of tourist inflows.   Jewelry and hard goods sales have been described as brisk. Auto   sales edged down during the month, but dealers are generally quite   pleased with the improvement from the April 1977 pace.
Business loans continue to surge at District banks, with trade and   manufacturing firms borrowing especially heavily in the latest   weeks. Several of the larger banks raised their prime rates to 8 1/4   percent within the past week. Inflows of household time deposits   have been moderate.
With lower levels of savings inflows and higher borrowing costs,   S&Ls in Jacksonville, Nashville, and Knoxville have shown signs of   backing off from new mortgage commitments. In Jacksonville, the   cutbacks are being accomplished via selection rather than rate   increases, but some associations in the Tennessee cities have raised   rates another quarter point to 9 3/4 percent (for 80-percent   mortgages). The higher rates have increased the points that must be   given up in selling VA and FHA loans. One director says that   Nashville lenders have virtually stopped making such loans, while in   Knoxville, homeowners are reluctant to sell to applicants for   guaranteed loans. Builders in that city are either not building to   FHA specifications or are raising prices to cover the point gap.
Recent plant announcements add variety to the industries and   locations included in the Southeast's capital spending gains. Within   the past year, announcements of large goods-producing facilities   have been largely confined to the electronics and phosphate   industries in central Florida, chemical or paper operations, mainly   in Louisiana, and tire plants in Alabama. Georgia took the honors   last month, as CBS, Oscar-Mayer, and Miller all committed to   substantial investments in that state. Trade and distributive   industries will provide more of a push to commercial investment   (which has been dominated for the last year or so by tourism-related   ventures), with a large chunk of speculative office space in the   planning stage in Tampa and public and private improvements to ports   and airports under way in several cities.
In Florida, rising prices of tires and equipment are squeezing   profits in truck leasing and transport, but demand is strong. One   director remarked that a truck shortage has driven up the cost of   transporting perishables out of state. Truck hauling rates were   listed among the major contributors to inflation of construction   materials prices by another director; other items were cement,   stone, spare parts, rail freight rates, fuel, electricity,   insurance, and wages. TVA estimates that coal workers' wage   increases will add 6 percent to the cost of its services over the   next three years.
Wages won't put much pressure on overall construction costs in North   Florida, where contractors have negotiated a 3 1/2-percent increase   for each of the next two years with five of seven major construction   workers' unions. Ample supplies of nonunion labor allowed the low   settlement. Heavy in-migration of semiskilled nonfarm workers is   reported to be holding up Florida's jobless rate. There, and   throughout the District, skilled labor seems in short supply.   Surveys of hiring plans and the labor requirements of new   investments indicate that the outlook for District job growth is   very good.
The District's ports have been extremely busy. Auto imports generate   much of the activity at Jacksonville and are expected to advance 25   percent during 1978. Recent agreements suggest that substantial   exports of oranges to Japan will continue; a new ship, built   expressly to carry the fruit to Japan and return with Toyotas, is   now operating out of Jacksonville. Other developments at the   Jacksonville Port include a decline in steel imports, stable coffee   imports, and "good" wood pulp exports but virtually no paper   exports. The booming phosphate industry accounts for a sizable share   of export growth at the Tampa Port and, to a lesser extent, at   Jacksonville.
