The business expansion in the Seventh District continues on a broad   front, and with a minimum of disruptive influences. Concern is   growing that price inflation is proceeding at a faster pace.   Consumer spending is strong overall, but cold, damp weather has held   back sales of seasonal merchandise. Capital expenditure prospects   have strengthened, with a growing boost from nonresidential   construction. Demand for mortgage credit is "intense." The financial   position of the farm sector has improved.
Business and financial executives are worried over inflation   (apparently accelerating), increasingly onerous government   regulations, the federal deficit, the trade deficit, and other   national and international problems. Somewhat surprisingly,   virtually all executives expect improvement in the sales and profits   of their own enterprises. Many expect the expansion to level off or   turn down in 1979, but the signs are not yet evident, except perhaps   in the residential mortgage sector.
New hiring continues at a good pace in most centers. Complaints are   increasing, however, over the quality of job applicants, especially   for jobs requiring acquired skills.
A number of large general merchandise chains in the District report   that sales of seasonal merchandise have fallen short of expectations   in the past several weeks. This is attributed partly to bad weather   and partly to the aggressive pricing and promotions of a very large   national chain. Big ticket items are generally selling well,   including appliances, furniture, autos, and light trucks. Demand for   installment credit is very strong, and availability appears ample.   Telephone utilities report a large rise in new installations and   toll calls. Airline traffic continues to exceed forecasts made early   in the year, for full fare as well as discount traffic.
Orders for capital goods have improved fairly steadily since the   start of the year, and backlogs have been building—to record highs   for some firms. Among the strongest sectors are heavy trucks,   freight cars, machine tools and equipment for construction,   materials handling, lumbering, and communications. Among the weaker   sectors are farm equipment, large mining shovels, draglines, and   environmental systems—the latter affected by a lag in availability   of federal grants.
Nonresidential construction activity is picking up, mainly for   commercial but also for industrial buildings. Leasing of vacant   commercial structures has been picking up rapidly "throughout the   country." Ten large office buildings in Chicago's Loop are now   underway or will be started this year. Activity is also very strong   in some far-out suburban areas. Other large district centers do not   match Chicago's performance.
Inflows of savings to S&Ls improved in March, but were down 60   percent from a year ago in April. The standard mortgage rate in the   Chicago area is now 9.75 percent, plus 2 to 3 points, with some S&Ls   at 10 percent. The mortgage terms picture has changed rapidly in the   past several weeks. Some S&Ls have adopted a "customers only"   policy. With the help of FHLB loans and sales in the secondary   markets, mortgage volume on both new and used homes may be as large   as last year. This would mean fewer units, however. The market for   single-family homes is called "phenomenal," and availability of   rental units is low, partly because of condominium conversions.
Farmers made considerable headway in spring field work last week,   but overall progress-to-date is about three weeks behind normal.   Heavy rains this weekend point to further delays.
District farmland values rose nearly 4 percent in the first quarter.   Very few agricultural banks note an increase in land purchases by   foreign investors.
Incomes of district farmers have been boosted by the 7-month rise in   prices of feed grains and livestock. Farm loan repayments improved   further in the first quarter, although the rate is still somewhat   slow. Loan-to-deposit ratios at rural banks rose to a new high. An   unusually high proportion (44 percent) of the banks are operating   with higher-than-desired ratios.
Steel demand is the strongest since the expansion began. One   producer expects to operate at capacity through June. A larger share   of steel shipments is for capital equipment and nonresidential   construction. Steel warehouses appear to be turning away from   imports, apparently expecting higher prices and/or problems of   availability.
