Even the Sixth District felt some ill effects of recent severe   weather. Low temperatures added to the strain on already   questionable supplies of coal. Construction activity was interrupted   and retail sales were slowed in some areas, but strength in   unaffected areas and earlier last month gave the District a   satisfactory January record in both respects. Damage to winter crops   was minimal. Thrift institutions have taken steps to compensate for   smaller deposit inflows and generally feel capable of meeting   continued heavy demand for home loans. But recent mortgage rate   increases have been met with a flurry rather than a flight of home   buyers. Foreign capital has become increasingly significant in the   District's commercial and industrial development and more frequently   discussed.
Savings and loan associations, faced with mild to moderate   reductions in savings inflows and the smallest paydowns in many   years, generally believe they will be able to meet expected strong   demand for home mortgages. Campaigns to promote savings are under   way; more associations are offering ceiling rates on certificates,   advertising, and giving premiums. The Atlanta Home Loan Bank   president feels that the good earnings and liquidity positions of   southeastern associations will allow them to pay higher rates and   still meet housing demands; however, mortgage rate hikes have been   common in the past six weeks. The going conventional rates are 9   percent f or 80 percent loans and 9 1/4 to 9 1/2 percent with 10   percent down payments, up from 8 1/2-8 3/4 percent a month earlier;   closing costs have moved up about half a point as well. The   currently prevailing rates in Florida are slightly lower, but some   cities report top-of-range rates and a number of associations have   announced increases to take effect on March 1.
Announcements of coming increases in mortgage interest rates have   brought home buyers out of the woodwork, according to a director   from South Florida. Yet in Atlanta, where higher rates are already   in effect, buyers are coming out in force to head off possible   further hikes. Indeed, the only sign of slackening of surging   housing demand has been a leveling of single-family home   construction in a few areas of Florida where lots have grown scarce   and some recent building has been speculative. There, and in other   parts of that state, condominium starts and sales have been quite   brisk, stimulated by negligible apartment vacancy rates and high   rents. Poor weather nationwide has induced a spurt in preretirement   home buying and in requests for rental housing in southeast Florida.
With no end to the United Mine Workers' strike in sight, coal   supplies have become strained in some areas. Mining operations have   virtually halted in Alabama, where 12,000 miners are off the job,   although only 70 percent are union members. Severe weather has   hindered nonunion production in northeast Tennessee, putting further   pressure on prices that are already $l0-$l5 per ton above usual.   Electric utilities and major industrial users, most of whom are   relatively comfortable with 30-60 day supplies, fear that delivery   start-up will not be timely unless settlement and ratification come   quickly. Although the TVA has systemwide supplies of about two   months, reserves at five of its twelve coal-burning plants are down   to three weeks or less; power supplies have been curtailed in at  least one rural area of Tennessee. Deliveries to TVA are running   about 20 percent of normal; a spokesman says that shifting of coal   between plants is not practical. U. S. Steel in Birmingham has   undertaken conservation efforts; a coal "loan" from the Redstone   Arsenal was required to keep Huntsville area schools open. On the   other hand, Mississippi Power carries a 150-day supply, and one TVA   plant is flush with reserves adequate for 250 operating days. A   director in the coal industry expects that negotiated wage increases   and higher severance taxes and related costs will add at least 25   percent to the price of coal.
Icy roads and extreme cold put a damper on consumer spending in the   northern portions of the District; consequently, month-end retail   stocks weren't as light as expected. However, a fairly strong sales   pace continued in areas that were least affected by the cold, and   heavy early January buying kept monthly sales estimates even with   January 1976 or better in the worst afflicted locations. Auto sales   were generally slow but picking up in late January.
Damage to citrus crops from two freezes was mainly limited to   specialty fruits and should have little or no impact on the   availability of orange concentrate. Fresh orange shipments are   running about one million boxes behind last year this season. The   late start and projected high returns for processed fruit have been   restraints, but the primary reason has been sky-high prices: FOB   prices have risen 60 percent over the year, and on-tree prices have   quadrupled. Cotton prices continued the uptrend which began in early   December, despite the release of reports of heavier-than-expected   1977 production and planting intentions for 1978 and of declines in   mill consumption and advance sales for export. A director attributes   the price strength to the depressed exchange value of the dollar. He   also expects near-record marketings (and thus some price weakness)   of fed cattle in the next three months. In Louisiana, the trickle of   sugar mill closings continues and threatens to grow; producers say   they want out of raw sugar. Processing operations, however, are   expanding. As regards the farm strike, some 200 Georgia farmers have   promised to withhold 50 percent of their land from production this   year; they claim that their counterparts have promised to set aside   at least 25 million acres nationwide.
Foreign investment, actual and suspected, has become a hot topic of   discussion among southeastern businessmen. A regional real estate   firm headquartered in Atlanta described foreign investment in   income-producing properties as heavy and primarily from European   interests. A director notes that foreign investors bought two-thirds   of the shopping centers, one-third of the office buildings, and one-  fifth of the large apartment buildings sold in Florida's Dade and   Broward Counties last year. There are 55 foreign-owned projects   currently under construction or planned in that state, compared to 4   at this time last year. The list includes Siemens-Allis Chalmers'   huge electric generator plant recently announced for the Bradenton   area. Miami banks have been hard pressed to put to work their recent  strong inflows of South American capital. However, business analysts   in Georgia indicate that foreign investment in farmland has been   insubstantial, despite rumors to the contrary.
Inventory accumulation appears to be accelerating modestly after   slowing through year-end. A Georgia survey of purchasing agents   indicates that stocks, both current and expected in the near term,   are rising, particularly of finished goods. Deliveries are slowing,   lead times lengthening. Goods in short supply in the District   include a number of building materials, paper for web offset   presses, and oil-drilling rigs.
