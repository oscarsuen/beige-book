of disintermediation." With mortgage demand remaining strong, the rate on conventional mortgages has been raised over 50 basis points since November to 9 1/2 percent at many S&Ls. That is only 1/2 percentage point below the state's usury rate. S&Ls are increasingly more selective in the type of properties they will finance. Many S&Ls that had previously stayed out of the secondary market report that they will now enter it to secure funds, and those that were already in it report that market is tightening. The rise in land values in the District is easing adjustment problems for banks on some real estate loans. Renewal of speculative interest in "raw" land is also reported. Agribankers, responding to our latest quarterly survey, indicate that rural land values could remain fairly stable in the months ahead following the modest 5- to 6-percent increases recorded in 1977. Much of the appreciation of land values is due to inquiries and purchases from nonagricultural investors. Activity in the Red River areas of Texas and Louisiana is particularly strong. However, in many areas of Texas, reduced cash flows and incomes from lower crop prices and higher production costs have slowed the expansion of farm operations, causing land prices to advance more slowly. In fact, the rise of costs associated with fueling irrigation pumps has forced the average value of irrigated cropland on the Texas High Plains to decline in each of the past four quarters.
