Fifth District business activity generally picked up in January   judging from our latest survey. Such measures of activity as new   orders, backlogs of orders, and employment improved among   manufacturers surveyed. Only shipments, apparently held down by   adverse weather conditions, showed no gain. Retailers also noted   improved conditions as reflected by rising total sales and relative   sales of big ticket items. Nonetheless, manufacturing respondents   are less optimistic than they were a month ago. At least part of   this change in attitudes is possibly due to apparently imminent   curtailments of power consumption dictated by dwindling coal stocks.   Despite the recent implementation of emergency measures in some   areas, however, actual effects of the coal situation so far have   been minimal. In the financial sector, mortgage demand continues to   be strong on a seasonally adjusted basis. To date, supplies of   mortgage funds have been adequate. In some areas terms of lending   are tightening in response to slower deposit growth.
Conditions among Fifth District manufacturers firmed over the past   month with one-third of our respondents reporting an increased   volume of new orders and rising order backlogs. Despite the fact   that inventories, of both finished goods and materials, expanded   over the month, there was no increase in the number of respondents   reporting excessive inventories. Employment among manufacturing   respondents also rose slightly but hours worked per week remained   stable. Prices, meanwhile, continued to increase generally, although   several manufacturers report declines in prices received.
Among retailers responding to our survey, both total sales and the   relative sales of big ticket items improved over the past month.   Retail inventories apparently declined slightly and are now   essentially in line with desired levels. One respondent, however,   views current stocks as lower than desired. Prices and wages were   generally higher than a month ago according to the retailers   surveyed. Most Fifth District directors now anticipate that 1978   automobile sales in their areas will be somewhat weaker than in   1977.
Although the expectations of our respondents regarding future   business activity remain basically optimistic, manufacturers'   expectations seem to have weakened somewhat over the past month.   Fewer than one-third expect the general level of business activity,   nationally, locally, and in their respective firms to improve over   the next six months. On the other hand, more than one in six now   foresees some deterioration of conditions over that time period.
Other than the direct employment impact upon workers in a few   industries, e.g., miners and railroad workers, and some secondary   impact in such areas as local retail sales and state government   revenues in coal mining areas, the coal strike has had little effect   on the District economy to date. Dwindling coal stocks, however,   have led to some minor power curtailments by electric utilities   serving West Virginia and parts of Maryland and Virginia. If these   utilities are forced to rely on their current coal stocks and are   unable to tap outside sources of electrical power, major   curtailments are possible within the next ten days to two weeks. The   utility regulatory body in West Virginia has already initiated an   emergency plan which will institute gradual service curtailments as   needed.
Comments of our directors and industry sources suggest some   tightening in mortgage markets, at least in some areas of the   District. A slowing of deposit inflows at lending institutions   coupled with a seasonally vigorous demand for mortgage loans has   created a general impression that a continued tightening of market   conditions will be increasingly reflected in lending terms over the   next several months. To date, however, adjustments have been   scattered and apparently concentrated principally in the larger   cities.
The volume of credit extended by large Fifth District banks has been   unchanged since the beginning of the year. Consumer loans, other   than mortgages, have increased only modestly while business loans   have been essentially flat. At the same time inflows of deposits   appear to have been slow. There has been no gain in savings   deposits, and the growth of large negotiable CD's has leveled off.
Replies to our fourth quarter farm credit survey revealed that last   year's drought-reduced crop output and the tightening cost-price   squeeze combined to create cash-flow problems for many Fifth   District farmers. Bankers as a result have experienced much slower   loan repayment rates and a sharp increase in requests for renewals   and extensions. Farmers' demand for credit from traditional lenders   continues fairly strong even though many farmers have been able to   qualify for Federal drought disaster loans. Bank supplies of   loanable funds seem to be adequate for the demand, but they are   apparently at the lowest level since this survey began more than two   years ago.
District farmers may cut 1978 cotton acreage 26 percent from last   year but are likely to offset this reduction partially by increasing   soybean plantings 9 percent. Planned feed grain acreage is down 5   percent as was the acreage seeded to food grains (wheat and rye)   last fall. These intended plantings are as of January 1 and may   change considerably by planting time.
