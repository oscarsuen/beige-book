Blizzards and the effects of the coal shortage have distorted   District economic activity for the past several weeks. Retail sales   have weakened partly in response to prolonged sub-freezing   temperatures throughout most of the District. The coal shortage has   hampered manufacturing in some areas, and while layoffs have been   minimal, mandatory curtailments in electrical power will cause   considerable layoffs when imposed. Savings flows into savings and   loans continued to soften in February and while commitments are not   being cut back, officials are cautious over prospects for both   commitments and mortgage loans for 1978.
Retailers of general merchandise and automobiles attribute some of   the weakness in retail sales to severe winter weather. While recent   poor performance of sales has not discouraged retailers, some appear   less confident than they were a month or two ago. One official of a   large department store chain, who remains optimistic for the short   run, expects a 15 percent gain in first quarter sales over last   year. Sales increases are expected to taper off as the year   progresses. An economist with a national retail chain expected some   let-up in sales this quarter following an unsustained rate of   increase in the fourth quarter of 1977. Despite the large drop in   sales during January, he still expects a 9 to 9 1/2 percent increase   for the year. A banker noted that retail sales had been depressed   directly and indirectly by the coal strike.
Auto producers and auto suppliers differ on expectations for auto   sales and output this year. An economist with a major auto producer   expects new car sales of 10.9 million units in 1978, only slightly   below his original forecast of 11.2 million last fall. He believes   that bad weather over a larger part of the country this year than   last has been an important factor in holding down car sales. Auto   suppliers, including producers of flat glass, tires and auto   components, expect sales in a range of 10.5 to 10.7 million units   this year. While suppliers generally note some easing and setbacks   in orders from auto producers, none consider this of consequence.
The coal shortage has resulted in only scattered production cutbacks   and layoffs, but worsening conditions can be expected if mandatory   controls on electricity are imposed this week in some large   metropolitan centers of the District. Of 9 major utilities in the   District, all but 3 have plans calling for mandatory cutbacks in   power usage that range from 25 to 50 percent when coal stocks fall   to a 40-day supply. Three utilities that serve Toledo, Cleveland and   Dayton have coal stocks that range from 52 to 60 days. Three   utilities that have a mandatory cutback when stocks fall to a 40-day   supply have a 43 to 50 day supply. Three utilities have coal stocks   that range from 25 to 33 days' supply and plan mandatory cutbacks of   50 percent perhaps early this week. One of these utilities serves   the Pittsburgh area and another serves northern Ohio.
The situation is of course fluid because of daily changes in supply   conditions. A principal problem is that several utilities cannot   physically increase purchased-power, and supplies of non-union mined   coal has either dwindled sharply or has virtually ended. Although   coal production this month is estimated at about 25 million tons,   compared with a typical monthly average of 60-65 million tons,   utilities claim these supplies are not available.
Several manufacturers have indicated that they can manage their   operations with a 25 percent cutback in electrical power possibly by   diverting production to other plants, reducing overtime, reducing   the number of shifts, and perhaps, using small generator facilities.   Larger cutbacks would result in sizable decreases in both production   and employment.
Supplies of other fuels range from adequate to excessive. A large   natural gas supplier in northeast Ohio expects supplies are adequate   to accommodate continued below normal temperatures into mid-March,   unless temperatures fall much below zero. Another supplier has   requested voluntary conservation by its largest customers in order   to assure adequate supplies for the coming month. Despite recent   cutbacks in refining, inventories of crude, distillate fuels and   gasoline are still well above normal levels.
Steel operations this quarter appear to be much improved from last   quarter. Capacity utilization will probably rise to the mid-80's   compared with about 75 percent last quarter. The improvement in part   represents price hedge buying, stronger than expected orders for   March represent some hedging against the possibility that steel   operations will be curtailed by severe cutbacks. Recent steel price   increases have been holding, which again is viewed as customer   concern over steel supplies. The record volume of steel imports in   December is the result of efforts to ship as much steel as possible   before the effective date of reference pricing of steel on February   21. One steel economist estimates that the selling price of EEC   steel shipped into the U.S. should be about $60 per ton higher than   the U.S. price, rather than $80-$90 below U.S. prices.
Executives with thrift institutions are cautious about the outlook   for mortgage credit. They have not cut commitments on new mortgage   loans and do not expect to curtail commitments unless net savings   flows deteriorate further. Officials generally feel there is room   for further reduction in liquidity. The main source of concern is   volatility of deposit flows, especially in passbook accounts. Most   associations had a small gain in net deposits during January,   although some larger associations had negative flows. Inflows so far   in February are generally positive although outflows were   experienced around February 16 when the two-year 7.7 percent   Treasury note was offered. Despite positive inflows, several   officials noted cash flow this year has been falling behind   expectations and in some cases below the volume of commitments.
Mortgage loan demand in the District is described as strong or   stronger than last year and one official explained the recent 1/4   percent rise in mortgage lending rates in Cleveland (generally 9   percent for an 80 percent loan) as an effort to restrain demand.   Some associations expect to maintain lending by tapping the   secondary mortgage market, and some others plan to either step-up or   undertake sale of mortgage backed securities as an additional source   of capital.
