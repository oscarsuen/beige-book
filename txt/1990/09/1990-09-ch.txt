Auto sales nationally were little changed in August from recent months, with sources indicating that the Middle East situation has not yet influenced sales. One Midwest dealers' association executive noted that orders for larger cars have not yet been cancelled. A District import car distributor experienced record July sales and reported that August sales were on track to be the best single month in the history of the distributorship. However, a domestic automaker estimated car sales in the remainder of 1990 could drop roughly 500,000 units (saar) below previous estimates, if oil prices stabilize in the neighborhood of $25 per barrel.
Purchasing manager surveys in the District showed mixed results for August, continuing an uneven pattern. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the Chicago index showed conditions improving slightly in August, led by production, new orders, and prices. The Milwaukee report was mixed, but indicated new strength in the new orders component. The Detroit index in August showed its sharpest drop since November 1987, with both the automotive and non-automotive sector indexes showing contraction. On balance, however, recent District activity has been relatively stronger than that reported in the national survey.
Area housing sales grew in July, compared to a national decline. The Midwestern market remains one of the "healthiest in the nation," according to a District realtor. However, this contact reported softening overall housing sales in recent weeks, citing a recent rise in mortgage rates, increased uncertainty generated by the Middle Eastern crisis, and a slowdown in company transfers. The Detroit market was reported to be running below last year's pace in the first half of the year, and slowed further recently.
Although housing prices are holding up relatively well in the Midwest, the rate of increase has slowed substantially in recent months. On the manufacturing side, the price component of the Chicago purchasing manager survey indicated more respondents paying increased prices in August than in July, although the trend was basically unchanged from that in June and July. One District manufacturer of heavy moving equipment reported prices declining in the face of weaker demand. Crop prices have fallen in recent weeks.
