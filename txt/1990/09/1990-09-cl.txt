Department store retailers in this District are less optimistic about sales prospects for the fall season. Most report, however, that sales in August rose from July, but that increases were smaller than in the previous month. Retailers generally expect that price promotions will be necessary to sustain sales over the next few months. Retailers in Cleveland report that their back-to-school sales in August were as good as, or better than, sales last year. Auto retailers report August sales were about as expected, and, in some cases, better than in July. Some report a step-up in consumer interest in fuel-efficient cars, and most dealers report buyers are still leaning toward more expensive rather than mid-priced cars.
According to some auto producers, car sales in August were better than they expected in their pre-oil-shock forecasts. Some believe that the timing of the consumer confidence surveys may have biased the survey results, and expect future surveys to show some recovery in consumer confidence.
The steel industry is still operating at close to effective capacity, and producers report a strong third quarter for orders and production. A producer reports that orders for October are being booked at a good pace. There is a tone of less confidence over the short-term outlook because of uncertainty about the effects of the oil situation on the auto and appliance industries. Steel producers point out that their industry is more energy efficient now than even five years ago. Crude-oil costs are a relatively small part of production costs, but the added fuel cost will hurt already squeezed profit margins because additional costs cannot be passed through to steel consumers.
Some capital-goods producers are less optimistic about short-term output and spending plans, because they expect that the uncertainty over the oil situation will temporarily erode business confidence. Some expect that there could be a temporary deferring, or postponing, of short-lead-time equipment from this year into early next year. They also emphasize that capital stock additions in recent years anticipated real oil prices even higher than at present prices.
Auto production next quarter will likely exceed new car sales, barring work stoppages, but dealers caution about holding inventories and deterioration in consumer confidence are likely to be constraints on auto output plans. Light truck output will be hampered by a 100-day inventory. Heavy-duty truck output is reviving slowly from a trough in late 1989 and early 1990, and output this quarter will likely be the best so far this year.
A major electric power utility in Ohio believes that the effect of the oil-price shock is minimal because their facilities have become marginal users of crude oil. Also, more efficient energy use by the utility's industrial accounts have sharply reduced the effects of oil price increases.
High office and retail vacancy rates in many metropolitan centers, coupled with tightened lending terms, have moved some developers to shift their operations into other kinds of construction. A large shopping mall developer, for example, will increasingly focus on construction of residential communities. Another developer has been moving into apartment construction from office building.
