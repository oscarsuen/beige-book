Auto dealers continue to report that sales were well below levels seen a year ago, especially during the first two weeks of August. Foreign models again sold better than domestic ones. A few dealers indicated consumers are more resistant to the higher priced models and said that sales of new autos priced under $15,000 were comparatively better. Some noted that it was too soon to detect any switch toward more fuel-efficient models.
Growth of consumer loans in July and August was reportedly "anemic." Bankers indicate that demand for auto loans continues to weaken, but they continue to indicate a moderate expansion in home equity lending and single family mortgages.
Weak new and existing home sales continue to impact the southeastern textile industry. Carpet producers indicate demand continues to be soft and that downward price pressures are evident at the wholesale level. They do not anticipate any improvement for some time. New layoffs by southeastern tire producers were reported and an auto assembly plant was closed for a week due to poor orders. Apparel producers note continuing weakness, adding that competition from imports is intense.
