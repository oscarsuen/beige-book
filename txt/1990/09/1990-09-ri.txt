District tourism was lackluster in the last month of the summer season. Our telephone survey of hotels, motels, and resorts indicated a slower August and Labor Day weekend than a year ago. Respondents who experienced declines blamed a generally weaker economy. Only one resort manager thought that higher gasoline prices kept tourists away. Most of those surveyed reported that fall bookings were about even with last year's. Respondents remained optimistic about tourist activity in coming months, but they were less so than in our previous survey.
Virtually all manufacturers were adversely affected by higher crude oil prices. Raw materials prices and transportation costs rose for all but a few respondents. To adjust to these increased expenses, half said they had raised or would raise their prices, a third said they would try to decrease other nonemployment costs, and one-tenth planned to cut employment.
Manufacturers' assessments of current conditions and their forecasts were more pessimistic in August than in July. A larger majority believed that their local economies and the national economy weakened in the latest month, and only one-fifth now expect business conditions to improve in the next six months.
The volume of coal exports has apparently not yet been affected by developments in the Middle East. Some of the largest coal shippers, however, expect to export more if crude oil prices remain high.
The Mideast military deployment slowed business in parts of Virginia and the Carolinas. In areas where large numbers of military and support personnel had been stationed and were sent overseas, local business leaders said that retail sales were off sharply; automobiles, appliances, and fast food were particularly hard hit. Contacts in the Washington area noted that the Mideast crisis diverted defense funds away from local contractors that primarily provide long-term, research-oriented services, and toward items of immediate use in the field. The call-up of reserves and the departure of troops, many of whom held second jobs, depleted the supply of workers in some areas where labor markets were already tight. The Mideast deployment, however, evidently gave a boost to some District manufacturers. A textile producer, for example, recently received a large government order for tent fabric.
