Slowing economies in Canada, Western Europe, and other foreign markets could affect a significant source of expected strength in the District's manufacturing sector. A large District producer of heavy equipment reported continued slowing in unit sales in October and early November in many of its important overseas markets, following the weakness that developed over the summer. Sales growth in Asia has continued at about the same pace recorded in the third quarter, however. A capital goods producer in the District reported solid increases in export sales (in current dollar amounts) in October, but noted continued weakness in some of its foreign subsidiaries' sales. Another large exporter in the District, which produces less cyclically sensitive goods, stated that unit sales volume overseas continued to expand in October and November.
