First District contacts in both retailing and manufacturing report that economic activity in the District was generally below year-earlier levels in October and November. For most retail contacts, sales are running from slightly above to modestly below 1989 figures, but sales of some durable or discretionary items have declined more than 10 percent. Sales of First District manufacturers remain mixed, but most report that orders are flat to down from year-ago levels. Fearing a national recession, most manufacturing respondents are keeping inventories lean, reducing employment and cutting capital spending plans. Retailers, too, have been cautious in preparing for the Christmas season.
Most prices are reported to be fairly stable because weak retail demand requires a promotional stance. However, prices for some metal and plastic hardware products are up as much as 6 percent from last year.
Retail contacts are continuing to pursue cost-control measures. Some are reducing interest expenses by repaying loans. Sellers of durable goods seem especially focused on reducing inventory and employment costs.
The consensus projection for 1991 called for fairly flat sales combined with continued pressures on earnings.
Employment is below year-ago levels at almost all manufacturers contacted. Declines range from slight to as much as 10 percent. Respondents plan no additional lay-offs at this time.
Materials prices are generally reported to be increasingâ€”from gradually to as such as 8 percent for oil-based products. Contacts mentioned price increases for chemical feedstocks, steel, imported inputs, and "shop supplies," such as safety equipment. Most contacts are trying to pass these input price increases on to their customers, but one-third are meeting resistance. Almost half have raised their selling prices by 3 to 5 percent on selected items.
Among firms discussing 1990 capital spending, most describe current expenditures as below-budget. Almost half the firms contacted plan to spend just enough to cover depreciation in 1991. A few firms expect to upgrade their equipment; only one is building a new facility.
First District manufacturers describe themselves as very cautious. The majority expect a national recession lasting two to four quarters. A few respondents report making contingency plans in case the downturn turns out to be longer or deeper than currently anticipated. Several contacts expressed concerns about the implication of current debt levels for the economy.
