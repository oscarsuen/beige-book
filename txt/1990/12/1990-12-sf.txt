Economic growth in the West remains sluggish, and western business leaders' expectations about the national economy continue to deteriorate. Reports suggest that price increases may have moderated in recent weeks. Retail trade activity in the West is mixed, with wide variations by region. Activity in most manufacturing industries is reported to be flat to down front a year ago. Agriculture is one of the stronger sectors in the District, with strong prices and good yields. Lumber orders are down, while oil producers are enjoying the current high level of prices. Construction and real estate activity are down in most parts of the West, but several inland regions report continued strength. While conditions in Twelfth District financial institutions remain generally healthy, some California banks report further softening in major markets.
While one retailer reports a slight increase in inventories, another notes that inventories are in "surprisingly good shape" due to cautious ordering by retailers. No significant changes in the composition of retail orders, in terms of domestic versus imported products, were reported.
Lumber orders are down from a quarter ago and from a year ago. Many mills in the Northwest are cutting back production due to this lack of demand.
Oil producers are enjoying the current high level of prices. In Kern County, California, oil companies are spending money to enhance their wells, but long-term price uncertainty is keeping them from doing much exploration.
Real estate activity, as measured by the number of sales, property values, and rents, continues to weaken in most parts of the West. A southern California developer reports that new leases on office space in some areas are priced 10 to 15 percent below their peak levels. This developer also reports that few commercial properties are being sold, but estimates that the values of the well-leased commercial properties that are changing hands have fallen by as much as 10 to 15 percent as well. At the same time, in California's central valley, the Pacific Northwest, and the inter-mountain states, residential property values continue to exceed their year-earlier levels. Even in markets that are generally lackluster, low-priced homes continue to sell relatively briskly.
