New auto sales are flat to down in most district states. Potential buyers in some areas are having difficulty getting loans as lenders become more selective. Most dealers are trimming inventories in the expectation of weak sales, while still trying to maintain stocks of the new models.
Housing Activity and FinanceHousing starts are generally unchanged from last month, despite weak new home sales across the district. Expectations for sales are mixed, but starts are not expected to increase. Several builders report higher prices for wooden shingles and asphalt roofing. Availability of materials is not a problem, however.
Reports on deposit flows from savings and loan respondents are mixed, with results often dependent on locality and business strategy. Mortgage demand is down and is expected to worsen due to seasonal factors and a weakening economy. Mortgage rates have declined slightly over the last month and are expected to fall further in the months ahead.
The district's winter wheat crop is generally in excellent condition. After an excessively dry planting season in much of the district, plentiful moisture and warm weather have given the new crop a boost.
Crop income prospects for district farmers have weakened in recent months, but livestock income prospects remain bright. Crop prices slumped as the fall harvest season neared completion. Higher oil prices promise to boost crop production expenses and have encouraged farmers to purchase fuel, fertilizers, and other petrochemicals earlier than normal. Crop income subsidies have been cut back in the new government farm program, and participation in the program by district farmers may decline. High cattle and hog prices, however, continue to bolster incomes for district livestock producers.
