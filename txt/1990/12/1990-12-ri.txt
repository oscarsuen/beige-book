Despite the weakness in sales, inventories also apparently declined over the survey period. There was some indication that suppliers were requiring earlier payment for delivered goods. Retail and wholesale prices were reported steady to higher.
Retailers reported unexpectedly strong sales in most major District metropolitan areas during the three days following Thanksgiving. Surveys by the local newspapers in these areas indicated that shopper traffic was very heavy and that business was brisk. Lines of shoppers were reported at some stores that had advertised discounted merchandise.
Raw materials prices rose, but most manufacturers apparently held finished product prices steady. Even firms that use petroleum-based inputs like chemicals and plastics said that they had absorbed sharp increases in their raw material costs and had not increased prices of their finished goods.
Manufacturers saw weakness in current economic conditions, but they were somewhat less pessimistic than a month ago about prospects for business next year. Most respondents believed that economic activity weakened in their local areas and in the nation in early November, and about half expected further weakening in the months ahead. A significantly larger number of respondents in November than in October, however, expected activity to pick up in coming months.
The declining dollar evidently gave a modest boost to some exports. West Virginia's timber industry, for example, enjoyed strong export sales, and exports of coal to overseas markets apparently rose.
The volume of outstanding commercial and industrial loans evidently declined in early November. Lenders reported that the demand for new commercial loans decreased and that borrowers were reluctant to use existing lines of credit. Bankers attributed the weaker demand to the sluggish economy and to the uncertainty resulting from Mideast tensions. Some lenders also indicated that they were taking extra care to ensure that potential borrowers were creditworthy. Nearly all lenders reported no change in their loan rates.
Bankers said they were analyzing loans for new ventures and business expansions more carefully. They indicated, however, that quality customers with sound management and sufficient documentation should find adequate credit available. Even so, some small businesses and real estate developers with strong past repayment records reported that they had not been able to find adequate funds. In some metropolitan areas, loans for real estate development were reported to have dried up and construction activity was described as deeply depressed.
Most livestock producers received relatively high prices and benefited from relatively low feed prices. High production, however, held down lamb prices.
