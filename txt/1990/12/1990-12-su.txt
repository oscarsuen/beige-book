Business conditions are somewhat mixed in different parts of the country but on balance display a weaker pattern. In many of the Federal Reserve districts, economic activity appears to have declined recently while it has remained sluggish or grown slowly in the rest. Several districts report a decline in consumer and business confidence and many refer to expectations of continued diminution in economic activity. Retail sales, adjusted for inflation, appear to have declined below their year-ago levels in almost all districts. Manufacturing conditions have weakened in most districts. However, soft domestic demand has been partially offset by strong export orders. Most districts report continued weakness in construction. Several districts report a decline in business loan demand as well as some tightening of loan standards by banks. In contrast, agriculture is reported to have been doing very well. Crop yields have been good and livestock prices have been high.
Most districts report that retailers were pessimistic about sales prospects for the Christmas season as well as for 1991. However, the Richmond district reports unexpectedly strong sales in metropolitan areas immediately following Thanksgiving, and the Kansas City district reports that retailers expect sales to be steady to moderately improved throughout the Christmas season.
Manufacturers have expressed concern about business prospects for the coming months, The majority of manufacturers contacted in the Boston district expect a national recession lasting two to four quarters. Business leaders contacted in the San Francisco district expect continued deterioration in the national economy. Manufacturers in the Philadelphia district, however, expect modest increases in orders and shipments over the next six months, and manufacturers in the Richmond district were less pessimistic about prospects than they had been a month ago.
Reports of price increases for goods are mixed. San Francisco reports price increases in the 3 to 5 percent range, but Boston reports that materials prices for oil-based products have increased as much as 8 percent. Richmond reports steady finished good prices, even for products using oil-based inputs. Several districts report expectations of discounting by retailers this Christmas season in the face of weak demand.
Oil and gas extraction reports show little change in Dallas or San Francisco and a modest pickup in Kansas City and Minneapolis.
