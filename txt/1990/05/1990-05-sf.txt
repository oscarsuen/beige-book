Economic conditions in the West are little changed. Most reports indicate that western businesses continue to do relatively well, although most respondents still expect slow national growth. War and price increases in the West continue to cluster in the 3 to 5 percent range, although larger price increases as well as price declines also have been reported. Sales of nondurable goods are reported to be continuing at a solid pace. Most reports on service industries are relatively upbeat. Conditions in manufacturing industries seem to be good overall. Current conditions are satisfactory in most resource industries, but signals suggest that activity may slow in the near future. Conditions in western construction and real estate markets remain fundamentally unchanged, with healthy activity reported in most parts of the West. Most bankers in the West report "good" or "stable" conditions.
Wage and price increases in the West continue to have a "central tendency" in the 3 to 5 percent range. Changes in construction costs have a particularly wide range, with bids in the booming Sun Valley market up 12 percent in the past few months, and prospects of slower building activity in the Los Angeles area reducing bids there by as much as 15 percent in the last eight months. Wage pressures seem relatively intense in Hawaii, where a recently negotiated hotel workers' contract calls for average increases of 10 percent per year over the next five years, and bus driven recently settled on a new contract with wages up 7 percent. Grain prices have fallen substantially, while health care cost increases continue to flirt with the double-digit range. Timber and paper prices appear to have stabilized.
Most reports on service industries are relatively upbeat. However, a publisher reports that help-wanted advertising has fallen significantly during recent weeks, with a recent dropoff noted in advertising for health care positions.
A southern California developer reports that major properties seem to be selling at a slower pace, probably due to extra caution on the part of buyers. At this point, the dropoff in buyer interest has been most noticeable for buildings whose quality does not warrant a Class A rating.
There currently is little evidence of a "credit crunch" in the Twelfth District. Most contacts indicate that they have neither experienced recent changes in credit conditions, nor are aware of others that have experienced significant changes. However, more stringent regulatory limits on the amount that one borrower can receive from a single lender are reported to he restraining lending activity in some cases. Moreover, about a fifth of the contacts report that lenders they regularly deal with have increased collateral requirements on new loans, increased required down payments, shortened loan terms, or otherwise tightened lending policies.
