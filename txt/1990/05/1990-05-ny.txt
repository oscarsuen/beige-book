Developments in the Second District economy since the last report have again been mixed, with no clear signs of overall strengthening or weakening. Homebuilders report some increased buyer interest with the arrival of spring, and the pace of office leasing has been good in many areas. Sales results at District department stores were mixed, however, in recent weeks and unemployment rates showed little change. Most officers at small and medium-sized banks noted an over-the-year weakening in commercial loan demand.
In general, women's apparel continued to be the strongest selling item with some retailers noting a pickup in men's apparel as well. Sales of furniture and some furnishings tended to be sluggish, however, though one contact reported strong demand for floor covering and bedding. Inventories are generally on target, due in part to cautious stocking for the spring season. Merchandise is reportedly still below desired levels at some Campeau stores, though most suppliers have now resumed shipments to them. With the recently begun liquidation of yet another District department store chain and the closing of many small Financial District stores in the wake of the cutbacks in that area, some contacts expressed concern about the local retail industry.
The pace of office leasing has recently been good in much of the District, with tenants reportedly availing themselves of generous landlord concessions. However, as substantial amounts of both new and existing space continued to be marketed, Manhattan office vacancy rates moved somewhat higher. As a result, reactions have been mixed to the announcement that, after a six-year legal battle, New York State has finally acquired most of the 13-acre site for the redevelopment of the Times square area. While the transformation of that badly deteriorated area is generally applauded, many critics are apprehensive because the plan includes the addition of four more large office towers in the midtown area.
The March survey or Buffalo purchasing managers showed an increase in the percentage or firms reporting improvement or stability in production and new orders. Eighty percent of the managers noted stable input prices, up from 64 percent in February. The Department of Labor study mentioned above cited Buffalo as one of three metropolitan areas in which most of New York State's job growth occurred in 1989.
Reports from firms in the Second District suggest that in most instances operations have not been affected by any shift toward more restrictive lending practices. While some manufacturers and homebuilders noted a withdrawing of credit lines and increased collateral requirements, others, especially in upstate and western New York, have seen little or no evidence of credit tightening.
