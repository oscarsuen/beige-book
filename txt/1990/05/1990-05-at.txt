Few employers reported any new wage pressures, and most indicate that they are seeing wage increases of about 5 percent at most. The cost of employee health benefits, however, remains high and is still increasing.
Apparel producers report that they expect their sales to increase as consumers spend less on autos and other durable goods. A carpet manufacturer expects 1990 to be a good year for the carpet industry because replacement demand should continue to support sales. He explained that carpet tends to be replaced in roughly ten-year cycles. Because 1979 was a very strong year, they are now seeing increases in replacement demand.
Contacts in the aerospace industry expect an increase in layoffs as a result of budget reductions at the Department of Defense. Firms in Georgia and Florida reported the largest cutbacks in employment. Aerospace firms related to the space program, however, report increased hiring as a result of renewed growth. Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana are gaining jobs as a result.
Auto dealers note that sales have been slightly below year-ago levels recently. But because they have been able to reduce their inventories and, therefore, interest costs, several large dealers said that profits are up over last year. A few dealers expect that sales will be up slightly this year, and some dealers noted that a few popular models are in short supply. Nevertheless, contacts continue to report that small dealers, particularly those in nonmetropolitan areas, are not doing well and that many have gone out of business.
Developers and builders across the District pointed out that it is becoming more difficult to obtain financing for new real estate projects. Much of the reluctance on the part of lenders has been a response to overbuilt markets, but builders are now saying the increased surveillance by the Comptroller of the Currency is adding to the already cautious lending attitudes.
Exports of coal, kaolin, wood pulp, and chemicals are reported to be holding steady or increasing. Few contacts indicated that the recent strengthening of the dollar had affected their exports substantially. They pointed out that the reliability of U.S. suppliers and long-term contracts are more important in determining the volume of exports than are short-term movements in exchange rates.
Recent cold weather has delayed planting of some crops and has damaged some of the new peach and apple crops. Farmers expect to increase substantially the acreage devoted to cotton while reducing soybean acreage. On balance, southeastern farmers plan to return a large share of idle land to production because of higher prices for cotton and some grains.
