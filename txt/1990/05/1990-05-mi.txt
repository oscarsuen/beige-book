Ninth District economic conditions have been moderately good lately. Labor markets have been fairly tight, but wage and price increases have been moderate. Retail sales have been strong, but new car sales have been slow. Credit conditions have tightened moderately. Resource-related industries have generally been doing well. However, farmers still fear that, without good spring rains, another drought is possible.
Wage and price increases have remained moderate in the district, except for continued high growth in health care costs. Recent and prospective increases in minimum wages are not expected to have much of an impact here because shortages of entry-level workers and teenagers have already forced up their wages.
New car sales have continued to be soft, but the used car market is reportedly strong. Most district dealers report that, even with the softness in new car sales, they are doing considerably better than the nationwide figures suggest.
Housing sales have showed considerable variation around the district. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, housing sales were 15.4 percent higher than a year ago in March alone and 16.2 percent higher than a year ago in the first quarter. In parts of North Dakota, however, housing markets are said to be very slow and prices sharply lower. The number of new housing permits issued in Minnesota in February was 11 percent lower than a year earlier. Much of this decline is concentrated in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where the number of new permits fell 21 percent.
Tourist activity has also been varied across the district. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the ski season was shortened by a somewhat earlier-than-normal melting of snow. Most contacts report that they are optimistic about tourism prospects for the summer. The legalization of gambling in Deadwood, South Dakota, has caused property values there to increase several times over.
Farmers in most of the district are still concerned about the lack of soil moisture. The one bright spot is Montana, where recent rains are reported to have increased soil moisture to the best level in several years. Winter wheat losses have been smaller than feared, thanks to a mild winter. Cattle prices are now reported to be high, and ranchers are generally optimistic about their prospects for the rest of the year. Rental rates for pastureland are said to have risen sharply. Land prices in the district are continuing their steady recovery from the depressed levels of a few years ago.
