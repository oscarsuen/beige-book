Economic growth in the Eighth District continues to be sluggish, a characterization similar to those presented in our reports since April 1989. Consumer spending appears to be flat or up only slightly. The manufacturing sector is still weakening, while the construction and service sectors show slow growth. Export activity has been mixed. More widespread tightening of credit appears to exist in the District.
Numerous plant closings, layoffs and production slowdown have been reported in recent months. For example, firms producing shoes, women's apparel, school supplies, fabricated metal products and home insulation have reduced their output. Auto-related manufacturing remains generally stagnant with suppliers of auto components such as seats, fuel lines and vacuum harnesses cutting production. The workweek for those assembling minivans, however, continues to lengthen reflecting the strong demand for these vehicles.
Manufacturers producing primary metals, machinery and chemicals report flat to declining exports in 1990, relative to 1989. Exports of fabricated metal products were mixed. Contacts in the lumber, food products and coal mining industries report higher exports in the early part of 1990, relative to 1989, with increased exports to East Bloc countries contributing to the increase in lumber and food product exports.
Commercial real estate lending is the notable exception to overall growth in real estate lending, and has been sharply curtailed by District banks in recent months. Lending terms and underwriting standards have tightened considerably, reflecting pressure from examiners to strengthen banks' real estate portfolios and the generally sluggish economy.
