Surveys of purchasing managers in the District showed improvements in production, but a mixed pattern in orders. Chicago's survey indicated a steady increase in the number of firms expanding production since the beginning of the year. Firms receiving more new orders also outnumbered firms receiving fewer new orders. Both Milwaukee's and Indianapolis' survey showed expanding production last quarter. However, in the March survey Milwaukee had the number of firms with lower production equaling the number with higher production. Similarly, after indicating increasing orders in January and February, Milwaukee's March survey indicated that the number of firms receiving fewer new orders outnumbered the firms receiving more new orders. Indianapolis' and Detroit's survey also showed declining orders in the first quarter.
Capital goods producers generally reported improving orders and sales. A producer of a wide range of capital goods noted that sales began to improve in February and orders have been strengthening since the beginning of the year, led by petroleum equipment and food machinery. Other special industry machinery orders were up slightly, with the exception of automotive service equipment which has been weak for over six months. An economist in the communications equipment industry cited an increase in orders across a variety of products and expects double-digit growth in the near future. An uptick in orders for electronic components, however, may be due to fears of shortages, which have led to double ordering, according to an industry analyst. Sales of farm and construction equipment continue to be extremely good, according to a industry economist. Farm equipment sales are very strong, particularly combines and large tractors. Construction equipment sales have also been holding up, despite sluggish housing and shopping center construction nationally. The economist noted that sales in that company's Midwest market have been showing solid gains.
Several contacts cited special factors that may be hampering construction. A financial analyst stated that builders are in need of new sources of loans, because savings and loan institutions are "out of the market." A steel producer noted some slowing in orders from the construction industry that may reflect delays in projects due to financing problems. And, an equipment supplier also noted that some plant construction, particularly in the chemical industry, is being held back until environmental regulations are finalized.
The housing market is showing some signs of weakening. A bank economist cited a softening in Chicago's real estate loan market, especially for mid-to-high priced homes. Mortgage rates have moved above 10 percent at most lending institutions in the area and some banks have started tightening credit terms. Available funds for new construction are being absorbed mostly by single-family housing units, with few funds going to multi-family units, according to one financial analyst. A supplier to the mobile home industry reported sharp sales declines in most regions of the country, including the District. However, one bank economist noted that housing prices in the District have risen more closely in line with personal income than in other regions, which has contributed to a stronger housing market here than in the nation on average.
