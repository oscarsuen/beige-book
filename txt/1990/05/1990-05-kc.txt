Most banks report loan-deposit ratios unchanged or up from last month. Deposit activity was mixed at district banks. Levels of NOWs, MMDAs, IRAs, and Keoghs were constant at most banks, while demand deposits and large CDs were down at many banks.
Credit standards at district agricultural banks are generally steady. Credit is readily available to creditworthy farm borrowers, with repayment capacity a key lending condition. Some bankers in areas affected by the past two years of drought, however, report a modest tightening of credit standards on farm loans. Where the drought was especially severe, some farm loans restructured during the mid-1980s have required additional attention. Across most of the district, however, bankers report no undue problems with previously restructured farm loans.
The performance of rural nonfarm businesses in the Tenth District varies widely. Most are stable, but some are growing moderately and others are declining slowly. Those rural nonfarm businesses dependent on agriculture have benefited from the improved performance of the farm economy.
