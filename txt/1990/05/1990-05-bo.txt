First District economic activity continues at a slow pace. Manufacturing activity varies considerably by industry, but most contacts report slowing orders compared with previous months. Retail sales have stabilized, but respondents expect another difficult year. Residential real estate markets remain slow, with sizable inventories of unsold homes. According to industry contacts and media accounts, small businesses are experiencing (or anticipate) difficulty securing credit.
Although retail conditions in the region remain very competitive and highly promotional, inventory levels are generally in line, and less distress merchandise is reaching the marketplace. Profits, on balance, are lower than last year's levels.
Some First District retailers find wholesale prices rising at a steady pace, while others report some acceleration. In contrast to the mid-April CPI reading, the panel reports no significant increases in apparel prices. However, prices for health and beauty aids and pharmaceuticals have accelerated in recent months.
Labor markets continue to loosen, especially at the managerial level. Wage increases have moderated to a 4 percent annual pace.
Retailers found 1959 to be a difficult year and generally expect 1990 to be similar. However, most contacts do not anticipate any further deterioration.
In the face of anemic business conditions, selling prices are flat to down at a majority of contacts. By contrast, two firms raised prices by 5 to 8 percent on selected products and hope to introduce similar increases on other lines later this year. All contacts report that materials prices are stable or falling. Among firms discussing profit margins, improvements exceed declines.
Regional employment levels are stable to down. One firm that had hoped to reduce employment gradually through attrition has already had two lay-offs. Two recent wage settlements resulted in a 5 percent and a 3 1/2 percent wage increase for 1990.
Capital spending plans vary. Half of the firms expect significant declines from year-ago levels, and two firms have recently cut back on projects planned for 1990. Elsewhere, capital spending should continue at 1989 levels or increase by as much as 25 percent.
Most respondents view the prospects for 1990 with concern. They expect very slow growth throughout the nation, not just within the region, and a few have downgraded their outlook on the basis of first quarter sales. Although most contacts believe that their firms are on solid ground, few expect to make much headway during 1990.
