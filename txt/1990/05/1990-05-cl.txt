With both the level of sales and profits better than expected last quarter, retailers appear guardedly optimistic about near-term prospects. There is some concern, however, that some sales last quarter may borrow from the second quarter, and that demand for household goods may soften because of further weakening in housing. In general, retail economists still expect about a 2% increase in real consumer spending this year from last.
Auto producers and dealers have mixed reports on sales and prospects. For some, retail sales in February and March rebounded enough to bring inventories down to a desired level. April sales so far have been soft despite generous incentives. Dealers report floor plan costs have been held down because of smaller inventories this year than last, and some report shortages for some mid-sized cars. Profits are still being strained because incentives and marketing costs are said to average as much as $1200 per car and are considerably higher for mid-sized cars. Incentives on some Japanese cars have increased by about $500.00.

Small business firms in the District reported no awareness of credit restraints, although perceptions are that some lenders are tightening credit standards. Only one small business firm reported that banks are not lending, especially for commercial real estate because of depressed prices due to high vacancy rates. Several new car dealers reported some tightening in credit standards by both banks and thrifts.
Small builders apparently have not been shut off from credit, although FIRREA legislation has made it more difficult to obtain sufficient credit from a single lender. Thrifts contacted assert there is no lack of funds in the mortgage market for qualified builders and buyers, and reported that their loan volume so far this year exceeds the same period last year. They acknowledged that the 15% limit on loans is an inconvenience to some builders and developers. Several banks in the District also reported that their loans so far this year exceed last year, although some tightening in credit standards has taken place in view of rising office vacancy rates, foreclosures, and nonperforming real estate loans.
