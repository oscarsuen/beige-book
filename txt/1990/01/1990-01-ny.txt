The Second District economy has continued to show little change from the mixed patterns described in other recent reports. Sales results at department stores were uneven in what retailers described as an unusually competitive environment, and homebuilding activity was seasonally slow. Unemployment rates in New York and New Jersey moved in opposite directions and office vacancy rates also varied. Most officers of small to medium-sized banks reported an over-the-year decline in demand for many types of bank credit.
In general, women's apparel remained the strongest selling item. However, with the arrival of unusually cold temperatures in November, retailers also experienced strong demand for outerwear, leather goods, sweaters and down comforters. Some contacts mentioned a pickup in sales of furniture and home furnishings following earlier softness. Due in large part to the heavy promotional activity in recent weeks, inventories are generally at desired levels with the major exception of the reportedly understocked Campeau-owned chains which some manufacturers are reluctant to supply.
While office leasing activity in Manhattan was reported brisk in recent weeks, substantial amounts of additional space were placed on the market by consolidating and restructuring firms. As a result, vacancy rates for primary space in both midtown and downtown Manhattan rose and some observers anticipate further increases as buildings now under construction are completed. Office vacancy rates remain high in some of the District's suburban areas but, for the most part, have stabilized or declined recently due to a slowdown in new construction.
The percentage of Buffalo purchasing managers reporting improved new orders rose sharply in December but continued to be surpassed by firms reporting a decline. The number of firms reporting greater production increased slightly but was also surpassed by those with declining output.
Among recent developments in the District, Ford Motor Co. announced a $200 million modernization plan for its Buffalo stamping plant and the Newark Housing Authority unveiled plans for a $400 million riverfront project to be built in the downtown area with construction to begin this year. On a less positive note, tax revenues throughout the District are falling short of expectations and both New York City and New York State face sizable budget deficits in their current fiscal years.
