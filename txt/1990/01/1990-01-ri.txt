OverviewDistrict economic activity was mixed in December and early January after a sluggish November. Retail sales before and after Christmas were generally good. The slowdown in manufacturing, however, became more pronounced. Activity at District ports was again mixed. Housing activity rose in December despite the inclement weather, and business was strong at ski resorts. In agriculture, winter wheat suffered some weather-related stress.
District manufacturers were more optimistic in January than in November about prospects for growth in their businesses, and they remained optimistic about growth in the nation during the next six months. Respondents who expect increases in shipments, new orders, employment, and the length of the workweek outnumbered those who expect decreases. Most producers continued to project slow-to-moderate economic growth over the next 18 months.
