Prices of raw materials are said to be soft with the exception of fuel. A plastics producer says he expects the prices of bulk chemicals and resins to continue falling. Metal prices are reported to be stable or, in the case of aluminum, falling slowly. A builder reports that the prices of construction materials are generally softer than last year. Airlines, trucking firms and energy producers have noted sharply higher fuel prices, although some felt that the increases were the result of the recent cold snap and therefore, temporary.
Southeastern auto dealers continue to report that unit sales are down between 10 and 50 percent compared to last year. Several noted that the greater use of five year loans to finance cars in recent years has cut into current demand, especially for smaller models. They believe that lengthened maturity of these loans has not allowed car owners to build up enough equity to trade in for a new model. Other dealers pointed out that consumers have become accustomed to rebates and are much more price conscious than in the past.
Industrial construction along the Gulf coast continues to expand. Several large natural gas processing plants are reportedly planned for the Mobile area; and several others are expanding capacity. Several contacts noted an increase in the number of active drilling rigs in the Gulf, and they believe that the increase is permanent.
Some manufacturers of apparel, paper, and heating equipment report that they are installing computerized inventory control systems, which they expect to smooth production runs and control costs. New or expanded health care facilities have been announced in northern Florida and in Birmingham, Alabama. Several producers of heavy machinery and construction equipment report that they scaled back capital spending in 1989 and have planned no capital expansion for 1990.
Many lenders reported slower mortgage growth than at this time a year ago. Single family mortgage delinquencies are also increasing according to several bankers. In spite of lower mortgage rates, they do not expect much rebound in extensions in the next several months.
Commercial real estate loans were also down across the District. Contacts reported lenders' pre-lease requirements for new office projects have increased during the year.
