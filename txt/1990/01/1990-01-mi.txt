Consumer spending on general merchandise has been strong, automobile sales have continued to show large month-to-month fluctuations, and automobile inventories have been at unusually high levels. Resource-related industries have been doing moderately well.
Automobile sales have continued to show large month-to-month fluctuations. A domestic manufacturer reports that car sales in the region in December were 8 percent lower than a year ago, while truck sales were 13 percent higher. This manufacturer also reports that regional car sales for all of 1989 were 3 percent higher than in 1988. Inventories of cars and trucks have continued to be at unusually high levels, but it is anticipated that by March inventories will return to normal.
Housing activity has been largely unchanged from last year's levels. The number of new housing permits issued in Minnesota rose by 4 percent in November from last year, but the number of new housing permits issued in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area fell by 11 percent over the same period. Housing sales in this metropolitan area in December were 7.4 percent higher than in December 1988, but sales for the entire year of 1989 were roughly unchanged from 1988 levels. Construction activity levels were also roughly unchanged from a year ago. The dollar value of contracts for future construction in November was about 5 percent higher than in November 1988.
Tourist spending has been moderately strong. Montana reports an outstanding year, with reservations at ski resorts up anywhere from 10 to 20 percent over last year. The Upper Peninsula of Michigan also reports good snowfall and an excellent tourist season. Elsewhere in the district, snowfall has been below normal and ski resorts report a disappointing season. In Deadwood, South Dakota, gambling was recently legalized and the amounts wagered have exceeded all expectations.
