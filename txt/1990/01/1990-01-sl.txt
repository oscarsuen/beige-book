A large home appliance plant in Arkansas, which laid off most of its work force in November because of slow sales and production line changes, is scheduled to resume production in February. A company official anticipates unit appliance sales in 1990 will be flat or slightly lower than last year. A home appliance firm in Louisville expects strengthening sales late in 1990 and plans to hire as many as 300 new production workers.
