Despite severely cold temperatures in late December, most district cattle feeders marketed cattle on a normal schedule. Faster weight gains during unseasonably warm temperatures early in December helped compensate for the slower weight gains caused by colder temperatures later in the month. High cattle prices have boosted feeding margins and encouraged some district producers to feed cattle to heavier weights than usual.
Strong returns from both livestock and crops allowed most district farmers to pay off 1989 operating loans at a rate similar to that of a year ago. In parts of Oklahoma and Kansas, however, continued drought and an early frost cut crop yields and boosted carry-over farm debt. Nevertheless, most district banks have little unwanted carry-over debt and are actively seeking new farm loan accounts to increase loan-deposit ratios. In general, agriculture's strong financial performance in recent years has encouraged district bankers to expand farm lending activity.
