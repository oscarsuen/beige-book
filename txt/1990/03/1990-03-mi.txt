Ninth District conditions are moderately good, and the general tone here is one of cautious optimism. Labor markets are still tight but manageable. Wage and price increases remain moderate in most district markets. Spending on general merchandise has been fairly strong during the first two months of this year, but car sales and construction activity has been generally lackluster. Resource-related industries have been doing quite well generally. However, concern about a lack of moisture is widespread. Unless spring brings precipitation across the Upper Midwest, another serious drought is possible.
Wage and price increases remain moderate. Wage increases in the 3 - 5 percent range are reported in most district industries. However, sharp increases in health care costs are prevalent. In some recent settlements, these costs have almost entirely absorbed employee compensation gains. High gasoline costs are causing problems for some district truckers and loggers, but gas prices appear to have peaked in mid-1989; they have modestly declined since then. This Bank's directors note that capital equipment price hikes are running in the 3-6 percent range, except in the paper industry, where they are a bit higher. One director reports modest increases in material costs.
The agricultural sector has one or two bright spots in the Ninth District. Dairy prices dropped sharply in February, but until then had been running at record highs. A director reports that Wisconsin dairy operators are investing in equipment improvement. Cattle ranchers in Montana have benefited from excellent prices, good grass, and generally benign weather conditions.
Still, there is great concern in much of the district about a lack of soil moisture. The effects, so far, have been limited. Winter wheat losses due to lack of snow cover have been less than feared, thanks to relatively mild weather. However, most areas report below-normal precipitation. Since most areas are still recovering from drought, groundwater levels are typically very low. In parts of Minnesota, shallow wells have gone dry, and the state has recently reconvened its task force on drought. Many district lakes are at extremely low levels, and fishing, which is a major summer tourist attraction, is likely to suffer.
In sum, most of the Ninth District needs water badly. If precipitation comes when farmers need it and the weather cooperates thereafter (which is what happened last year), the agricultural sector could still do quite well. However, the risk of significant drought problems in 1990 cannot be ignored.
