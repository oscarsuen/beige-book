On the other hand, retailers report flat prices due in part to heavy promotions. Prices for forest products have been flat to down during the past year, with newsprint prices down 10 to 15 percent from their year-earlier level. Aluminum and copper prices also are down. A surplus of premium wine "in the pipeline" is expected to lead to lower prices within the next two years.
Car dealers report that customer traffic is down in February, particularly for used cars. Traffic and sales are off for both domestic and import dealers, but weakness is more pronounced on the domestic side. Sales are reported to be much stronger when incentives are available, and fall sharply when incentives are lifted.
The price of gold has been fluctuating in a narrow range and remains at a level that makes production quite profitable. Consequently, production at District gold mines, particularly in Nevada, continues at high levels.
Restriction on timber-cutting from US Forest Service lands continues to make logs scarce and expensive. Some firms have closed mills and laid off workers because they are unable to produce profitably. Allowable cuttings are expected to be cut further in coming years.
Construction and Real EstateResidential construction and real estate activity continue healthy in most of the West, but conditions in nonresidential markets are more mixed. Northwestern cities are seeing strong building activity and relatively low vacancy rates in most markets. Some observers consider segments of the Los Angeles and San Francisco area markets to be somewhat overbuilt, although respondents indicate that problems are unlikely to be serious unless rates of absorption fall below their current levels. The office vacancy rate in Phoenix continues to rise, since the volume of new space coming on line is outpacing absorption. A nationwide retailer reports that bids for construction of new shopping facilities come in at very competitive prices in Phoenix, but that in California and Washington it is hard to get bidders, and current contract prices are about 10 to 12 percent higher than their year-earlier level.
Some builders and developers report that they are finding it more difficult to obtain financing since the thrift bailout began. The new limits on loans to one borrower are having a particularly significant effect on some builders. As a result, some projects that otherwise would have been built are being curtailed. One respondent notes that well-financed developers seem to be proceeding on the theory that their projects will be delivered when others are unable to find financing.
