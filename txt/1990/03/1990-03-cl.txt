Respondents in the Fourth District expect a slightly improved pace at overall economic activity this quarter from last. They expect some let-up in food and energy prices, but a 4 percent underlying inflation rate is expected to persist, at least for the next several quarters. The worst of the slowdown in manufacturing activity is believed to have passed. Interest rates are still expected to ease over the next few months, but not as much as was thought a few weeks ago.
The latest spurt in food prices was partly in response to the freeze last December. Produce, milk, and processed fruit and vegetable prices are easing. Some other prices, however, including cereals, some dairy products, and coffee, all rose much more than expected last quarter, and have been sticky on the downside. If those prices ease more, overall food prices could increase in a 4 percent to 4 1/2 percent range this year, similar to recent years, according to an industry source.
Despite the expected easing in food and energy prices, the prevailing view is that inflation will hold at about a 4 percent rate over the next several quarters.
Purchasing managers in Cleveland and Cincinnati report higher output and production for the second consecutive month in February, and commodity prices in the Cincinnati area firmed for the first time in the last eight months.
Some of the cautiously optimistic tone about manufacturing stems from the auto industry. New car inventories have been brought down substantially since year-end 1989 and should be in a normal range by the end of March. Production in February and March is expected to rise to about a 6 million to 6.5 million unit annual rate from the 4.1 million rate in January. Dealers in the Fourth District expect to step up orders for second quarter delivery because of their improving inventory condition. Big Three auto dealers attribute the better sales level of this quarter than last to the incentive programs. Although they report that captive finance companies have been tightening credit standards in response to the high percentage of loan defaults last year, they believe commercial banks are still making credit readily available for both consumers and dealers.
Steel producers continue to operate at about 80% of capacity. Production is expected to increase next quarter because of rising seasonal demands, some pickup in the auto industry, and less inventory liquidation by steel warehouses. Spot prices are described as weak, and prices in export markets are so depressed that some domestic producers have decided to withdraw from that market.
Profit margins in manufacturing have been deteriorating, especially in the auto and related industries and in computer and office machinery industries, and are characterized by some as recession margins. The erosion, however, doesn't necessarily imply a retrenchment in capital spending. A steel producer reported that modernization plans are still on schedule, and a capital goods producer pointed out that cash flow is a key to investment.
