Most employers reported that wages have been rising at roughly the rate of inflation. A few shortages of skilled workers were mentioned. A builder in the Jacksonville area said that skilled construction workers were in short supply. Several contractors and oil-rig operators in Louisiana also continue to report shortages of skilled workers.
Most retailers said they were having no trouble with deliveries from their suppliers. Several added that their suppliers had been giving them a better selection of products at lower prices.
Textile and apparel producers report no further weakening from last month, while paper producers report that business is up somewhat compared to a year ago. One contact revealed that his backlog of orders currently is up 30 percent over the same period last year. Another reports continued strong shipments of boxes and linerboard. Two producers in Mississippi noted that their firms have recently modernized and increased efficiency. One felt that the improvements would help their competitiveness overseas.
Several auto dealers explained that the uptick in sales in January was unexpected and that sales in February were again weak. Most dealers said they do not expect much improvement for the rest of 1990. Almost all dealers indicated that excess inventories have been successfully worked down and now stand at levels lower than last year at this time.
Residential construction was strong in January, but several builders said that this was due to unseasonably warm weather and are expecting declines in new starts and building permits. Many contacts are reporting that desired reductions in inventories of residential units are just beginning, particularly in Tennessee and Louisiana. They do not expect construction to pick up much until 1991.
The disposition of the RTC's residential assets was frequently mentioned as adding to uncertainty in real estate markets. Several developers stated that it is now more difficult to get bank financing, and they expect that new capital requirements and limits on how much a particular savings and loan can lend to a developer will keep the supply of loans tight. They added, however, that most of the tightness in lending has so far been the result of overbuilt markets rather than of the savings and loan problem.
Oil drilling continues to expand slowly. Domestic producers are reporting that they are shifting their exploration budgets more towards natural gas.
