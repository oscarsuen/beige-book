Spring credit reviews reveal greater strength in farm incomes for livestock producers than for cash grain farmers. Dry growing conditions lowered dryland crop yields and increased irrigation costs for grain producers. Reduced yields, smaller government payments, and lower crop prices combined to lower cash-grain income. Low feed costs and high livestock prices, however, bolstered income for livestock producers. Ranchers have postponed herd rebuilding in favor of selling feeder cattle to feedlot operators at high prices. While dry weather has limited pasture development in parts of the district, cheap grain and mostly plentiful forage supplies have reduced feed costs for most cattle producers.
