Economic activity appears to have grown slowly in most Federal Reserve districts since early August, but seems to have declined somewhat in others. Many districts reported a weakening in business and consumer confidence. Retail sales, including new car sales, were sluggish or down in most of the country. Indicators of manufacturing activity were mixed to weaker. Commercial and residential construction declined, although sales of homes rose in some areas. Total loan demand at commercial banks was lackluster, and business lending decreased across the nation. In agriculture, crop yields and livestock prices were generally strong, although various factors detracted from farm sector conditions in some areas. With respect to energy, higher oil prices appeared to be stimulating oil drilling, although some shortages of skilled workers were reported.
Most districts reported that retailers were generally pessimistic about their sales prospects in coming months. The retailers blamed lower consumer confidence brought on by greater uncertainty and higher fuel prices for the current and expected weakness in their sales. Some worried that they would have to discount prices significantly to move merchandise.
Manufacturers in several districts were concerned about their business prospects in the coming months. Some planned further reductions in employment and were cautious about their capital spending plans.
Housing starts were reported to be down in most districts, but home sales registered increases in several. Six districts noted general weakness in residential construction, although multi-family activity was higher in the Dallas district. Home sales rose in at least parts of five districts, but Atlanta and San Francisco reported general declines.
Some districts commented on home prices. Atlanta and San Francisco indicated that the median home price had declined from a year ago. New York attributed unsold homes to unrealistic pricing.
Three districts reported on farm lending activity. Kansas City reported that the demand for agricultural loans rose, and Chicago and Richmond reported a good pace of repayments on agricultural loans.
