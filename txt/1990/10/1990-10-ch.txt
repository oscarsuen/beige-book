Auto sales continue to show surprising strength, although car buyers still expect rebates. One of the largest motor vehicle dealers in the Seventh District reported continued sales growth in September and early October, with little change in mix. The dealer attributed some of the strength to aggressive promotion and market-share gains. However, heavily leveraged dealers are increasingly cautious in committing to inventory and promotions. An economist for a major domestic automaker stated that dealers continue to receive much of their inventory financing from auto producers, but are ordering cautiously. This contact also noted that there was little evidence of substitution of cars for light trucks since the oil price increase. Still, a soft economy is expected to reduce car and truck sales by about a half a million units (at a seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the fourth quarter from earlier expectations, according to this economist.
Area purchasing managers' surveys exhibit mixed conditions. The index produced by the Chicago area survey showed expansion in September, compared to the decline indicated by the national survey. In contrast, the Milwaukee and Detroit surveys showed weakening activity in September. One contact suggested that the Detroit weakness was due in large part to uncertainty prior to the resolution of labor negotiations between auto producers and the UAW.
Several District sources reported that exports, which have been a significant contributor to the relative strength in the Midwest economy, showed signs of softening recently. An analyst with a manufacturer of moving equipment stated that retail sales of its products outside of the United States had weakened over the past two to three months. An economist with a major manufacturer of agricultural equipment reported that overseas sales also had begun to trend downward in recent months, particularly in much of Europe. On the other hand, a large District manufacturer of equipment and supplies reported that export growth was continuing.
A Chicago real estate agent described the local housing market as "surprisingly strong." While homes are on the market longer and prices are not rising as fast as a year ago, sellers and holding firm on price, according to the realtor, and volume is still up over last year. One large realtor reported that first-time home buyers may be more active recently, calling it a 'buyers market', in part because mortgage rates are relatively low.
