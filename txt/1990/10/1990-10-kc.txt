Most district savings and loan respondents report net outflows of deposits over the last month and expect additional outflows in the near term. Mortgage demand is down and is expected to weaken further due to seasonal factors, a weaker economy, and stable to higher mortgage rates. Respondents exhibit considerable uncertainty about the future direction of mortgage rates.
Winter wheat planting is proceeding on schedule in most of the district, and the new wheat crop is developing nicely. But wheat planting was delayed by dry soil conditions in western Oklahoma and southern Kansas and by the late harvest of soybeans from double-cropped acreage in Missouri. Low wheat prices are expected to maintain a high rate of participation in the government price-support program despite anticipated cuts in support levels.
While lower crop prices and reduced support levels may restrain farm income growth, high cattle prices continue to support strong incomes for district cattle producers. In response to high prices, most district ranchers are choosing to sell feeder cattle instead of feeding them to heavier weights or retaining them for breeding herds. High fed cattle prices and low feedgrain prices are offsetting the effect of high feeder cattle prices on cattle feeding margins. As a result, most district feedlots are operating at capacity.
