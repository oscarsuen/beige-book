Some public officials are concerned that Ohio could have a budget deficit of as much as $300 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1991, partly because of a revenue shortfall.
Auto dealers in the District report, however, that new car sales in September were slightly better than in August, probably because of year-end clearance of 1990 models, and they also report rather "good" sales of 1991 models. Dealers do not note a marked shift in consumer buying toward more fuel-efficient cars. Orders for 1990:IVQ are reported to be at least equal to 1989:IVQ, and many anticipate order increases in late November and December for 1991:IQ delivery.
Steel operations have continued at nearly 85% of capacity, supported by a continued decline in steel imports, and strength in machinery and agricultural industries that have compensated for softness in autos and appliances.

Home sales in the $150,000 to $200,000 price range have slowed, but are still generally strong in the $250,000 to $400,000 range, although some builders and lenders report a virtual standstill in activity in some high-growth suburban communities. In general, sales of existing homes averaged about 95% of the asking price in September, which has hardly changed from a year earlier.
