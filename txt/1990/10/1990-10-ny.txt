Developments in the Second District economy show continued weakness since the last report. Retail sales contacts report a year-over-year decline for the second consecutive month. Residential construction remains weak in much of the District. The market for office space, while soft, appears to have improved slightly. Unemployment rates rose during September, but are below the national average. Several major New York City employers plan substantial layoffs. Respondents at small and medium-sized banks were equally divided between those reporting credit tightening and those whose willingness to extend credit has not changed.
Changes in comparable store sales—which exclude the effect of stores opened during the year—ranged from -7.2 percent to -14.0 percent between September 1989 and September 1990. The weakness in sales was broadly spread across most categories of goods, with home furnishings and childrenswear sales showing particularly sharp declines. Sales of women's higher-priced apparel remained strong, however. Reports on inventories were mixed, with some stores reporting above-plan inventories and modest inventory cuts while others reported inventories slightly below plan.
Three consecutive months of strong leasing activity caused midtown Manhattan's primary vacancy rate to fall for the first time this year. With only 700,000 square feet of additional space scheduled for completion in 1990, the midtown vacancy rate is expected to decline further over the next few months. Downtown Manhattan vacancy rates remained roughly stable as average asking rental rates declined. The market for office space elsewhere in the New York City metropolitan area was soft but generally stable.
Many recent job losses have been concentrated in the New York City metropolitan area. Last month, Pan Am cut 1,200 area workers and Chase Manhattan announced the layoff of 5,000 predominantly local employees. This month, Saks announced that it would cut approximately 350 employees from its New York corporate headquarters. On the other hand, in Central New York, more than 3,000 jobs were created with the opening of Syracuse's Carousel Mall and an additional 340 positions were generated by Union Carbide's decision to consolidate its national technical operations near Albany.
