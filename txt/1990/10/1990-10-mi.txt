Ninth District economic conditions have been showing signs of weakness recently. Labor market conditions have been mixed. Growth in spending on general merchandise has slowed down lately, automobile sales have been sharply lower, and housing activity has declined. Conditions in the construction industry and in manufacturing have been mixed. Resource-related industries have been doing well. Wage and price increases have remained generally moderate.
Wage increases have remained moderate except for technically skilled specialists whose wages have been rising sharply. The main source of pressure on labor costs has continued to be from benefits, mainly health insurance and workers compensation premiums. However, some directors report that they are expecting sharply higher wage increases beginning next year. Price increases, except for fuel costs, have generally been moderate. Trucking companies have begun to impose surcharges to recoup their sharply higher fuel costs. An index of prices received by farmers has declined substantially.
New car sales have been sluggish. Dealers for one manufacturer report that September new car sales were 20 percent lower than a year ago. However, last September's sales were artificially boosted by incentive programs. These dealers expect October sales to be much better when compared with last year. Automobile sales, however, have generally been lower this year than last. Through the first 7 months of the year, Minnesota's new car and truck registrations were down 13.3 percent from last year. This decline has been concentrated in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. Sales in the rest of the state have held up fairly well compared to last year.
Housing starts have declined sharply in Minnesota. The number of new housing permits issued in that state was 25 percent lower this August than last. The decline was primarily concentrated in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area where the number of new housing permits declined by 37.7 percent over the same period. In the first eight months of this year in this area, the number of permits issued has been the lowest since 1982. However, housing sales have been robust in the metropolitan area. Housing activity elsewhere in the district has been moderately good.
Conditions in the district's manufacturing industries have been mixed lately. The computer and electronics industries in the district are reported to be in a recession. Sales of recreational vehicles are reported to be 25 percent lower this year than in 1989 and 40 percent lower than in 1988. However, aircraft industry suppliers report that their sales are 30 percent higher this year than last, and the medical instruments industry is reported to be growing strongly. This industry expects a 10 to 15 percent growth in sales next year from this year's strong levels. Defense industry and ordnance suppliers have recently seen a sharp pickup in orders.
