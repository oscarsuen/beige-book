Purchasing managers' surveys in the District generally showed activity expanding in June. The Detroit survey in June rose 2 points from the previous month to 50.9, marking the first time in fifteen months that the index registered an expansion in activity. Much of the improvement was centered in auto-related production and orders. The Chicago purchasing managers' survey for June continued to show expanding activity, but at a slower pace than in May. According to the survey, production edged down from the previous month, which was its highest level this year. Although orders slowed markedly in June and backlogs declined, the Chicago survey indicated that most purchasing agents expect business activity to improve over the rest of the year.
Steel shipments for the second quarter were about the same as in the second quarter of 1989, according to a major steel producer in the District. Summer bookings have been strong, in part because of increases in auto production. Appliances appear to be booking normally for the summer. Total steel shipments in the third quarter are expected to be ahead of seasonal gains.
Housing sales in the Chicago area dropped in June from year-ago levels, according to an area realtor. Some of the decline was attributed to exceptionally high sales last year. However, June sales were also slightly below the six year average for that month, indicating some softness in the market. High priced homes are having the most difficulty selling, according to an industry analyst. The rate of pricing increases in the Chicago area has slowed significantly since last fall. Price increases since October were reportedly running slightly below the inflation rate, compared to double-digit rates earlier.
Credit standards have changed little since early in the year, according to several respondents, but bank examiners have become increasingly thorough in evaluating loan risk. Highly leveraged borrowing is down sharply and, in many cases, banks have shortened the maturity of loans to limit risk exposure. However, most bankers stated that "quality" loans are having no problems with funding. One District bank reported picking up business from other banks that had backed out of projects in recent months.
