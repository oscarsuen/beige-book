Steel output has held up better than expected. Operating rates of some flat-rolled steel producers have been hovering at about 90% of capacity, and order books at one mill are reported to be full, although lead times are not as extended as last year. Orders and shipments in July are reported to be stronger than usual. Orders for construction steel, however, have been weakening. Some of the unexpected strength in overall steel output has occurred because the volume of imported steel has fallen in response to weak domestic steel prices and strong demand abroad.
Auto output this quarter is expected to be sustained at last quarter's rate, barring a work stoppage in the industry because of labor contract negotiations. The cautious optimism for the third-quarter production outlook apparently is based on strong dealer demand for light trucks during much of the 1990 model year. Auto dealers in the District report a significant slowdown in new car sales in July from June. Dealers are not as optimistic about near-term sales prospects as they were in our previous survey. They note less showroom traffic, a perception that consumers are concerned about a slow-growth economy, and the price increases announced by the Big Three auto producers.
A capital goods producer is slightly more sanguine about over business spending for producers' equipment this half than they were a few months ago, because manufacturing output is better than he expected.
District surveys and respondents suggest cautious optimism that second-half production will be as good as or better than the first half. The latest survey of CPAs in Ohio shows that 87% of the 600 respondents expect that business in Ohio will equal or exceed the first half, which is slightly higher than in the previous survey. The latest survey of purchasing managers in Cleveland shows that 73% of the respondents expect a similar scenario.
