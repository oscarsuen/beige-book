Ninth District economic conditions have been moderately good lately. Labor markets have been strengthening, retail sales have been growing fairly well, and tourist spending has been strong. However, new cars have been selling very slowly, housing activity has been lackluster, and nonresidential construction has been weak. Conditions have been mixed in manufacturing. but resource-related industries have been doing very well.
Wage and price increases have remained at a moderate 3 to 5 percent rate in the district. A manufacturer of wood products in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area reports that wage and benefit packages have been increasing at a rate of around 4 percent. A contractor in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan reports that, in spite of strong demand for workers, wage and benefit packages have been increasing at only a 3.5 percent rate. However, costs in agriculture are reported to be increasing at a more rapid rate. The costs of producing corn and soybeans are reported to be 6 to 10 percent higher than last year, with most of the increase reflecting higher rental rates on land.
Tourism remains the brightest spot in the district's economy. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, tourist spending is said to have doubled over the last two years. In Montana, it has remained strong.
New car sales, however, have continued to be soft in the district. One dealer reports that sales in the first half of 1990 were 25 percent below a year earlier. Still, many dealers report signs of improving sales in late June and early July and are optimistic about sales prospects in the rest of the year. Inventories of cars and trucks are reported to be at satisfactory levels.
Housing activity has shown signs of slowing in the district. The number of new housing permits issued in Minnesota was 7.8 percent lower in May than a year earlier. At the same time, the number issued in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area was 9 percent below a year ago. There have also been reports of a decline in the prices of high-priced homes.
Conditions in the district's manufacturing industries have been mixed. Suppliers to the aircraft industry and manufacturers of capital goods report fairly good business. But the electronics industry and defense suppliers have continued to struggle. A supplier to the residential construction industry says its firm is "in a recession."
