Developments have been mixed to somewhat soft in the Second District economy since the last report. On the positive side, District unemployment rates have remained below the national average. Retailers have had varied sales results. Despite a decided pickup in office leasing activity, vacancy rates in Manhattan have moved somewhat higher and homebuilding activity has weakened in much of the District. Based on a survey of small and medium-sized banks, demand for both residential and commercial real estate loans is weaker than a year ago.
During June, over-the-year changes in sales ranged from -7.3 percent to +7.4 percent. Some New York City retailers with disappointing results expressed concern that the local economy may be in a downturn and were not optimistic about any near-term improvement. One cited the continuing layoffs at banks and brokerage firms, the disarray in the retail industry, and the weak real estate market as major factors in the slowdown.
Sales of home furnishings and men's apparel were most frequently cited as weak, while over-the-year gains in some types of women's apparel were widespread. Inventories remain satisfactory due primarily to careful monitoring. Some stores in bankruptcy or with substantial debt noted an improvement in their level of stocks due to less reluctance on the part of manufacturers to supply them. In Manhattan the space vacated on Fifth Avenue by a recently failed chain has just been leased by the largest department store company in France.
Despite a decided pickup in office leasing activity during recent weeks, in part because of declining rents and other concessions, vacancy rates in both midtown and downtown Manhattan moved somewhat higher primarily as a result of a continuing contraction by financial service firms and the relocation of some companies to other areas. Elsewhere in the District, vacancy rates have recently declined in Fairfield County and have stabilized in Westchester County and northern New Jersey as a result of strong leasing activity and a slowdown in new office completions. Since few new office projects are being proposed given the more than ample supply of space in the District, a shortage of credit seems to be less of a problem in this market than among homebuilders.
The June Rochester purchasing managers' survey described local conditions as stable. With regard to the outlook, 47 percent of respondents expect conditions to improve over the next three months compared with only 9 percent in June 1989. In Buffalo the percentage of purchasing managers reporting a rise in output increased while the percentage of firms with higher new orders showed little change from May.
