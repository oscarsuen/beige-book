Prices of merchandise rose while inventory levels were mostly unchanged over the period. Almost half of the respondents reported that they had raised their prices in the past month, and nearly 60 percent indicated that they had paid higher prices for goods at wholesale.
When asked to indicate the most important problem facing their firms, more than half of the respondents identified poor sales. Poor sales seem to be particularly pronounced in the textile and furniture industries. One textile firm said weak sales had pushed profits down, and another noted that several textile plants had closed this year.
District manufacturers' views of current conditions in the national economy mirrored their own business activity. Almost two-fifths of the respondents said they believed economic activity in the nation had declined compared to a month ago. Looking forward, respondents remained optimistic but were somewhat less so than earlier this year. A majority still expect increases over the next six months in their shipments, new orders, the workweek, and new orders for exports. They look for backlogs of orders to be unchanged, but expect inventories of materials and of finished goods to shrink. Over one-third expect national economic activity to increase in the next six months while 27 percent look for a decline. In our June survey, however, 80 percent expected the nation's economy to turn up in coming months.
Reductions in interest rates were reported by many respondents and most expect further reductions in the weeks ahead. Lower interest rates on loans were reported by 46 percent of the respondents and none reported higher rates. About three-fourths of those surveyed expect the rates they charge on loans to decline in the near future and none look for rate increases.
Preliminary results from a July 1 survey of District agricultural lenders show that over three-fourths of the respondents were actively seeking new farm loans. Four-fifths of the respondents said that the availability of funds was greater than usual at their institutions, but 28 percent characterized loan demand as less than usual compared to eight percent who reported it to be greater than usual.
