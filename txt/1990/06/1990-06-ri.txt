A telephone survey of resort hotels in the District suggested that tourist activity has been mixed so far this spring.

Realtors indicated that home sales in all price ranges during May remained at April levels. Housing sales in the District, although sluggish so far this year, have been above the pace of 1989 and realtors are optimistic that sales activity will pick up In the months ahead. Many potential home buyers, they said, are either waiting for their current homes to sell or for mortgage rates to decline further.
Most home builders contacted said they started fewer homes in May than in April. The new starts were targeted largely for the middle and upper price tiers of the market. May sales of new homes were depressed, the builders noted, and there is now a large inventory of unsold homes. Most builders complained about their difficulties in obtaining credit.
Consumer demand for home equity loans remained strong in May. Over 90 percent of the bankers surveyed reported that the demand for home equity loans either remained at or increased from the April level. Lenders attributed the increase to marketing, seasonal factors and greater consumer awareness of the tax advantages associated with the loans. Over 85 percent of the lenders reported no recent change in the interest rates they charge on home equity and other consumer loans.
