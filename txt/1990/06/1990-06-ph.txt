Economic conditions in the Third District in June varied among major sectors, with most marked by some signs of current or developing softness. Manufacturing activity was close to leveling off after a year-long decline although employment was still being cut. Retail sales were barely up from a year ago, in current dollars, with results hampered by slow sales of summer goods, and auto sales have declined. Bank lending was fairly healthy year-over-year, but there were indications that growth was ebbing. Real estate activity, both residential and commercial, was sluggish, and construction, especially of offices, was dropping.
The outlook in the Third District business community is subdued. Manufacturers generally foresee a modest increase in production in the second half of the year, but they do not expect to step up hiring. Retailers are being cautious in their sales forecasts for the balance of the year, and they said planning is complicated by continued uncertainty with respect to industry restructuring. Bankers expect loan growth to continue to slacken as a result of weakening loan demand and tightening of credit standards.
Overall, Third District manufacturers noted a steady rate of new orders, a marginal pickup in shipments, and a drop in order backlogs. Although most of the firms surveyed were maintaining steady employment levels and working hours, on net, they continued to make fractional cuts in personnel and hours. Industrial prices in the region were steady, with three-fourths of the companies polled holding prices of their products steady and nearly nine-out-of-ten reporting stable input costs.
Looking ahead, Third District manufacturers generally foresee improvement in the second half of the year. On balance, they expect a pickup in orders and they plan to boost shipments accordingly, without a buildup in order backlogs. Although they expect to step up the pace of production, area firms are planning to hold the line on working hours and make some further cuts in payrolls by the end of the year.
Third District merchants were growing more cautious in their outlook for the rest of the year. Several said they have been trimming sales forecasts since early spring and they saw no signs of a pickup for the summer or fall. Some noted that discounting appeared to be spreading even to stores that traditionally have been able to avoid recourse to price reductions to spur sales. Merchants said that with excess capacity in retailing and little evidence of resurgent economic growth, prospects for the industry will not brighten soon.
Commercial and residential construction continued to decline in June as office vacancies increased and credit available to developers shrunk. Suburban office and speculative housing construction were relatively weakest, while industrial construction, which is not typically speculative, and pre-sold residential building retained some health.
