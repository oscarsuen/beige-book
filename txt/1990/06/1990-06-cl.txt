Respondents report that manufacturing output rose in May and expect that second quarter growth in output, particularly in autos, will be stronger than in the first quarter. Higher auto output should add between 0.5 and 1.0 percentage point to the real GNP growth rate this quarter.
The problem in real estate appears to be in multifamily housing and in commercial buildings, where developers and builders complain that it is "hard to find lenders." Lenders, for their part, emphasize prudence in their exposure to this sector of the economy. Small builders, especially of single-family units, report funds are still ample, although FIRREA legislation has forced a search for credit away from traditional lenders, generally thrifts. According to one report, the major complaint among single-family builders is a sluggish demand for houses rather than unavailability of credit.
At present, there is little to indicate that credit conditions have tightened in other parts of the regional economy. Bankers report that recent slowing in growth of consumer credit is due to softening demand rather than to tightened supply of credit. A few lenders noted that consumer spending could be dampened if lines of credit based on equity in homes are reduced.
