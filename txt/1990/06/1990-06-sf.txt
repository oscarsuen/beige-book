In contrast, some other products are seeing flat or lower prices. Prices for lumber and wood chips have fallen sharply in recent months, squeezing profits as log prices remain high. A car dealer reports that there is downward pressure on the prices of new cars. Many clothing retailers reportedly believe that the recent CPI increase in women's apparel prices is spurious, since competition in the industry makes it unlikely that higher prices can be maintained.
Reports of flattening or declining activity continue to he concentrated in the defense and technology sectors. Several defense firms in the West have announced layoffs in recent weeks, and one large firm also has announced plans to move some of its operations from southern California to Georgia. The strength of commercial aviation, as well as possible increases in NASA funding, are the main bright spots for these firms. Overall conditions in technology-related sectors are relatively flat at present, but with wide variations by company and product line. One company supplying the computer industry reports very slow sales, but some firms in various segments of the electronics, computer, and software industries are doing very well.
Conditions in the forest products industries continue to deteriorate. More stringent restrictions on logging federal land have reduced the supply of logs and increased their price. At the same time, reduced home-building activity nationwide has weakened the price for finished lumber. The resulting profit squeeze has led several mills to lay off workers or close down entirely.
