Ninth District economic conditions have been moderately good lately, though there have been some signs of softening. Employment growth has been low, retail sales growth has fallen off, and new cars have been selling very slowly. However, some types of manufacturing have shown some strength, and conditions in resource-related industries have been excellent.
Wage and price increases have remained moderate in the district. Employers continue to report that health care costs have been rising rapidly. Some employers in Minnesota report that high worker compensation insurance premiums have induced them to self-insure. A Bank director reports that, in Minnesota's manufacturing industry, raw material costs have remained level while finished good prices have stabilized after rising fairly rapidly earlier in the year.
New car sales have continued to be very soft in the district, particularly compared to last year. However, some dealers point out that sales last May were unusually high because manufacturers offered rebates on their cars. Used car sales, which were strong earlier in the year, also show signs or slowing.
Housing sales have generally been strong in the district, but new housing construction has been low. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area of Minnesota, housing sales were higher in April than in any month in the last two years and May sales were 9 percent higher than in May 1989. In all of Minnesota, the number of new housing permits issued was 20 percent lower this March than last. Much of this decline is concentrated in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where the number of new permits declined 34 percent.
Cool weather and rain haven't dampened the spirits of travelers in the district. Michigan's Upper Peninsula and Wisconsin's Arrowhead region are expecting a good summer. The number of people crossing the Mackinac Bridge into the Upper Peninsula is at a record high. Retailers in the area report strong sales to Canadian tourists. In Minnesota, the fishing season got off to a good start, and throughout the district, campgrounds are filled on weekends. North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana expect some decline in tourist spending from last year because 1989 was their centennial year. Montana forests are green again, with few marks left of the fire at Yellowstone two years ago. Tourist activity in Montana is expected to be strong this summer.
Nonresidential construction in the Twin Cities area has been relatively weak. The dollar volume of contracts for future nonresidential construction in April was unchanged from a year ago. Vacancy rates for office space in this area are expected to rise sharply with the completion of several major projects.
