Most district savings and loans report deposit outflows over both the last month and the last year. Deposits are expected to stabilize soon. Demand for mortgage funds remains weak, and most respondents expect little improvement in upcoming months. Mortgage rates have been constant or up slightly at most institutions. There was no consensus on the future direction of mortgage ratesâ€”some respondents expect rates to rise while others expect rates to fall.
Changes in loan-deposit ratios and in deposit activity were mixed at district banks. IRA and Keogh accounts were generally up, while MMDAs were generally down.
The district's winter wheat crop is generally in good condition, although continued wet weather has contributed to disease problems in some areas and could delay the wheat harvest. The wheat harvest has begun in Oklahoma end will progress north across the district through mid-July. Expected yields range from average to well above average, with record yields likely in much of Kansas.
Improved pasture conditions, due to the plentiful rains, ensure an adequate feed supply for cattle herds. Although plentiful forage supplies encourage herd expansion, feeder cattle prices remain exceptionally strong. As a result, herd expansion is occurring at a slow pace.
