Residential construction in the District is following a pattern similar to the nonresidential sector. Contracts for housing construction were up 10 percent an the District, compared to an 8 percent decline nationally for the first four months of 1990. However, the District dropped 3 percent in April from year-ago levels, with Illinois accounting for the bulk of the decline. A Chicago-area realtor reports that local residential sales were up in April, May, and early June over a year ago, after being flat for several months. Housing prices are edging up, but have slowed sharply from the year-ago pace as houses take longer to sell. Some large banks in early June have dropped their mortgage rates on average about a half a point to slightly below 10 percent.
Sales of apparel goods continued to be weak in early June. Apparel sales, according to one analyst, have been hurt by unseasonably cold weather and consumer resistance to higher prices. Higher prices were attributed in part to a slackening of competitive pressures after several retail chains filed for bankruptcy. Most of the sales decline in apparel is concentrated in women's apparel, with men's and children's apparel showing modest strength.
Capital-goods producers generally report mixed activity, following the overall pattern of manufacturing. A producer of heavy equipment states that District plants that make highway construction and mining equipment are doing very well, but plants that produce heavy equipment tied to building construction are slowing down. A producer of agricultural equipment reports continued sales strength especially for combines and four-wheel drive tractors. However, agricultural equipment sales are expected to begin slowing by the end of the year, as replacement demand softens. Sales of light industrial equipment, which follows the housing industry closely, are down 10 percent from a year ago. A producer of food processing and material handling equipment notes some softening in orders from very high levels. A materials supplier cites strength in the demand for pumps and compressors, coming in part from new chemical plants, and for plastics-making equipment, coming in part from overseas. An economist for a large electronics producer reports that orders for communications equipment have returned to double-digit growth rates and shipments are expected to reach double-digit rates by the end of the year. Orders for electronic components used in computers are still relatively weak, but are beginning to show some improvement.
