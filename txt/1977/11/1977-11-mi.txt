While still fairly strong, economic activity here shows some signs of slowing. Consumers are still spending well in areas not hurt by the iron ore strike or agriculture's problems. And farmers' income outlook has actually improved somewhat recently. But some directors are not concerned about excessive business inventories and an apparent slowdown in homebuilding.
Directors see these developments—especially the subsidies—as   helping rural banks' current liquidity problems. Because farmers   have so far had little money to repay loans or save, rural bank   liquidity is tighter than usual. In our October survey of rural   bankers, 35 percent called their loan-to-deposit ratio "high," more   than the 29 percent in July. The share with 70 percent or more of   their deposits loaned out increased from 36 to 42 percent. And in   October a quarter of the bankers were referring more than the usual   number of loans to nonbank credit agencies.
Although not yet indicating a widespread sales slowdown, directors   report some unexpected business inventory buildup. Directors say the   demand for pulp and paper in eastern Montana has weakened enough to   put inventories 25 percent above a year ago. And excess copper   inventories are depressing activity in Upper Michigan. Several other   directors report inventories somewhat high but not yet a problem.   One says customers of his major manufacturing firm are cutting   orders at the slightest sign of weaker sales.
Housing activity appears to be slowing here too. Total residential   building permits in the district are still far above last year and   the 1972 record level. And directors see strong homebuilding in   Montana, South Dakota, southwestern Wisconsin, and Minneapolis-St.   Paul. But Minneapolis-St. Paul realtors say the demand for housing   there has weakened recently. And directors note less building in   North Dakota, parts of Upper Michigan, and central Minnesota.
Some directors think homebuilding will slow further because less   mortgage money will be available. Though right now funds are still   generally adequate throughout the district, directors in Montana and   South Dakota are concerned about high short-term interest rates   drying up funds in their states. A Minnesota director associated   with the housing industry actually expects disintermediation to cut   this region's residential construction 15 percent next year.
