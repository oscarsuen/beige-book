While still fairly strong, economic activity here shows some signs of slowing. Consumers are still spending well in areas not hurt by the iron ore strike or agriculture's problems. And farmers' income outlook has actually improved somewhat recently. But some directors are not concerned about excessive business inventories and an apparent slowdown in homebuilding.
The district's strength and its two major weaknesses are still   reflected in reports about consumer spending. Overall, retail sales   have been very good and are expected to remain so through the   holiday season. But the three-month-old iron ore workers' strike is   depressing income and spending in northeastern Minnesota and the   Upper Peninsula of Michigan. People in areas dependent on   agriculture have not had much to spend either: directors from North   and South Dakota say farm-related retail sales there have been only   fair or "spotty," and about half of the rural bankers responding to   our October survey of ag credit conditions said farmers were   spending less than last year.
Spending in rural areas may increase somewhat because farmers'   income prospects improved recently. Rain and insects did not hurt   crops as much as expected so farmers have more to sell than they   thought. They are getting more for their crops too: because of   rumors of better demand here and abroad, grain prices have stopped   falling and some have actually turned up. Further price improvement   is likely since the Russians' poorer-than-expected wheat harvest has   been officially confirmed. More money will also be available from   the government; the new farm bill's target price on wheat could   bring district farmers as much as $300-350 million in subsidies this   December. Including government payments, farm receipts from crops   this year are now expected to at least match last year's level.
Directors see these developments—especially the subsidies—as   helping rural banks' current liquidity problems. Because farmers   have so far had little money to repay loans or save, rural bank   liquidity is tighter than usual. In our October survey of rural   bankers, 35 percent called their loan-to-deposit ratio "high," more   than the 29 percent in July. The share with 70 percent or more of   their deposits loaned out increased from 36 to 42 percent. And in   October a quarter of the bankers were referring more than the usual   number of loans to nonbank credit agencies.
The weak ag sector looks a little better this month, but some   directors see signs of slowing in the district's relatively strong   business activity.
Although not yet indicating a widespread sales slowdown, directors   report some unexpected business inventory buildup. Directors say the   demand for pulp and paper in eastern Montana has weakened enough to   put inventories 25 percent above a year ago. And excess copper   inventories are depressing activity in Upper Michigan. Several other   directors report inventories somewhat high but not yet a problem.   One says customers of his major manufacturing firm are cutting   orders at the slightest sign of weaker sales.
Housing activity appears to be slowing here too. Total residential   building permits in the district are still far above last year and   the 1972 record level. And directors see strong homebuilding in   Montana, South Dakota, southwestern Wisconsin, and Minneapolis-St.   Paul. But Minneapolis-St. Paul realtors say the demand for housing   there has weakened recently. And directors note less building in   North Dakota, parts of Upper Michigan, and central Minnesota.
Some directors think homebuilding will slow further because less   mortgage money will be available. Though right now funds are still   generally adequate throughout the district, directors in Montana and   South Dakota are concerned about high short-term interest rates   drying up funds in their states. A Minnesota director associated   with the housing industry actually expects disintermediation to cut   this region's residential construction 15 percent next year.
