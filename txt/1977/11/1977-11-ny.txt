Activity in the Second District continues to be mixed and lagging behind that of the rest of the nation, according to recent comments of directors and other business leaders. On the national outlook, respondents were generally encouraged by prospects of continued economic expansion, although many appeared concerned that the uncertainties of prospective tax and energy legislation will inhibit capital spending. Within the district, retail activity posted a moderate gain in October, but inventory levels remained on the high side. Harvest losses caused by heavy rains in the Western region of the district are expected to exceed $150 million. Containerized port activity remains at a standstill as the dock strike enters its second month.
Department store sales in October apparently met merchants'   expectations. Several leading retailers reported that sales were   very strong during the first half of the month but subsequently   waned. For the most part, retailing executives attributed the   slackening in activity to unseasonably warm weather, which curtailed   purchases of outerwear. One leading merchant suggested that part of   the slowdown could be the lack of a spillover of pre-Election Day   sales activity into October. Several respondents indicated that   sales gains lagged the rest of the nation. Despite the softening,   the department store executives looked to the approaching Christmas   season with "cautious optimism."
Outside of department stores, consumer spending on new cars appeared   more robust, although here too the pace appeared to lag the nation.   A director of a major automobile finance company held a sanguine   assessment of automobile sales, professing no concern over consumer   indebtedness or delinquency rates. Several major auto dealers   reported that sales in October were on target but lagging national   sales. The higher prices of new models apparently met with little   sales resistance.
Although some inventory imbalances were reported, they did not   appear to be widespread nor unduly burdensome. In the retail sector,   the slowdown in sales did apparently lead to some buildup in   inventories. One retailing chain executive attributed his firm' s   increase in stocks to over-ordering by store managers. None of the   retailers contacted felt their stocks to be seriously out of line   with plans, especially in view of the approaching Christmas season.   In the industrial sector, a chemical executive expected the   industry's inventory excesses to be worked off by the end of the   year. For the most part, respondents felt that businesses' tight   inventory policies prevented any serious or widespread involuntary   accumulation.
Pervasive uncertainty over government policies was frequently blamed   for inhibiting capital spending by business. Several directors   reported that firms were awaiting clarification of the outlook on   tax legislation before framing their capital spending plans. More   generally, uncertainty surrounding a broad range of government   policies was cited by the chairman of a major New York City bank.   One director voiced apprehension over energy and environmental   policies as retarding plant and equipment outlays. The president of   a major chemical firm mentioned the uncertainty associated with the   proposed social security legislation. The president of a major New   Jersey bank felt that local business in his area seemed to be more   caught up with local environmental and tax issues than with national   policies. In a similar vein, the Buffalo directors expressed concern   over the high tax burdens in New York State that tend to limit   spending on capital improvements of existing plants. On a positive   note, one Buffalo director reported some acceleration in capital   spending plans among small- to medium-sized firms due to special tax   incentives offered by the State for job-creating capital infusions.
There is a good deal of concern over the farm crop in central and   western New York State. Heavy rain from the middle of September   through October seriously damaged the crops and left the ground too   wet to harvest surviving crops by the customary mechanical means.   Dairy farmers also are suffering as they are unable to harvest the   feed for their herds. Crop damage in the thirty-five upstate   counties is expected to exceed $150 million.
Another negative factor weighing on the regional economy is the   limited dock strike, which appears to be having an increasing impact   as it enters its second month. According to an executive of a   leading maritime firm, there are currently 16 to 20 fully loaded   ships tied up in the Port of New York. There appears little hope for   an immediate settlement though there are some indications that one   many be reached before Thanksgiving. The lengthy strike is expected   to produce serious difficulties for retailers who offer significant   quantities of imported merchandise for Christmas sale and could   spark some upward price pressures. The continuation of the strike   also has serious repercussions on Puerto Rico because of the  commonwealth's heavy reliance on imported goods.
