Economic conditions are generally good in the Tenth District, except in agriculture, and even there some improvement is observed. Directors and business economists believe the expansion will continue at a slow-to-moderate rate, held back largely by business reluctance to invest when there is so much uncertainty. A combination of price increases and government payments has increased cash flow to farmers, although the squeeze continues. Loan demand is up sharply in most banks, and expected to rise more rapidly than deposits in the month ahead.
According to Directors contacted, the major stumbling block to   business fixed investment continues to be uncertainty about Federal   Government policies and regulations. This is also the refrain of   economists employed by businesses in the District. For the most   part, Directors and business economists do not believe that   developments in recent weeks have jeopardized the outlook for   moderately slow growth in the economy in the year ahead. Of those   who offered comments on the rise in short-term interest rates, all   but one economist felt the increases were necessary to fight   inflation.
With only a couple of exceptions, businesses intend to go through   with the purchases of plant and equipment that they had planned   earlier. General business conditions are observed to be good   throughout the District, except in areas especially dependent upon   sales to grain farmers. "They aren't buying anything," says one   Director, who also notes, "This credit thing isn't getting any   better out here (Kansas). The banks say they have gone as far as   they can go, and some have told the farmers to consider selling some   land."
Some signs of an easing in Tenth District farmers' cash flow   problems are beginning to be observed. For the first 7 months of   1977, cash receipts from farm marketings increased 1.5 per cent over   year-earlier levels for District farmers. Wheat and corn prices have   slowly increased above summer lows, although they are still quite   depressed. Additionally, in the District states, 222.4 million   bushels of the 1977 wheat crop have already been placed under   Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) loans. In most instances, the net   proceeds to farmers of these loans have exceeded the market price of   the wheat. Substantial quantities of 1977 corn are also expected to   go under CCC loans, again with net loan proceeds for many of the   loans likely to exceed cash corn prices. Of the $1.2 billion in   deficiency payments the Nation's wheat farmers will receive late   this year under the target-price program, an estimated $501 million   (42 per cent of the total) will be paid to wheat farmers in the   Tenth District states. Payments will average almost $19 for each   acre of wheat harvested in these states during 1977. Finally, fat   cattle and feeder cattle prices are presently almost 13 per cent   above year-earlier levels, while hog prices are currently 33 per   cent above year-earlier levels. Thus, although the farm-price   squeeze continues, District farmers are experiencing some modest   improvement in cash flow.
The monthly survey of Tenth District bankers indicates that, for   most respondents, loan demand is up sharply. Strength of the   individual bank's loan portfolio reflects the economic diversity of   the District. Construction loans for residential building,   especially one-family homes, are reported strong in the Denver and   Lincoln areas, while energy-related loan demand is reported strong   in Oklahoma and in Denver. Other respondents indicate that inventory   loans and correspondent bank loans are contributory factors in the   strength of loan demand.
Most respondents dealing in agricultural loans say that, in general,   new agricultural loans are simply extensions of old loans. One   Denver banker feels that some of these loans have become illiquid,   especially in over-lines from rural banks to large banks. One   respondent mentions that the agricultural loan market was very tight   in September, but has since eased due to the harvest being near   completion and to the sale of grain inventories.
A majority of respondents expect loan demand to increase more   rapidly than usual during the next month, although none expect   strong agricultural loan demand. The expectation of strong loan   demand in the future is reflected by the raising of prime rates to 7   3/4 per cent, an action taken by all but one banker surveyed. Almost   all bankers expect future loan demand to outstrip deposit inflows,   requiring them to use CD's as well as nondeposit sources of funds   such as Fed funds.
Most bankers report that time and savings inflows had slowed or   stopped in October. Only a very few report any evidence of   disintermediation.
