Economic activity in the Eighth Federal Reserve District continues upward, although the rate of increase has slowed from the rapid advances early this year. Some gains in consumer spending have occurred since last summer. Manufacturing activity continues at a high rate, but with only modest gains in recent weeks. Businessmen are generally satisfied with the current level of inventories. In some cases inventories have been increased to reflect anticipated increases in sales, but reports indicate that cautious inventory policies are being followed. In the financial sector, demand has been brisk for all types of loans. Crop yields in the District are generally excellent and, on the whole, harvesting has proceeded ahead of schedule.
Consumer spending continues to increase relative to year ago levels.   Gains in sales since the summer months have been primarily in   softgood items, but big-ticket items, such as furniture, appliances,   home improvement items, and automobiles, have continued to sell at   the relatively high midsummner rates. Strong Christmas holiday sales   are anticipated by department store representatives, and gains over   a year ago are expected to be at least as large as those posted in   recent months.
Inventories at both the retail and manufacturing levels are reported   to be at a desirable level, given current sales expectations.   Retailers note inventories are sufficient to accommodate some   increases in sales, but they believe overstocking for the Christmas   season has been avoided. A manufacturing representative of a capital   goods firm noted that inventories have been built up for certain   items in anticipation of future increases in sales. While these   inventories are now considered to be at a healthy level, it was   noted that a decline in sales from expected levels could   substantially alter this appraisal. One clothing manufacturer   reported a greater than preferred level of finished goods at the   manufacturing level, but this situation was improving rather than   worsening. In home construction, inventories of unsold homes are   quite low and some backlogs of buyers still exist.
A recent slowing in savings inflows has been detected by financial   institutions. Savings and loan association representatives report   that recent slower gains in savings deposits may be the result of   rising market rates relative to rates offered by financial   intermediaries. Commercial banks have experienced increases in total   savings deposits, but most of the increases were in higher-yielding   time deposits and large certificates of deposits.
Demand remains strong for most types of loans. Home mortgage loan   demand is still quite strong for this time of year. Earlier this   year mortgage lenders had difficulties in keeping up with the   incoming applications for loans, but the rush has subsided. Instead,   lenders are now actively seeking loans. Business loans at larger   commercial banks have picked up after several months of   sluggishness. A representative of a large commercial bank noted that   demand for loans by large corporations was greater than it had been   for some time. Also, further gains in consumer, real estate, and   agricultural loans were registered in recent weeks.
Manufacturing activity continues at a high level. Strength emanating   from the housing sector is noted by several manufacturers. A major   appliance manufacturer, for example, noted that contract sales to   the housing industry have continued brisk, and that appliance sales   at the retail level have held up better than anticipated. Suppliers   of building materials, such as heating equipment and connector   plates, report sales on a seasonally adjusted basis are still quite   vigorous. A representative of a capital goods firm pointed to   substantial increases in orders from a year ago, and further gains   are anticipated next year. On the other hand, an apparel   manufacturer, serving mostly rural areas, reports little change in   sales in recent months as a result of lower farm incomes. Also,   despite generally good sales of chemicals, sales of some fibers and   plastics have been less than expected, partly reflecting sluggish   export markets.
Crop yields are reported to be excellent and harvesting of crops has   continued at a generally satisfactory pace in the District. Cotton   picking is well ahead of normal and rice harvesting is virtually   complete. On the other hand, soybean harvesting has been held up by   rainy weather and in some areas of the District fall planting of   wheat has been halted. Harvesting of some crops is not likely to be   resumed until freezes permit farm equipment to be moved into the   fields.
