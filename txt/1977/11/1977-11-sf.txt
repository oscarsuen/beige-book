The Western economy is still growing, but with a few weak spots. Retail sales are mixed—strong in some places, sluggish in others. Inventories are generally at desired levels. The industrial picture is also mixed—many industries growing nicely but problems in pulp and paper, aerospace and steel. The current kingpin of the Western economy is construction, where single family building continues strong, but multiple unit and commercial appear even stronger. Demand continues strong for both construction and mortgage lending. While there is concern about disintermediation, little has been observed.
Retail sales appear uneven in the West. Some areas report strong   sales, particularly in small cars, while others report sluggish   sales. Third quarter retail sales were up 14.5 percent in Utah and   14.0 percent in Idaho over a year ago. Food sales in Seattle are a   bit weak, due partly to the fact that the Boeing strike involves   some 2 1/2 percent of the total Seattle work force. Also, a national   clothing manufacturer located in the district reports mediocre   sales. Inventories appear to be generally at desired levels.
The Western industrial picture is mixed. The forest products   industry is generally in good health, except for the pulp and paper   portion which was declared by one director to be a "disaster area." Aluminum orders have leveled off temporarily, but there is said to   be fundamental growth in the demand for aluminum from the food and   transportation sectors, so that output next year is expected to   increase beyond a rather good 1977. Aerospace is hampered by strikes   at both Boeing and Lockheed. Steel production in Oregon is said to   be depressed by foreign imports, but overall, Oregon manufacturing   continues strong as indicated in the rising employment figures. Two   new food export ventures were noted in the Pacific Northwest. One is   an operation which has begun to ship a planeload of live beef to   Japan each week and the other is a project by a large Seattle food   distributor to fly fresh meat and produce to a new supermarket in   the Middle East.
Directors from Utah and Idaho claim not to be experiencing a pause   in their economies. Most firms are said to be far out-stripping   their level of output of the previous year. Significant employment   gains in construction, mining and manufacturing are cited for Utah.
Construction appears to be the sector of strength in the Western   economy. While average unemployment rates remain high, there is   virtually no unemployment in construction. Some areas are actually   reporting shortages of such skilled workers as electricians,   carpenters and plumbers. However, there have been two shifts taking   place, one is the diffusion of the construction boom from California   to other Western states and the other is a shift from single family   units to multiple units and non-residential construction.
Southern California reports an end to the lotteries and overnight   sellouts of subdivisions, and developers are becoming a bit more   cautious by putting up smaller blocks of houses at a time. Homes are   remaining on the market longer and there is more price bargaining.   While the level of single family construction continues high, the   real growth in Southern California has been in commercial and   industrial construction, which for the first 9 months of this year   was up 110 percent over the same period last year. Even this rapid   growth has apparently not kept pace with demand, for a shortage of   prime, new office space is said to be developing. Construction of   multiple family units is experiencing growth through California—100,400 multiple unit permits were taken out in September, the   largest number since February.
In Utah, 1977 home building is estimated to be up 47 percent over   last year. There, as in several other areas, shortages of such   building materials as insulation, cement and sheetrock have been   reported. In Oregon, residential construction continues strong and   the previously sluggish non-residential sector took off in August at   a level 300 percent higher than a year ago. Portland, in particular,   is said to have experienced more rapid expansion of commercial   construction in the past three months than ever before in history.   One observer listed over $300 million worth of hotel, office and   hospital projects currently underway in the Portland area.
Consistent with the strong pace of construction and real estate   sales, the demand for both mortgage and construction is described as "high," "brisk" and "strong" all over the district, though some   areas report a leveling off in demand. Reports from Southern   California, in particular, note that while mortgage demand is still   strong, it is less than in the first half of the year when real   estate speculation was at its peak. It is explained that most of the   pent-up demand for homes has run its course and consumers have   become slightly more cautious about incurring additional debt.
A number of directors addressed the question of disintermediation,   but only one felt he had observed any signs of the phenomenon having   actually begun. While banks in smaller towns felt there would be no   problem until 90-day Treasury bill rates hit 7 1/2 to 8 percent,   large California banks felt 6 1/2 percent would be enough to trigger   a mild degree of disintermediation. Still, even one of these larger   bankers observed that a prolonged or extensive shortage of mortgage   credit similar to 1969 and 1974 is not expected because financial   institutions are more liquid now and interest rates are not expected   to reach double-digit levels.
