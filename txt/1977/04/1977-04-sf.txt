The recovery appears to be continuing in the Twelfth District, although capital investment is increasing in only a few industries. Retail sales as well as sales of a number of manufactured goods are strong and employment is generally increasing. Low crop prices and drought-induced cost increases have hurt both farm income and agricultural employment. Housing demand and construction activity in general are very strong and a few lending institutions have raised their mortgage rates by 1/4 of a percent.
Retail sales are reported strong in many areas and at least two   major shopping centers are under construction. Retail business is   reported to be an important source of commercial loan demand.
Sales of a number of manufactured products are also reported strong.   Lumber sales are rising due to the housing boom. A major aerospace   firm in the Pacific Northwest is experiencing brisk sales of   commercial aircraft and expects to expand employment by about 10   percent during the year. To increase mileage ratings, the auto   industry is switching from steel to lighterweight aluminum to the   delight of Western aluminum fabricators who are currently operating   at full capacity. Some primary aluminum capacity in the Pacific   Northwest has been shut down due to drought-related curtailments in   hydroelectric power. There is some fear of severe aluminum shortages   next year. Mineral sales in Utah are good, with mineral production   having exceeded a record $1 billion last year.
Mild weather has stimulated tourism in Washington, but has severely   hurt the ski industry in most Western states. California's ski   resorts however, were aided by March snow which brought business   almost back to normal.
There are very few bright spots in Western agriculture. Despite some   rainfall in all states in March, reservoir levels remain very low   causing severe cutbacks in irrigation deliveries, amounting to as   much as 60 to 75 percent in California and 94 percent in one portion   of Washington. There is great concern over the survival of vines and   fruit trees in Washington's Yakima Valley. It is expected that   ranchers in Utah will bring sheep and cattle to market in large   numbers as range conditions grow worse. And on top of the drought   problems, it is reported that the prices of a number of farm   products (wheat, corn, rice, sugar beets, potatoes and cattle) are   currently below the cost of production. On the retail food scene,   there appears to be another supermarket price war taking shape in   the Los Angeles area.
Housing demand and overall construction activity are reported strong   throughout the district. Mild weather has allowed construction   activity to exceed normal seasonal levels, and construction   employment is reported to be increasing. The housing market is still   exceptionally strong, with used houses selling within a few days of   being put on the market, and housing prices increasing 75 percent   over the past year in some parts of Southern California. A major   Indian Reservation in Oregon reports very active housing demand and   construction activity. Activity is not confined to the residential   market. Demand for commercial and industrial property is also   strong. In Southern California, $75,000/acre is now considered   inexpensive for industrial land.
Employment is on the increase in most parts of the District,   especially in construction, wood and paper products, aerospace, and   aluminum. Partially offsetting has been a general decline in   agricultural employment. For example, the agricultural work force   declined by 5,600 during January in Kern County, California alone. A   large clothing manufacturer in Oregon was forced to layoff a large   number of workers when sales of its summer clothing line failed to   materialize. But there appears to be a broad upward movement in   Western employment.
Banks report that business loan demand is increasing after a period   of remaining flat demand during the first quarter, but they expect   even greater strength in the third and fourth quarters. Mortgage,   construction and consumer loans are reported strong, but business   loans are generally static and agricultural lending is generally   weak. Still, a few areas are facing strong business loan demand. One   banker from Southern California claims no need to even seek   borrowers and a northern Washington banker anticipates a shortage of   loanable funds before year-end. The frenzied demand for housing has   driven mortgage rates up by 1/4 of a percent in parts of Southern   California and Utah.
