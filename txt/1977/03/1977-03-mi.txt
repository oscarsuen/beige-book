Concern continues to be expressed about agricultural conditions in     the Ninth District, but indications are that nonagricultural     business is expanding at a fairly strong pace. January and     February's cold weather did not have a significant effect on     production in this area. In fact, district manufacturing activity is     expanding and further increases are anticipated. So far this year,     consumer spending in the district has been quite good, and     residential building is up in the major urban centers.     Nonresidential building, on the other hand, is somewhat weaker.
Farm-related economic activity continues to reflect anxiety about     this year's moisture conditions and about low agricultural prices.     In those areas dependent primarily upon agriculture, consumer     spending is down and farmers are hesitant to make either short- or     long-term commitments. Although loan losses have not yet been a     problem, rural banks have had to refinance or extend loans. North     Dakota bankers are currently encouraging farmers to sell their wheat     in order to reduce their debt. A number of directors are concerned     that the drought could force some farm operators out of business     this year. Profitability in the livestock industry continues to be     marginal. Two directors report that the situation was aggravated by     January and February's cold weather which accelerated feeding rates     and added further to production costs.
In contrast, the Ninth District's nonagricultural sectors have been     fairly strong so far this year, and general economic activity has     not been disrupted by fuel shortages. Results of our latest     quarterly Industrial Expectations Survey, taken in early February,     indicate that fourth-quarter district manufacturing sales were up 18     percent from a year before. Furthermore, respondents expect their     sales to exceed year-earlier levels in 1977's first, second, and     third quarters by 15, 14, and 15 percent, respectively.
Most of the current strength in district manufacturing sales can be     attributed to sales of durable goods, which were up in the fourth     quarter 23 percent from a year earlier and are expected to advance     year over year around 18 to 21 percent during the first nine months     of 1977. Nondurable goods sales in the fourth quarter advanced 11     percent over a year ago, and only moderate sales gains are foreseen     for the first three quarters of this year.
Manufacturers' evaluations of current inventories and plant     capacities have not changed appreciably since the previous survey.     They remain basically content with inventory levels and existing     plant and equipment in view of expected sales.
Consumer spending in those areas not entirely dependent on     agriculture has been fairly good. A major retailer in the     Minneapolis-St. Paul area indicates that January and February sales     were quite strong and looks for business to continue improving.     Several of this Bank's directors report that consumer spending has     been satisfactory in their areas so far this year. On the other     hand, a large retailer with headquarters in the Twin Cities, reports     that sales so far this year "haven't been really great" and doesn't     anticipate a big spending surge in the immediate future. One     retailer believes that high fuel bills probably curbed some consumer     spending but looks for tax rebates and refunds to help bolster     consumer outlays in the second quarter.
A healthy amount of expansion in district residential construction     is expected for 1977, but it probably won't be as rapid as last     year. One director states that low homeowner vacancy rates should     stimulate single-family construction in the district. Furthermore,     he reports that low apartment vacancy rates point toward a pickup in     multifamily construction. However, a Minneapolis-St. Paul area     banker does not currently foresee any sizable pickup in apartment     building. There is concern in eastern Montana that restrictions on     natural gas hookups could restrain residential construction there.
Nonresidential construction during 1977 is not expected to be as     strong as residential construction in the district, but it is     anticipated to be stronger than nationally. A number of major     energy-development projects are under way, such as coal mining and     coal gasification in western North Dakota.
