The mood of the Twelfth District could be characterized by a     drought-induced uncertainty in agriculture, aluminum, timber, skiing     and energy, tempered by a general optimism that the housing boom     will continue at least through midyear. Timber harvest has been     excellent though there are fears of forest closure due to fire     hazard. Hydro electric power to aluminum producers and irrigation     water to farmers have both been cut back and are causing declines in     production. Little or no snow has caused a substantial decline in     ski resort activity. Low vacancy rates and a vigorous construction     sector characterize most Western states.
To date, timber harvest has actually been aided by the dry winter,     though there is concern that the extreme dryness will create such     fire hazards that logging operations will be curtailed come summer.     Northwest aluminum production has already been cut back 12 percent     with 500 people laid off due to a cutback in power deliveries by the     Bonneville Power Authority. By June, a further decline to 75 percent     of normal production is anticipated. Despite recent snow, ski     resorts in several western states remain in a depressed condition—$20 million in losses and 2,300 people laid off in Utah's skiing     industry alone. Assuming precipitation continues at a quarter of     normal, the Oregon Employment Division predicts that another 6,000     to 9,000 persons will lose their jobs.
The water situation is so uncertain in agriculture that farm     equipment sales are at a standstill in Washington and in parts of     Oregon and California. To date, loss estimates of Oregon's winter     wheat range from 25 to 50 percent and gross farm income is expected     to drop by 12 percent for the year by one banker's estimates. In     Idaho, both sugar beet and winter wheat production are expected to     be down significantly, though potatoes in the Snake River Basin     should have ample water. Fruit growers in Washington's Yakima Valley     are worried about the survival of their trees, since some expect     irrigation deliveries to be only 6 percent of normal. There are     reports of agricultural unemployment in several areas with serious     irrigation cutbacks. In California's San Joaquin Valley, some     observers expect acreage to be cut by 25 to 35 percent, with     production costs up on the remaining land due to increased pumping     costs. Oregon has resorted to cloud seeding and Idaho has raised     legal questions about whether Oregon may be stealing rain that would     have fallen on Idaho.
Weather has had a strong impact on western energy. Record declines     in western stream flow has cut down the hydroelectric output of most     western states. Last year at this time Oregon was sending California     surplus hydroelectricity at a rate equivalent to 300,000 barrels of     oil a day. This year, there is none to spare as the northwest has     had to cut back its power deliveries to its own people: power supply     to the energy-intensive aluminum industry was cut by 25 percent.     Union, Standard and Gulf Oil have each purchased land in     anticipation of the Alaskan pipeline's completion in June, possibly     for refineries though construction has not yet commenced. Utah, in     response to increased demand for coal, raised its coal output to a     record 7.5 million tons last year.
Construction activity continues strong in all western states except     Idaho where construction starts in January were 5 percent below a     year earlier. In Utah, housing starts in January were running 53     percent above the previous January, though there was some concern     that the Administration's proposals to stop a number of western     water development projects would undermine this strength by the     second half of the year. Dry weather in usually wet Oregon has     allowed construction to boom. Very low vacancy rates (1.7 percent in     Corvallis) characterize many Oregon cities.
The price of homes in Southern California continues to advance     rapidly—by 39 percent in the past 12 months according to the     records of one banker. The reason for this, explains the president     of a construction company, is a rapid advance in land prices,     assisted at least partially by environmental and other restrictions.     Actual construction costs, he maintained, have remained fairly     stable over the past one to two years. Kern County (the nation's     leading agricultural producer) is experiencing a record housing boom     due both to recent oil activity and the flight of businesses out of     Los Angeles into the Bakersfield area.
Auto sales are reported good in Washington and Oregon, though big     cars are moving faster than the smaller models. Retail sales are     strong in Washington with Seattle's largest retailer reporting     appliance and furniture sales running at 20 to 25 percent above a     year ago. Consumer loan demand is quite strong in Southern     California. Three sets of labor contracts expire before midyear     (construction and dairy workers in Southern California and timber     workers in Oregon) and there is some concern about the outcome of     the associated negotiations. In aerospace, Boeing is reported to     have strong sales and rising employment.
