Businessmen in the Eighth District continue to be optimistic about     prospects for further economic gains in 1977.     Weather-induced     problems in January are expected to affect first quarter profits of     several firms, yet the view that the economy will continue to make     gains in 1977 has not been fundamentally altered. Retail sales in     February registered moderate gains over February of last year.     Manufacturing activity in such industries as chemicals, aircraft,     and construction-related equipment continues upward. Funds are     flowing into thrift institutions at a strong pace, auguring well for     future homebuilding, and major banks report rising business loan     demand.
February retail sales were moderately above those of a year ago     according to major St. Louis retail representatives. Retailers were     encouraged by this gain in view of the weather problems earlier this     year and the strong sales of February 1976 which were boosted by     unseasonally warm weather. One representative reported that sales of     such items as shoes, fabrics, and recreation products, have     performed well in recent months despite the adverse weather     conditions. Strong sales virtually exhausted stocks of many items,     such as heavy outer clothing, boots, and overshoes, although     reordering at this stage of the season is not contemplated.
While weather conditions and gas curtailments hampered activity of     some firms in January, normal weather in recent weeks has alleviated     most of these problems. Several firms report, however, that plant     closings, higher energy costs, shipping delays, high absenteeism,     and other problems will reduce first quarter earnings from what they     would have been otherwise. While the lost earnings may not be     recovered fully, firms report that a substantial amount of lost     production may he made up.
Several manufacturers report rising sales and orders in their lines     of business. A major chemical manufacturer reports that considerable     optimism is building up in this industry. Sales of fibers, most     industrial chemicals, petrochemicals, and herbicides are described     as good. Unused capacity for polystyrene production continues,     although sales are beginning to improve. A major aircraft     manufacturer has experienced some strength in commercial aircraft     orders. On the other hand, concern has increased over the     possibility of cutbacks in military aircraft which would severely     affect this industry. A small apparel manufacturer noted that orders     last fall were below expectations, but that orders now being taken     are up somewhat from last spring. A small manufacturer of welding     equipment reported that incoming orders have been excellent since     last fall. A paper manufacturer noted that sales were good in the     first two months of the year, although some softening has been     detected in the past couple of weeks. This manufacturer also     reported that prices of certain paper products have dropped since     the beginning of the year after a sharp run-up late last year.
Savings and loan associations had strong net inflows in February.     Those institutions continuing to offer ceiling rates on CDs are     attracting the largest volume of funds. Mortgage loan demand is said     to be moderate with interest rates unchanged in recent weeks.     Commercial banks in the District report a rising volume of time and     savings deposits. Representatives of commercial banks in St. Louis     report business loan demand has been excellent so far this year.     Bankers in some other areas of the District, such as Kentucky and     Indiana, however, report that loan demand is flat in their areas.
Chronic dry weather conditions and low subsoil moisture was     suggested by some respondents as a potential threat to this year's     crops. Such fears, however, are probably premature since the     planting season has not yet begun. Furthermore, recent precipitation     has been more substantial than in late 1976. According to planting     intention reports, Eighth District farmers are now planning to     increase soybean and sorghum acreage in 1977 over 1976, while     decreasing cotton and rice acreage. Corn acreage is expected to     remain unchanged.
