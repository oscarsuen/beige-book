The general consensus that emerges from the August district reports is of continued moderate growth in consumer spending and little prospect of significant advances in plant and equipment investment. Retail trade, particularly automobile sales remains strong and residential construction continues at a brisk pace. Concern over a slowdown in economic activity during the next six months has produced a cautious inventory strategy and restrained new business investment. Consumer loans remain strong, but sluggish business lending is common in most districts. The combined effects of bumper crops and drought have reduced farm income and increased agricultural indebtedness in many areas.
Consumer spending was generally strong during August. Solid gains in   department store sales were achieved in Boston, New York, Atlanta,   Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and Dallas, although Philadelphia   merchants describe sales as below expectations and St. Louis reports   only modest gains. Philadelphia and San Francisco report strong   sales of durables, such as furniture and appliances, matching the   growth in residential construction. Sales of 1977 model automobiles,   apparently stimulated by price increases announced for next year's   models, continued to be excellent in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas,   Kansas City, St. Louis, and San Francisco districts.
Both residential and non-residential construction continued their   vigorous advance in many areas, although scattered reports of labor   and material shortages have appeared. Dallas reports that housing   starts are down only slightly from the record June pace and that   shopping center construction in Texas is triple the level of last   year. The Atlanta, Chicago Kansas City, and St. Louis housing   markets remain robust. The housing boom continues on the west mast,   but San Francisco reports that the rate of increase has apparently   reached a plateau in most areas. While no district is experiencing a   shortage of mortgage funds, Chicago, St. Louis, Atlanta, and Dallas   report spot shortages of various building materials and skilled   construction workers.
Manufacturing activity presents a mixed picture, with materials   shortages appearing in some districts and concern over the health of   the steel industry growing in others. Dallas reports a continued   rise in industrial production, led by increases in the output of oil   field equipment and building materials. Shortages of brick and   cement are reported to be widespread, however. Record offshore oil   and gas production has stimulated shipbuilding activity in Atlanta,   but "serious shortages" of all types of oil handling equipment have   developed. In New York, production cutbacks announced by a major   steel producer will further retard the sluggish recovery of the   western part of the state. Cleveland expresses concern over layoffs   and salary cuts at steel plants in its district. Manufacturing   output continues to increase at a moderate rate in St. Louis,   particularly among consumer goods, although steel shipments are down   10 percent or more from year earlier levels and new orders for   several lines of chemicals slowed in August. Reports from other   districts are more optimistic. Growing manufacturing activity has   provided new jobs in Minneapolis, and is expected to continue to do   so. Shipments were generally up in Richmond, but new orders showed   little change. In Boston, on the other hand, a slight drop in   production reflecting normal seasonal influences is expected to be   reversed in the near future due to an increase in new orders for   defense goods. Philadelphia reports a rise in industrial production,   especially in durable goods, while Kansas City is experiencing an   energy-sector led increase in business activity.
Investment in inventories and capital projects may best be described   as cautious. In view of the slowdown in business activity expected   in many districts over the next six months, current low   inventory/sales ratios are generally regarded as satisfactory.   Inventories appear to be at desired levels in Boston, Philadelphia,   St. Louis and Dallas. Excessive inventories in specific industries   are mentioned by New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis. Business   surveys in the Richmond district suggest some unintended inventory   accumulation, with an increase in the number of respondents who view   their inventories as excessive. Less optimistic business   expectations are also reflected in the behavior of plant and   equipment expenditure. New York reports "very conservative" capital   spending plans; only 37 percent of firms surveyed in Philadelphia   plan increases in capital spending over the next six months; Kansas   City, Cleveland, and Atlanta cite energy and tax legislation as   important causes of business uncertainty; San Francisco sees capital   spending as generally weak in the west, with a significant portion   of new investment tied to pollution control equipment.
Loan demand continues its familiar pattern, with consumer loans,   particularly for automobiles, remaining strong and business loans   remaining flat in most districts. Commercial loans are up in Boston,   but the funds are being used primarily for plant modernization   rather than for new capacity. Atlanta and St. Louis note that a   recent court decision in Tennessee upholding the 10 percent limit on   consumer loan interest rates has caused a virtual halt in consumer   lending in that state. Bankers in the Cleveland, Kansas City, and   Philadelphia districts expressed fears of possible disintermediation   due to the recent rise in short rates, although current deposit   inflows have remained strong in these and other districts.
Agriculture is a particular concern in many districts. In some   areas, record harvests, by driving prices down, and unprecedented   drought, by driving costs up, have reduced farm income, increased   agricultural indebtedness, and decreased the demand for heavy   agricultural implements. This basic pattern is mentioned by Chicago,   Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. In other areas,   such as Boston, Richmond, and Atlanta, the crop-reducing effect of   the drought has had the most pronounced effect on farm income.   Atlanta notes that prices for Florida citrus fruits are double last   year's level, however.
