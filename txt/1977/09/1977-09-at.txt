Directors and other business reports from around the District are generally optimistic and indicate solid growth. Retail sales are strong. The housing boom continues to spread and gather momentum, straining supplies of some building materials. Energy development activities are at record levels. But the agricultural outlook remains dim despite small improvements in production prospects. A recent Tennessee court decision, strictly enforcing the Constitution's 10-percent interest rate ceiling, has cut off funds from finance companies and reduced bank lending, threatening consumer spending. Directors cite uncertainties about the direction of government policy, particularly the possible elimination of investment tax incentives, as the main cloud on the horizon.
Consumer spending is strong in most areas, with record retail sales   reported in southeast Florida and along the Gulf Coast. August auto   sales were excellent following announcements of price increases on   1978 models; many dealers expect healthy demand to carry over to the   new models. Some softness is evident in sales of higher-priced fall   apparel, notably menswear, and is causing inventories to back up at   Georgia textile mills.
Tennessee banks, finance companies, and credit unions are in a   lending quandary since an August 22 State Supreme Court decision   invalidated a statute which allowed lenders to skirt the   Constitution's 10-percent interest rate ceiling by using add-ons or   discounts. A pending class action suit on behalf of all borrowers   demands repayment of all interest in excess of 10 percent collected   on loans made by the state's lending institutions in the past five   years. A constitutional convention is currently considering   proposals to modify or remove the usury provision but will not be   able to get the issue before the voters until May or August of 1978.
The state's finance companies (there are nearly 500 with 450,000-500,000 borrowers), specifically affected by the decision, have   virtually ceased all cash lending and have laid off about 1,000   employees. Bank reactions indicate confusion as to interpretation of   the decision and fears that future challenges may extend strict   interpretation of the interest limitation. Interest charged by   stores and car dealers or on bank credit cards in financing specific   purchases has been exempted from the ceiling by an earlier court   decision, but the more recent ruling has been construed to apply to   bank loans for such purposes. Banks generally are making such loans   only to those established low-risk customers to whom they can   profitably lend at 10 percent or are offering 12-month, 10-percent   loans with final "balloon" payments, hoping the Constitution can be   amended in time to refinance. Some have cut off all small loans.   Most are still buying auto dealer paper. A few are escrowing   interest collected in excess of 10 percent.
State retail sales figures are not yet available to show the impact   of the credit dam. There have been some reports of lighter sales of   big-ticket durable goods; one director remarked on increased auto   sales by dealers just inside Kentucky. Displaced borrowers are   expected, wherever possible, to go out of state for financing; loan   activity has reportedly already risen at Mississippi banks in the   Memphis area.
Residential real estate sales and housing construction have   accelerated to an extremely rapid pace in Florida's coastal areas.   New apartments and condos account for much of the latest surge on   the "Space Coast." Vacant land has grown scarce in the Miami area,   encouraging speculation. A Florida director notes continuing   moderate real estate speculation along the north Gulf Coast.   Mortgage money is plentiful throughout the District, and loan   closings at savings and loans are up sharply. Farm real estate   activity has risen in Tennessee.
Plans to construct new hotels and expand tourist attractions   highlight moderate advances in nonresidential construction.   Announcements of plans to build shopping centers and large   industrial facilities have become more numerous in the Gulf states.   The latest round of announcements included a phosphate mine   expansion in central Florida, a headquarters relocation and new   industrial complex for the Melbourne area, and large army   construction projects in Mississippi. Commercial and industrial   growth in the Atlanta area has not kept pace with other District   cities. A foundry owner finds encouragement for business spending in   rising orders from capital goods producers.
Intense construction activity has resulted in delayed deliveries and   climbing prices of building materials, particularly in Florida.   Lumber supplies are low, and prices have risen as much as 20 percent   in the past three months; one Tennessee producer has been turning   down orders. Atlanta and Florida builders report shortages of   insulation materials.
August rainfall has improved crop production prospects, but harvests   of most crops will be considerably lighter this year than last. Pest   damage is unusually heavy; some pesticides are in short supply.   Despite extensive losses in some areas, the District's cotton and   soybean output should be abundant this fall, but sluggish demand and   soft prices for these and several other major cash crops will   restrain farm revenues. However, rising demand and expectations of   low supplies are allowing citrus growers to sell production in   advance of the season for the first time in years, at prices nearly   double last year's. Livestock liquidation has slowed as pastures   revived. Purchased feed costs have fallen, enlarging profit margins   of poultry and hog producers, but depressed local corn and hay   production will make beef cattle herds difficult to maintain through   the winter.
Oil and gas industry activity, both onshore and in the Gulf, is at   an all-time high. Some shipbuilders, benefiting from larger volumes   of oil-related jobs and preparations for East Coast drilling to   begin soon, are experiencing serious shortages of all types of oil-handling equipment. Others remain concerned about maintaining   sufficient work levels despite improvements; layoffs by New Orleans   and Pascagoula shipyards probably won't be as severe as originally   announced but will be substantial at best.
