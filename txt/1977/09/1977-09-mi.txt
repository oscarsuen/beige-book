Despite some trouble spots, the Ninth District's economy is currently quite strong, and directors seem generally optimistic. Several regions are suffering from strikes and layoffs, but employment is up in large urban areas, and more gains are expected. Manufacturing sales gains have been sizable all year, and although they are expected to moderate somewhat, most manufacturers are satisfied with current inventories and plant and equipment. For most farmers, low grain prices are still taking the luster off the expected large harvest, but income prospects have improved for some. As a result, many district consumers have increased their spending recently, and retailers expect good sales this fall. Borrowing has increased too, both to support the expanding industries and the spending consumers and to refinance farm debt.
But labor market conditions are strong in the large urban areas,   according to directors. Employment has grown considerably over last   year, and unemployment is down. The Minneapolis/St. Paul area   unemployment rate, for example, is currently 5.1 percent compared to   6.5 percent a year ago. Most of the new jobs are reportedly in   construction, trade, and service industries. And the prospects for   further job growth are considered good.
Despite the overall slowing in sales growth, most manufacturers   don't seem to expect any sharp drop in activity: Only electric   machinery manufacturers consider their current inventories and plant   and equipment capacities excessive through early 1978.
Directors do see signs of possible improvement for some farmers,   however. Good crops are expected in last year's drought areas, so   despite the low prices farmers there could have more cash to spend   this year than last. The low grain prices will probably improve the   profitability of those who feed grain to dairy cattle, poultry,   and hogs. And the pending farm legislation's price supports should   help bolster farm income generally.
Bank lending has been quite strong recently too. District consumers   and businesses have increased their borrowing, and farmers have gone   further into debt.
