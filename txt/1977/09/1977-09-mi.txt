Despite some trouble spots, the Ninth District's economy is currently quite strong, and directors seem generally optimistic. Several regions are suffering from strikes and layoffs, but employment is up in large urban areas, and more gains are expected. Manufacturing sales gains have been sizable all year, and although they are expected to moderate somewhat, most manufacturers are satisfied with current inventories and plant and equipment. For most farmers, low grain prices are still taking the luster off the expected large harvest, but income prospects have improved for some. As a result, many district consumers have increased their spending recently, and retailers expect good sales this fall. Borrowing has increased too, both to support the expanding industries and the spending consumers and to refinance farm debt.
Large strikes and layoffs are currently depressing employment in   several district areas. The iron ore workers' strike has cut job   growth in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and northeastern   Minnesota. And a large copper producer in Upper Michigan has laid   off a substantial number of workers.
But labor market conditions are strong in the large urban areas,   according to directors. Employment has grown considerably over last   year, and unemployment is down. The Minneapolis/St. Paul area   unemployment rate, for example, is currently 5.1 percent compared to   6.5 percent a year ago. Most of the new jobs are reportedly in   construction, trade, and service industries. And the prospects for   further job growth are considered good.
Strong manufacturing activity has been providing new jobs too and   will probably continue to, though some easing is expected. After   sales gains of 14 percent over a year ago during the first half,   district manufacturers responding to our latest quarterly survey   think their sales will increase 13 percent in the current quarter,   10 percent in the fourth quarter, and 8 percent in the first quarter   of 1978. Gains in durable goods sales are expected to slow from 16   percent in the third quarter to 10 percent and 8 percent in the next   two quarters. Sales of nondurable goods, meanwhile, should increase   a fairly steady 8 percent.
Despite the overall slowing in sales growth, most manufacturers   don't seem to expect any sharp drop in activity: Only electric   machinery manufacturers consider their current inventories and plant   and equipment capacities excessive through early 1978.
Directors still consider agricultural conditions generally   troubling. Although harvests are expected to be excellent this fall—"spectacular" in some places—prices are very low, so most   farmers' income probably won't match last year's. Recent rains may   have set back North Dakota farmers even further; they have delayed   wheat harvesting and so could substantially cut yields there. The   Administration's plan to cut back wheat production is worrying some   directors, particularly in Montana where farmers have few production   alternatives. And the impact of low grain prices on cattle producers   is still unclear.
Directors do see signs of possible improvement for some farmers,   however. Good crops are expected in last year's drought areas, so   despite the low prices farmers there could have more cash to spend   this year than last. The low grain prices will probably improve the   profitability of those who feed grain to dairy cattle, poultry,   and hogs. And the pending farm legislation's price supports should   help bolster farm income generally.
Because of the somewhat brighter ag outlook and the strength in   other industries, directors say many district consumers have   increased their spending recently. The labor strikes and layoffs are   depressing spending in Upper Michigan and northeastern Minnesota.   But otherwise both large urban areas and rural communities report   stronger retail sales. And most of the district expects this   strength to continue into the fall.
Bank lending has been quite strong recently too. District consumers   and businesses have increased their borrowing, and farmers have gone   further into debt.
