Economic activity in the Third District is expanding at an uneven pace. Department store sales are mixed, while activity in the region's manufacturing sector continues to increase. New orders and shipments are higher in September, and factory employment and the workweek also show signs of improvement. Manufacturer's inventories are down somewhat this month. For the longer term, retailers and manufacturers are less than optimistic. Most merchants expect a continuation of the recent trend of weak sales growth. In addition, the proportion of sampled manufacturers anticipating better business conditions six months out is the lowest in over two and a half years. Commercial bankers say that consumer borrowing remains strong, but business loan demand, although better of late, is still weak.
Manufacturers responding to the latest Business Outlook Survey   report that business is improving in September. Of the executives   surveyed, 26 percent say that business is better than last month,   while 9 percent say it is worse. New orders and shipments are higher   in September, and moderate gains in employment are reported as well.   Both work forces and the average workweek are increasing for the   first time since June. Inventories, however, are reported to be down   somewhat after holding steady for the past four months.
Overall, the pickup in manufacturing activity in the District   appears to be more widespread in durables than in nondurables.   Comments by Directors of this Bank support this observation. Two   Directors, whose companies manufacture nondurables, report that   business has been slow over the last six months. While one is unsure   about the future, the other expects a recent pickup to gain   strength. Another Director, a manufacturer of durables, says   business is better than anticipated, and looks for additional   expansion next year.
Despite the improvement in general business conditions in the   current period, manufacturers are not very optimistic for the longer   term. In the latest survey, 43 percent of the respondents anticipate   improvement in economic conditions over the next two quarters.   Expectations of gains six months out are now less widespread than   they've been in over two and a half years. Increases in new orders   and shipments are anticipated at about half the sampled firms. These   are the lowest proportions projecting increases in these categories   in a year. At the same time, inventories are expected to be   unchanged over the period, and little growth is anticipated in   employment. Thirty-seven percent of the sampled firms project   increases in capital spending over the next six months. This   proportion is roughly unchanged from last month.
Prices in the industrial sector continue to increase, although   prices received by manufacturers are climbing at a slightly slower   pace than in August. Forty-six percent of those surveyed report   paying more for inputs, while 23 percent say they are receiving   higher prices for the products they sell. For the longer term, 4 out   of 5 project higher prices for raw materials by March, while 3 out   of 5 look for higher prices for their finished products. This latter   proportion is down somewhat from August.
Reports from retailers indicate that department store sales in the   area are mixed. Current dollar sales are reported to be between 2   and 22 percent above September '76 levels. Hard goods, specifically   furniture, are selling extremely well. However, while one merchant   says sales are better than anticipated, most say they are below   expectations. In general, suburban stores are doing better than   those located in downtown Philadelphia. Retailers say their   inventories are in good shape overall, and feel they would not be   overstocked if a period of extreme softness developed.
As for the outlook, most merchants contacted are "cautiously   optimistic" about economic conditions between now and March. While   one expects to see March sales 15 percent above year-earlier levels,   others look for gains in the 5 to 7 percent range. Retailers do not   seem to be concerned either that high levels of consumer installment   debt will be putting a damper on sales in the latter part of the   year, or about the possibility of a downturn in the economy next   year.
Bankers in the region report that consumer loan demand continues to   be strong, but that business loan activity, while better in recent   weeks, is still below expectations. Reports of current levels of C&I   loans range from 3 percent below to 8 percent above year-ago levels.   Most of the bankers contacted say that although borrowing by local   business is at or above expected levels, the national market   continues to be depressed. They feel that the national sluggishness   results, in part, from the availability of alternative sources of   funds to larger firms.
For the longer term, most of the bankers contacted anticipate   expansion of business borrowing through the first quarter of 1978,   with business loans at that time 6 to 7 percent above March '77   levels. Interest rates are projected to climb, with the prime rate,   currently at 7 percent at all of the banks contacted, expected to   rise to 7 1/4 - 7 1/2 percent by March.
Bankers appear to be only "mildly worried" that the rising short-term rates will cut off savings inflows. They anticipate real growth   in the 3 to 5 percent range next year, and do not expect that higher   short-term interest rates will lower this rate of growth.
