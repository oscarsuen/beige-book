As the year draws to a close, virtually all informed observers in the Seventh District are confident that the expansion will continue well into 1978, perhaps through the year. Retail sales have been at satisfactory levels, and inventories are generally well balanced. Price increases in many industrial markets have been restrained by competition, but the underlying trend is still strongly upward. Orders for steel have improved. The capital goods sector continues to improve with a bigger boost from nonresidential construction. The agricultural sector remains weak with some optimism generated by the recent rise in grain prices. Credit is generally available, but some rural banks are hard-pressed to accommodate farmers who have been forced to renew loans.
Professional forecasters in the district have predicted increases in   real GNP for next year ranging from 3.5 to 5.5 percent. No one seems   to be forecasting a recession. Most expect price inflation to   accelerate somewhat next year for various reasons including: a   bottoming out of farm prices, moves for protection, the higher   minimum wage, increased social insurance taxes, rising wages, and   higher income supplements—both private and public. Views differ on   the desirability of a large reduction in federal taxes. Some   professional forecasters believe that a substantial tax cut is   necessary to sustain the expansion, while others, probably more   numerous, believe that a cut of $20 to $25 billion is not large   enough to make a significant difference in a $2 trillion economy.
Sales of general merchandise were adversely affected by extremely   cold weather in the first third of December, but prospects for the   Christmas season remain excellent. Sales of soft goods had begun to   improve relative to hard goods in October and November, but hard   goods—especially appliances, home improvement items, and auto   parts—continue to show the largest gains. Some retail executives   believe that recent heavy use of installment credit will moderate.   Nevertheless, delinquency experience continues to be excellent. The   use of bank cards continues to expand with another department store   chain added to the list of users.
The airlines have been pleased with larger than expected (10 to 12   percent) increases in traffic over year ago starting in October.   Only part of the gain can be attributed to cut-rate fares on certain   routes.
Recent adjustments in auto production schedules clearly reflect   sales falling short of expectations. Success of the new smaller   models, in doubt at present, is necessary if 1978 sales are to equal   or exceed 1977 as auto executives have predicted. There is greater   confidence that sales of light trucks will continue at high levels.   All makes have expanded capacity to produce vans, which have been in   short supply. Sales of heavy-duty trucks and trailers continue on a   plateau, and at least one maker has cut production.
Orders for capital goods continue to expand overall. Sales of   virtually all types of farm equipment have been far below year ago   levels, however. Among the strongest capital goods sectors have been   components: castings, fluid power, mechanical and electrical drives   and controls, bearings, and electric motors. Some producers of these   items report that inquiries suggest a shift toward larger projects   for expansion and modernization, as opposed to orders for off-the-shelf items for replacement and maintenance. Manufacturers of   capital equipment, except for some specialties, have expanded   capacity substantially since 1974, and could accommodate additional   orders.
Steel orders began to improve in November and order books are   filling up for early 1978. Pressure to curb imports and possible   shortages resulting from extended coal/ore strikes may be temporary   factors. A major district producer, however, cited an improvement in   orders for plates, bars, and structurals, which are associated with   a rise in capital goods production.
Prospects for nonresidential construction continue to improve.   Except for the auto industry, planned industrial projects are   relatively small, e.g., light manufacturing and distribution   centers. Plans for new office buildings and hotels are significantly   stronger in the Chicago area, both in the Loop and in favored   suburbs. Retail store construction also is picking up in the   district, but only for smaller "community" shopping centers. No   large "regional" centers are needed in the near future. Some huge "closed mall" type shopping centers still are not operating at   planned levels.
Residential construction should be at a high level again in 1978.   Sales of new and existing units continue strong with prices 10 to 12   percent above year ago. More and more existing apartment buildings   are being converted to condominiums. Apartment construction is   picking up, but on a highly selective basis. Rents will have to rise   substantially further to justify major rental projects because   rising costs of construction and operation are out-pacing rents. The   rise in construction labor costs has moderated, but prices of   lumber, insulation, and other materials are up 20 to 50 percent from   year ago.
Although incomes of grain and livestock farmers have been sharply   reduced, to the point of bankruptcy in some cases, the agricultural   picture is not all bad. Fruit and dairy farmers have had good to   excellent results this year.
