The pace of economic activity in the Second District continues to expand moderately, according to directors and other business leaders who were contacted recently. Retailers are optimistic about holiday merchandising as department store sales quickened in early December, after some sluggishness early in the season. Retail inventories remain on the high side, though. Containerized port activity rebounded with the settlement of the dock strike, but district employment continues to grow only slowly. On the financial front, the persistent sluggishness in business loan demand appears to have prompted some New York City banks to take aggressive measures to encourage borrowing.
Department store sales strengthened in early December and district   merchants are optimistic about Christmas-sales prospects. According   to leading retailers, sales slowed in late November but posted   sizable gains in early December. Several department store executives   attributed the softening in late November to the unseasonably warm   weather that followed Thanksgiving. As a result of the subsequent   pickup in consumer purchases, most merchants expected a strong   Christmas buying season. In New York City, retailers' assessments of   the outlook ranged from "very optimistic" to "pretty good."   Directors of the Buffalo branch reported that, despite the large   layoffs by the steel industry, the sales experience in Western New   York suggested a very strong holiday merchandising season. For the   most part, retailers' reports on inventories suggested that stocks   were high. Respondents emphasized that inventory positions are   extremely difficult to assess at this time since so much depends on   the strength of sales for the remainder of the holiday season. One   respondent, nevertheless, felt that price markdowns would be   required to bring stocks down to satisfactory levels. Reports on new   car sales suggested that the district developments reflected   national conditions. Area auto dealers reported an unexpected drop-off in new car sales in November. As a result, auto inventories were   characterized as "very high."
In the industrial sector, comments of district business leaders   continue to paint a mixed picture. According to the Buffalo branch   directors, orders for industrial goods in upstate New York appear to   be holding steady. More positively, the chief economist of a major   paper firm noted a significant pickup in paper orders. For the most   part, district industrialists reported ample unused capacity and had   few plans to step up capital spending in 1978. Most expenditures   appear to be aimed at replacing or modernizing existing plant and   equipment, and few new capacity additions seem planned. One   exception appears to be the petroleum industry. The economist of a   major oil corporation stated that his firm planned large   expenditures and that drilling activity for the industry as a whole   was at a sixteen-year high.
Construction activity appears to be gaining some momentum, but   continues to lag behind the nation. Several businessmen reported a   pickup in residential construction activity in recent months.   Nevertheless, joblessness among building trades workers remains   high. Indeed, in order to encourage further construction activity, a   bricklayers union in New York City has accepted more than a ten   percent cut in wage rates for specific types of jobs.
Part of the general gloom of the region's sluggish employment   picture has been dispelled by the settlement of the dock workers   strike. In the wake of the settlement, employment and port activity   rebounded as shippers attempted to move the backlog of imported   merchandise to distributors and retailers. But some depressants to   the district business climate remain. Cutbacks in steel production   are continuing in the Western region of the district. Also, in New   York State, an appeals court ruling overturned a lower court   decision that had declared unconstitutional the payment of   unemployment benefits to strikers.
Business loan demand continues to lag in the district. Partly as a   consequence, one major New York City bank has introduced a new   lending facility to accommodate commercial paper borrowers. The   program involves very short-term lending at terms only slightly   above the Federal funds rate. The facility is designed to provide   borrowers a temporary alternative when paper financing is either   relatively unattractive or not feasible. According to a senior   lending officer of the bank, only a few dozen borrowers have used   the facility in its initial month of operation, but other potential   users appear to be interested. At least one competing bank has   reportedly responded by matching this lending rate. Because of the   pervasive sluggishness of lending demands, a few banks are   reportedly foregoing compensating balance requirements, on a highly   selective basis, on loans to prime customers or lending at somewhat   below the prime rate. Outside of New York City, loan demand appears   flat in Western New York, and Buffalo directors report no visible   prospect for a turnaround in the near term.
