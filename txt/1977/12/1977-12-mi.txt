Despite some business uncertainty, the Ninth District economy is quite healthy in late 1977. Both retail and manufacturing sales are expanding briskly. Mortgage funds are available to support the district's current high level of homebuilding. And the region's two weak areas, iron ore mining and agriculture, are slightly improved. However, directors' comments indicate that uncertainty about the Administration's economic policies is holding back some investment spending.
District manufacturing sales are strong too; overall they are   stronger than expected. During the first nine months of this year,   manufacturing sales were up about 14 percent from a year ago, but in   August manufacturers expected only a 10 percent increase in the   fourth quarter. In November, however, manufacturers reported a   fourth-quarter sales gain about the same size as the rest of the   year (with durable goods sales up 17 percent; nondurable goods   sales, 11 percent). This pickup in business has not resulted in any   inventory shortages or capacity problems. It has, though, increased   manufacturing employment about 4 percent over a year ago.
