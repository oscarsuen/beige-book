Homebuilding is another important source of strength for the district economy. A record number of building permits has been issued this year for residential dwellings. Also, last month's concerns about disintermediation have not materialized, so funds are still available to accommodate a high level of homebuilding. Although some sophisticated investors have shifted funds from savings deposits to higher yielding money market instruments, this Bank's directors report that higher interest rates on U.S. government securities have had little effect on the growth of time and savings deposits in their communities. Improving iron ore mining and agriculture
Not only are the district's strong sectors still expanding, but the two weak sectors look better than they did last month. The striking iron ore workers appear to be closer to reaching a settlement; several locals have already signed contracts. Ending these disputes would do much to boost economic activity in northeastern Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In the other trouble spot, agriculture, the subsidy payments to farmers under the recent farm legislation are being made this month. They should help offset some of the current weakness in district farm receipts. In fact, a Montana director thinks December wheat subsidy payments in his county will total about $8 million. This would be about $20,000 for a farmer with an average-sized farm. Business uncertainty
Even though the district's economy is currently quite strong, uncertainty about the Administration's economic policies is dampening plant and equipment spending. Two directors associated with large manufacturing firms say uncertainty about the tax and energy programs is holding back some investment outlays. And a regional economic survey by a director's large Minneapolis bank found that a lack of confidence was limiting investment spending in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area.
