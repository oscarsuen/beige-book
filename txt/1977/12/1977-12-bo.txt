Industrialists, retailers and bankers in the First District report that economic trends have changed little in the last month. Some soft spots in the region s economy have been offset by stronger growth in other areas. Retail sales are doing well. Commercial loan demand has been strengthening and production continues to improve. Respondents have not seen any sharp price increases in recent months and there is very little concern about shortages of materials or fuels during 1978.
Retail sales continue to improve across the District. In northern   New England bankers report significant increases in credit card   usage as a result of very strong consumer sales. Massachusetts   retailers have seen strong sales in the last two weeks, partly as a   result of a change in state laws allowing stores to remain open on   Sunday from Thanksgiving to Christmas. However, Connecticut, which   already had Sunday sales, is also enjoying very strong demand. Some   department store retailers feel that part of the increase in their   business may be coming at the expense of a slowdown in auto sales.
The chief executive officer of a large soft goods chain expressed   continued concern about inventories. He believes that while strong   Christmas sales will enable many stores with excessive inventories   to work them off, retailers will have to slow down purchases from   manufacturers. As a result of the East Coast dock strike some stores   will not receive goods they have already purchased in time for this   Christmas rush. This could contribute to inventory problems later   on.
Connecticut has been troubled by layoffs and plant closings in some   areas. These reflect the difficulties of individual firms more than   an overall slowdown. These job losses are also likely to be offset   by strong employment increases in other industries from defense   contracts and very strong demand for machine tools and fabricated   metal products. Construction activity remains uniformly slow across   the region. Respondents indicate that there have been increases in   the number of firms bidding for new work and that the price   competition is intense.
None of the Redbook respondents are experiencing any difficulty in   obtaining materials, labor, or energy. Although material prices were   not reported softening there was some indication that posted   increases are not sticking. In part this may reflect suppliers'   raising list prices because of a concern that price controls may be   imposed and then discounting these increases away. While energy   prices are increasing, no supply difficulties are expected and the   coal strike is unlikely to affect any of the firms queried.
Several large industrial firms continued to express concern about   capital formation. Uncertainty about future tax and energy policy   was mentioned by one large electronics firm as having a depressive   effect on investment spending. The chairman of a highly diversified   conglomerate indicates that the problems of the steel industry have   been a drag in the capital goods sector.
Professors Houthakker, Solow, Eckstein, and Samuelson were available   for comment this month. Houthakker does not believe that the recent   wholesale prices suggest accelerating inflation. Because unit labor   costs are well-behaved, the major concern is that the domestic   prices of exported goods as well as of imported goods will rise   substantially due to continuing devaluation of the dollar.   Houthakker is worried about the Fed's apparent inability to control   money aggregates. For each aggregate, the stated growth target   should be a single number rather than a range. The tolerance range   should reflect the uncertainties of control and should not obscure   the goal of policy.
Solow is also concerned about monetary targets. If the Fed is aiming   for 9 percent M2 growth, then a realistic target would place 9   percent at midrange rather than at the upper limit. Accordingly, the   misunderstandings accompanying modest overshoots can be avoided. In   this vein, "an attempt to mop up any excess money growth over some   target which might not have been appropriate adds unnecessarily to   downside risks in 1978."
Eckstein believes that there is no reason to raise interest rates at   this time, a policy of watchful waiting is appropriate. With real   growth of only about 4.3 percent, the unemployment rate will fall   only .3 percentage points next year. Any additional restraint will   sacrifice this already modest performance, and should interest rates   rise as much as 75 basis points, a near recession is possible.
Samuelson believes that the outlook for next year has improved   recently; nevertheless, real income will require help to reach a 5   percent growth target. If adequate growth requires higher levels of   investment spending, the cost and availability of finance must   improve. Accordingly, monetary policy must be prepared to be lenient   should the prospects for future capital spending remain weak.   Samuelson also believes that there is little virtue in maintaining   capacity utilization rates as low as 83 percent. Although "it makes   things easier for macro controllers by having an invalid economy," utilization rates as high as 88 percent are acceptable.
