Business activity in the Eighth Federal Reserve District continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent weeks. Consumer spending has advanced in line with expectations of most retailers, but few inventory excesses have developed. In the financial sector, credit demands remain strong. Time deposits at commercial banks have increased substantially, largely reflecting sales of large CDs. Savings inflows at savings and loan associations continue to increase, but at a more moderate rate than earlier in the year. In the manufacturing sector some gains continue to be made in most industries. Home building remains at a high level for this season of the year. In the farm sector, the income picture has shown some promise for improvement as a result of recent increases in farm commodity prices. Farmers are reported to be holding and storing a larger proportion of their 1977 crops than usual.
Consumer spending has continued above year ago levels according to   area retailers. Major department store representatives report that   recent sales have been in line with their expectations. Appliance   sales at department stores have been especially large in recent   weeks. Automobile sales are also reported to be up from year ago   levels. Some weakness was noted in women's apparel items, but this   was believed to be the result of some unfavorable weather and was   viewed as temporary.
Most retailing and manufacturing firms report inventories are at   desired levels. However, some product lines—including some   chemicals, paints and coatings, and furniture—were reported to be   larger than desired. On the other hand, a manufacturer of connector   plates used in construction experienced greater than expected sales   in recent weeks and some rundown in inventories. Also, inventories   of some building materials, principally insulation and storm doors   and windows, are well below desired levels.
In the financial sector, commercial banks report that demand remains   quite strong for real estate, consumer, and agricultural loans.   Demand for commercial and industrial loans has also increased in the   past two months. Savings and loan institutions, however, report that   home mortgage loan demand has leveled off since last summer.
Total time and savings deposits at commercial banks have increased   rapidly in recent months. Time deposits, primarily large   certificates of deposits, have increased quite rapidly, more than   offsetting a decline in small consumer-type savings deposits.   Savings inflows at savings and loan associations have continued to   advance, but at a more moderate rate than earlier in the year.
Production of manufactured goods generally continues to advance.   Production of capital goods—such as motors, railroad cars, and   welding and cutting equipment—were reported to have made further   advances. A manufacturer of capital goods reported, however, that   although appropriations for capital goods are quite strong, orders   had not been as good as expected.
A sizable backlog of orders continues in the home construction   industry in parts of the District. In some cases, new home buyers   are waiting two months or more beyond original scheduled dates for   completion. Unfavorable weather is hampering efforts to get back on   schedule.
Reports indicate that farmers are holding a larger proportion of   their fall crop off the market than in recent years as a result of   the relatively low farm commodity prices. It is estimated that only   about 25 percent of the 1977 cotton crop and about 10 percent of the   soybean crop has been sold. As a result, farm storage facilities for   crops have increased very rapidly this year. Farm income prospects   have improved somewhat in recent weeks, reflecting the recent rise   in farm commodity prices.
In early December an electrical power emergency developed in the TVA   service area and customers were asked to cut back electrical   consumption. The situation developed as seven large generating units   required repairs (five unexpectedly) at the same time and a   substantial rise in electrical power demands occurred due to sharply   lower temperatures. Repairs for rest of the units are expected to be   completed by the second week of December.
