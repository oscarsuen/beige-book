The pace of business activity in the Fifth District showed little change in July, judging from responses to our latest survey. Levels of manufacturers' shipments, new orders, and backlogs of orders were essentially unchanged from a month earlier. Inventories of materials also showed little change while stocks of finished goods continued to grow. Nonetheless, a majority of the respondents now feel current inventories are in line with desired levels. Price increases were less widespread than in most recent months. The outlook of the manufacturers surveyed, while still less optimistic than that of several months ago, has changed little since May and remains basically positive. Loan activity at District weekly reporting banks has slowed somewhat in recent weeks, but consumer and real estate loan demand remain strong. Directors of the Richmond Fed and its Branches report that retail sales in July were little changed from June except for increases in sales of cooling equipment and sale merchandise.
According to a majority of our manufacturing respondents, shipments   were unchanged in July as were backlogs of orders. About one third   reported increases in new orders but nearly as many reported   declines. The textile industry continued to report a relatively weak   orders picture while the electrical equipment group reported some   strength. Results from most other industries were mixed. Reports on   inventories were also uneven. Stocks of materials apparently rose   very little while finished goods stocks expanded across a broad   front. While most respondents are satisfied with current inventory   levels, there is some disparity among individual industries in this   regard. The textile industry appears to be holding larger   inventories than desired, but there is some indication that stocks   in the paper, chemical, and buildings supplies industries may be   below desired levels. Employment among manufacturers surveyed seems   to have risen very little in July and the length of the average work   week may have declined slightly. Employee compensation continued to   rise across a broad front as did other prices paid and received,   although the increases in prices paid by manufacturers were less   widespread than in recent months. Current plant and equipment   capacity remains basically in line with desired levels as do current   expansion plans.
Our Directors report good prospects for a substantial pick up in   apartment building during the second half of the year. Several   Directors cited evidence that this pick up is already under way in   their areas. Concerning the prospects for energy supplies, most of   the Directors anticipate at least some shortages over the next year,   but there is no indication that any serious problems are expected to   arise.
Business loan activity at major banks in the District has been soft   recently, due mainly to reduced demand from the manufacturing   sector. Larger District banks have also run off holdings of bankers'   acceptances, and this has acted to depress the recent loan data.   Wholesale, and especially retail businesses have increased their   demand for bank loans. Recent data notwithstanding, the general   feeling seems to be that business credit demands will strengthen in   the months ahead. A large North Carolina bank, for example, expects   its textile customers to seek inventory financing. A Maryland bank   sees a continuation of strong business loan demand, especially in   term lending. One area of concern is the agribusiness sector,   especially the tobacco industry. A Virginia bank that normally   provides heavy credit support to this sector expects drought   conditions to disturb the seasonal lending patterns to the tobacco   industry.
District cash farm income for the five months ending in Hay showed   an 8 percent increase over a year ago, compared with about a 2   percent gain nationally, but it seems unlikely that this margin of   difference will be maintained as the year progresses. Drought   conditions worsened considerably during July and early August,   cutting prospective crop yields, reducing quality of the tobacco,   and causing a sharp decline in pasture conditions. Beef cattle   farmers, especially those in North and South Carolina and Virginia   are selling their herds—reportedly in record numbers in the   Carolinas—in an effort to cope with the lack of forage. Corn has   been especially hard hit, and some of the drought-damaged crop is   now being harvested for silage and hay. Soybeans have also been hurt   seriously. Moreover, flue-cured tobacco prices thus far are   averaging significantly below a year ago because of the lower   quality of offerings. Although there may be some improvement in   average prices as the marketing season moves along, production as of   July 1 was expected to be around 13 percent short of the 1976 crop.
