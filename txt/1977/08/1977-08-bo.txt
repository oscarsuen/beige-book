Directors and other Redbook respondents in the First District report continued strong but not spectacular growth in the regional economy. Retail sales have been good and there has been some pick-up in the production of capital goods and in industrial loan demand. Although inventories are being monitored closely they are not at disturbing levels. No escalation in the rate of price increases has been seen nor are capacity problems or shortages in evidence.
A director from a large department store chain indicates that sales   in late July were about 8 percent above the same period in the   previous year. Economists for this chain's parent corporation are   forecasting a continuation of strong sales through 1977 but with   some slippage expected after the turn of the year. A Connecticut   director reports that retail sales in that state were unexpectedly   strong in July, especially in downtown areas, and that retailers are   more optimistic than they have been in some time. In northern New   England retail sales are also strong, in part because of a   particularly successful tourist season. Retailers are said to be   watching inventories closely. They are somewhat higher than desired   but not excessive; so there is not likely to be a need for major   corrections.
Several directors report that tourist activity is very strong. In   northern New England it looks like the busiest season in many years.   The America's Cup trials are creating a boom in parts of Rhode   Island, and Cape Cod is also doing very well.
In manufacturing, several producers of capital goods report that   sales are picking up and that order backlogs are building. Among the   areas mentioned are heavy capital equipment, commercial airplanes,   machine tools and equipment used by the auto industry. Sales of a   product used in building chemical plants, which had been weak   earlier, are improving. However a director of a large chemical   company reports that firms had a significant decline in sales in   July.
Both a medium sized bank in northern New England and a large   Connecticut bank report increases in industrial loan demand. In the   north this increase comes after several months of quite strong   demand; whereas in Connecticut the pick-up is very recent. However,   this improvement in the Connecticut situation is confirmed by   reports that a number of firms in the state are planning substantial   capital programs later this year and in 1978. However, most spending   is expected to be for machinery for modernization rather than for   plant expansion.
No capacity constraints or bottlenecks were reported. However one   consulting firm economist expressed concern about specialty bearings   and a director indicated that he expected water problems in the west   to constrain aluminum production. All of the First District Redbook   respondents expect prices to continue to increase at approximately a   five to six percent rate.
Professors Houthakker, Samuelson, and Tobin were available for   comment this month. Houthakker is encouraged by the recent behavior   of commodity prices. He urges the Chairman to speak out more   strongly against import restrictions; steel prices must be driven   down, even if some U.S. firms are driven to bankruptcy. Houthakker   opposes an increase in the discount rate at the present time in   order to avoid the impression that the Fed has brought about a   slowdown, if there is one. He believes it is important to get Ml   growth back down into the target range. This step is also all that   needs be done for the dollar. Intervention to support the dollar at   unrealistic levels is not necessary at present when there are no   clear distortions.
Noting a trend among monetarists to place greater weight on N2,   Samuelson argued that M2 is a preferable targetâ€”Ml should be   allowed to rise so long as M2 is not grossly misbehaving. If there   is a conflict between interest rates and aggregates, both sides must "compromise on the purity" of their positions. A possible desirable   compromise would be a sharp rise in the discount rate, as a signal   of the seriousness of our intentions to curb inflation, but a   relatively permissive posture on reserves. Admittedly, any   compromise will be criticized by those who dwell exclusively on   either target.
Tobin takes the sluggishness in labor markets and the weakness in   the stock market as indications that the economy is not booming.   This suggests that velocity may have begun to slowdown. If the   slowdown in velocity does occur, the present monetary growth targets   may come into conflict with sustained economic growth. The targets,   however, are self-imposed and could successfully be abandoned if   accompanied by an eloquent statement by the Chairman on the   looseness of the relationship between GNP and money growth. Tobin   opposes increases in the federal funds rate or the discount rate.
