The rate of growth in business activity may have slowed recently   according to this month's District reports, but the trend continues   moderately upward. Consumer spending continues to increase; however,   demand for soft goods was reported to be weak in some of the   Districts. Inventories are generally being maintained at   satisfactory levels. Business loan demand remains relatively weak at   the larger centers, but some pickup in demand is reported by a few   Districts. Mortgage funds are ample at current interest rates.   Strong loan demand and high loan-to-deposit ratios were reported in   some of the agricultural communities. Residential construction   continues at a high rate and signs of rising industrial construction   were noted. Upward price pressures remain strong, particularly for   construction materials. Prospects are for a relatively large output   of farm commodities, lower average farm product prices, and little   growth in cash farm receipts from a year ago.
Consumer spending generally continues up, but signs of weakness were   noted in some of the Districts. Apparel and soft goods sales were   reported to be weak by Chicago and St. Louis. Reduced sales were   reported in the rural communities by Minneapolis. Prior to an   upsurge in July, an overall trend toward slower retail sales growth   in the second quarter was reported by San Francisco. On the other   hand, sales of hardware, excluding automobiles, continued   persistently upward and a recent upturn in total retail sales was   reported by Philadelphia, Cleveland, and San Francisco. Automobile   sales were mixed with Dallas and San Francisco reporting continuing   strong sales while Cleveland and St. Louis reported some easing off   of such sales in July.
Business inventories, with a few exceptions, are in satisfactory   condition. Continued shortages and delays in delivery are still   found in the construction industry. Chicago and St. Louis, for   example, reported some delivery lags for insulation, brick, drywall,   plumbing fixtures, lumber, and millwork. San Francisco reported that   automobile dealers are having difficulty in stocking all types of   cars. Somewhat fewer "shortages," however, were reported in   inventory items than heretofore, especially for raw materials used   in making tools and metal fixtures. Also a few inventory excesses   were reported. New York reported that mounting inventories are   becoming a problem for some businesses, and Cleveland reported that,   while inventories are not excessive, they are sufficient to dampen   further inventory growth this quarter.
Manufacturing activity continued strongly upward according to most   District reports. Boston reported rising capital goods output and a   buildup in order backlogs. Further gains in the manufacturing sector   were reported by Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas   City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Somewhat counter to the general   movement was the mixed situation reported by New York and some   leveling off by Richmond.
Those Districts commenting on construction indicate a continuing up   trend in residential building and the beginning of a recovery in   commercial and industrial building. Construction of homes was   reported at virtual capacity by Chicago, strongly upward by St.   Louis, and strong by Minneapolis and Dallas. New York reports   tentative signs of a recovery in real estate and construction, and   San Francisco reported early indications of a pickup in   nonresidential construction.
The comments on price expectations varied greatly from District to   District. However, the prices of construction materials appear to be   rising rapidly and prices for most farm products are declining.   Boston sees no escalation in the rate of price increases. Less   widespread price increases were reported by Richmond and a leveling   off of housing prices was reported by San Francisco. Lower farm   commodity prices were reported by a number of Districts.   Nevertheless, generally upward price pressures were reported by   Chicago, and sharply higher construction materials prices were   reported by St. Louis and Kansas City.
The financial sector is characterized by relatively high demand for   consumer and farm loans, but sluggish demand for business loans.   High or rising demand for consumer loans was reported by   Philadelphia, Richmond, and San Francisco. Chicago, Minneapolis, and   Kansas City report farm loan demand to be exceptionally strong.   Strong real estate loan demand was reported by Richmond. While most   of the Districts report that business loan demand remains relatively   weak, there are indications that such demand is beginning to pick   up. Boston reported some rise in industrial loan demand. Richmond   noted some increased demand for loans by wholesalers and retailers.   Sluggish business loan demand in New York has prompted several banks   to seek out medium-sized regional borrowing customers. Some flew   York banks have already established out-of-state loan production   offices and others are contemplating similar action. Some moderation   in the rate of savings growth was indicated by reports from   Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and parts of the   Dallas District. Kansas City, however, reported strong deposit and   loan growth.
No upsurge in interest rates is expected. Philadelphia reported that   the prime rate was expected to move up to about the 7-7-1/4 range   by the end of the year.
Overall prospects for crop yields and production this year are   generally good. An abundance of grain and lower cost livestock feed   is in prospect for the year ahead. These developments point to   rising supplies of livestock products. Drought has had some adverse   impact on crop prospects in parts of the Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago,   and San Francisco Districts, but recent rains have improved the   outlook for crops. Of great concern to the farm sector, however, is   the decline in prices of major farm commodities and the impact on   farm incomes. The generally unfavorable farm income outlook was   expressed by Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis,   Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The lower farm commodity   prices, especially grains, are already having an unfavorable impact   on bank credit conditions in rural communities in a number of the   Districts. Chicago reported that deposit growth in agricultural area   banks has slowed, that loan demand is exceptionally strong, and   loan-to-deposit ratios are above desired levels. Kansas City   reported some serious farm cash flow problems.
