The Columbia River flow is now at 68 percent of normal and will probably fall below that. The Bonneville Power Administration has already cut off interruptible power to aluminum and chemical plants. (These plants depend about 25 percent on interruptible power.) In Oregon, the Trojan nuclear plant came on stream and in December it was operating at 95 percent of capacity and carrying 40 percent of Portland General Electric's load. The fuel cost was about one- seventh of what it would have been using oil- fired generating facilities. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. of California has a nuclear plant that is finished, but operations will be delayed another 6 to 9 months by the regulatory commission. One Director states that there is a heavy inventory of No. 5, No. 6 and No. 2 heating oils, substitutes for natural gas, but there is difficulty getting it to the needy areas. California utilities have reversed inflow on the El Paso line and are sending natural gas to Texas. Exploration for natural gas will not pick up, according to one Director, until controls on inter-state pricing are removed. Currently, the intra-state producer is getting about $1.55 per cubic foot whereas the inter-state producer is getting about $.52 per cubic foot. Agriculture
Plans for water allocations to farm and residential areas are underway in most states. During the past season available water was used in California's Central Valley for cotton rather than for alfalfa. This will make feed grain for cattle exceptionally scarce and cattlemen are now reducing herds. Prices for agricultural commodities are expected to increase sharply this year. So far, however, crops are still in a state of overproduction and farm income continues low. Industries
The skiing industry was a total disaster this year and many businesses will probably go under causing problems for bankers. The only industry to wring some good out of the current drought is forest products where the weather has allowed logging operations to continue through the winter. Even here, however, the low rainfall is having unfavorable consequences in that the Northwest had a forest fire in January, an unheard of event before this year.
