In the opinion of our Directors, the recovery has been strengthening   on a broad front, but there is great concern over the economic   implications of the low rainfall in the West and low temperatures in   the East. In most non-agricultural areas of the District, consumer   spending exceeded expectations in December and into January. The   recovery in housing is proceeding at a rapid rate and early signs of   a pickup in nonresidential construction have been reported. The low   rainfall and snowpack in the West will curtail hydro-electric power   output. The Bonneville Power Administration has already stopped the   flow of interruptible power to aluminum and chemical plants in the   Northwest. The forest products industry has benefited from the   extension of their logging season, but the dry weather has   heightened the danger of forest fires. Plans for limiting irrigation   water to agricultural areas are underway in many District states.
Most areas of the District report record December retail sales and a   continuation of the trend into January. The exception is   agricultural areas where lower incomes have dampened consumer   spending. Along the Pacific seaboard and other areas where the   housing boom has been gathering strength for a year, sales of   furniture, appliances and carpeting are very strong. Current sales   gains for new cars are ranging 12 to 60 percent over last year.   Large cars, pick-ups and vans continue to be popular while smaller   car sales lag expectations.
The construction industry is expanding at a very rapid rate. Housing   starts are up 30 to 50 percent over last year in many areas. Because   of the cost of land, lead time required and interest on property   during the development stage, builders claim there is no low cost   housing, that the cheapest house would cost $40,000 to $45,000 to   produce. As a result, they believe that the stage is set for a "rather dramatic shift to multi-unit housing" that will be evident   within the next 4 to 5 months.
Moreover, a turnaround is occurring in nonresidential construction. "Major plants are being planned and the plants are going to go   ahead. It is a good market for building. There are no shortages and   you can get quality workers." Complaints are made, however, that   environmental requirements and the demands of City Councils often   hold up a project for a year to eighteen months. The renewed   interest in plant and equipment spending is reflected in growing   backlogs at steel plants and the shift in the composition of demand   to more plate and structural forms.
Many of our Directors commented on the economic effects of the   current drought in the West and freezing conditions elsewhere in the   country. The following areas of special concern were discussed.
