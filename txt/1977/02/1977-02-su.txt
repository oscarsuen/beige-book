Weather dominated the news in most Districts' reports. Cold weather   drained natural gas supplies and resulted in widespread layoffs in   some Districts, especially Atlanta, Philadelphia, Cleveland,   Chicago, and New York and extensive crop damage in Florida.   Nevertheless, the overall opinion seems to be that the economy shows   signs of strengthening and losses in output and employment will be   made up later in the year. Retail sales were particularly strong in   several areas not affected by the weather, such as San Francisco and   Boston, and also held up in Chicago and St. Louis despite severe   weather. Housing activity shows signs of accelerating. Prices for   manufactured goods are likely to be under upward pressures because   of the high cost of alternate fuels and alternate transportation,   and prices for fruits and vegetables are also expected to   accelerate. Savings flows remain generally strong and rates paid on   deposits are easing in some Districts.
Natural gas and fuel shortages apparently have their greatest   effects on output and employment in Atlanta, Philadelphia,   Cleveland, Chicago, and New York. An estimated 250,000 to 335,000   layoffs have resulted from fuel shortages in the Atlanta District.   Approximately 175,000 workers were laid off in the Philadelphia   District as a result of curtailments of natural gas and weather-  related problems. Cleveland estimates that about 110,000   manufacturing workers were laid off as of early February,   principally in steel, automotive, glass, and metal fabricating   plants. Chicago notes that the most serious impact has been on steel   plants in Indiana, where over 40,000 workers were laid off early in   February. Automotive assembly plants in Michigan had layoffs because   of parts shortages. Chicago and Cleveland said that many   manufacturers have switched to alternate fuels, but deliveries have   been slowed by frozen waterways and lack of carriers. As these   deliveries have improved, many laid off workers have been recalled.   New York also notes cutbacks in output and employment, especially in   Buffalo and Rochester.
Slight to moderate effects of fuel shortages were noted in Richmond   and St. Louis, but other Districts, including Boston, Minneapolis,   and Dallas, were relatively unaffected either because alternate fuel   supplies have been available or weather conditions have not been   abnormal.
Despite widespread effects of fuel shortages and abnormal   conditions, the tone of District reports still seems to indicate   that losses in output and employment will eventually be recovered   and economic activity will continue to strengthen. New York remarks   that "business economists viewed the decline in production and   employment as a temporary disruption," and Cleveland points out   economists who met at that Bank on February 3 expect the expansion   to continue through 1977 despite constraints on fuel supplies. The   latest surveys by the Philadelphia and Richmond Banks indicate that   respondents expect continued improvement in economic activity at   least through the first half of 1977.
Consumer spending has been notably strong in some Districts, but   fell sharply in some others especially in the last few weeks of the   cold weather period. Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco   note that retail sales in the last 2 months were strong; but New   York and Philadelphia comment that sales in the last 2 weeks of   January and early February fell sharply, apparently in response to   severe weather. Retailers, although optimistic, are concerned over   effects of high fuel bills on discretionary spending.
Construction activity, especially housing, appears to show signs of   accelerating. Substantial strength in housing starts is noted in   Dallas and San Francisco. Forecasts of housing starts in the Chicago   District have been increased because of the large volume of funds   available from savings and loan associations and life insurance   companies. Dallas remarks that one homebuilder plans to boost starts   by a fourth this year in Dallas, Ft. Worth, and Houston. Starts in   several areas of the San Francisco District have increased 30 to 50   percent from last year. Both Dallas and Atlanta report mobile home   sales have strengthened. Similarly, signs of revival in multi-family   construction are noted in the southwest and west coast areas.   Shortages of building materials, including lumber, brick, cement,   plastic pipe, wallboard, and insulation, may develop this year   according to Chicago and Dallas.
Adverse weather conditions in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San   Francisco have caused extensive damage to crops and concern over   future prospects for agriculture in those Districts. Florida's   fruit, sugar cane, and vegetable crops, except celery and lettuce,   have been severely damaged by freezing weather. Citrus fruit losses   are estimated between 25 and 35 percent of the unharvested crop.   Last year's drought and lack of moisture caused considerable concern   to farmers and bankers in the Minneapolis District. Low farm   commodities prices and low production in drought-stricken areas are   cutting farm spending. The need for refinancing appears to have   increased, but bankers are concerned about the ability of farmers to   continue payments even on existing loans. Lack of rainfall in the   west is curtailing hydro-electric power output. According to San   Francisco, the Bonneville Power Administration has stopped the flow   of interruptible power to aluminum and chemical plants in the   northwest and plans for allocating water to farm and residential   areas are underway in most States. Agriculture prices will   apparently be under upward price pressures because of adverse   weather conditions. Sharp increases in prices for agricultural   commodities this year are expected by San Francisco, and Atlanta   points out that vegetable, citrus crops, and livestock prices are   likely to increase as a result of a severe freeze in Florida.   However, ample supplies of red meat and pork should hold down   increases in overall food prices, at least for the first half of   1977 according to Kansas City. Large beef supplies in the first half   are likely to be followed by smaller supplies and higher prices in   the second half of 1977. Upward price pressures on industrial   commodities are likely to intensify because of higher costs of   alternate fuel oil and higher costs of alternate modes of   transportation.
Business loan demand remains generally sluggish in Districts that   commented. However, a considerable pickup in credit demand from oil   distributors to finance inventories is noted in Philadelphia, and   Kansas City notes strong loan demand by coal mining and oil drilling   firms. Easing in rates paid on time and savings deposits and on   saving certificates has occurred in Dallas and St. Louis; but some   thrift institutions in Cleveland, which only last month reduced   rates on passbook savings accounts and on certificates, raised rates   because of loss of deposits.
