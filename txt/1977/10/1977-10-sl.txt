Slowing in the rate of growth of some aspects of economic activity in the Eighth Federal Reserve District has occurred since the first half of the year. Businessmen generally remain optimistic, however, and few expect a further decline in the rate of expansion. Growth of consumer spending continues unabated. Business inventories are reported to be in line with sales. While growth of business loans at large banks remains slow, overall demand for credit continues to expand. Manufacturing and construction activities continue to expand moderately. Wet weather during the past week has slowed crop harvesting in parts of the District, but harvesting is still ahead of a year ago, and most crops are expected to be larger.
Consumer spending has increased somewhat in recent weeks from a mid-summer slump according to major retail store representatives. One   representative in the St. Louis area reported rising sales for big   ticket items, such as furniture and appliances. Retail sales were   reported to be excellent in Little Rock as well as other parts of   the District. Furthermore, most of the retail respondents remain   cautiously optimistic as to sales in the fourth quarter.
All respondents report that inventories are being watched closely   and that no excesses are present. The department stores reported   some excesses in soft goods during the summer months as a result of   smaller-than-expected sales, but in recent weeks these excesses have   been worked off to desired levels. Builders generally report that no   homes are being built except on order. Also, in the Memphis area the   excesses of condominiums built up in the previous recession have   been largely worked off.
Loan demand generally continues moderately upward. Outside the major   cities loan demand is reported to be strong in all sectors of the   economy. In the larger cities, however, the rising demand is   generally limited to real estate and consumer loans, with commercial   and industrial loan demand remaining weak. Savings and loan   associations report continued strong savings inflows; however,   savings deposits at the large commercial banks in the District have   declined. Interest rates on real estate loans remain stable at about   8-3/4 percent. Rates on most other loans, however, have inched up   along with the rates on other market instruments.
Production in the major industries of the District continues to   expand but generally at a slower rate than in the first half of the   year. In the manufacturing sector, major chemical firms reported   slower growth in August and September than earlier in the year but   did not consider this as a serious weakness. Manufacturers of   textiles, fibers, boxboards, automobiles, apparel and construction   materials generally report a more moderate uptrend in orders and   production.
Construction of single-family homes remains at a high level   throughout the District. Such construction in the St. Louis area is   reported to be at the highest level in twenty years. The occupancy   rate is relatively high in multi-family units, but construction   remains relatively weak, especially in the St. Louis area.   Commercial construction remains weak, but an increasing number of   small projects is reported.
