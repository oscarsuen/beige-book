Economic activity here is generally quite strong and is expected to remain so. Directors report widespread business expansion and are optimistic: they see few capacity or materials problems, wage increases have not been large enough to lead to production adjustments, and firms have increased capital spending. As a result of this business strength, consumers have been spending more, and retailers expect good sales to continue. The district's two major weak spots are still the iron ore workers' strike and farmers' poor income prospects. Loans to farmers, consumers, and businesses have increased faster than deposits at district banks, thus tightening their liquidity positions.
Directors see signs that this current strength will continue. They   see few capacity constraints or material shortages which could limit   business activity, and they don't think any recent wage increases   have been large enough to reduce it. They also report that district   manufacturers are still increasing their plant and equipment   spending, which indicates planned expansion. A director who sells   control devices for industrial plants says his firm's orders have   been rising steadily. Another reports increased capital outlays in   the food industry. Spending for energy development in Montana and   North Dakota is expected to be substantial too.
Most retailers expect consumer spending to remain strong. Some are   concerned about shortages—of insulation, for example—resulting   from the recent good sales. But they are generally satisfied with   current inventory levels.
The strike of about 18,000 iron ore workers has been depressing   economic activity in northeastern Minnesota and Upper Michigan since   August 1. According to recent press reports, the chance of a   settlement soon are small.
Income prospects remain small too, for both livestock and crop   farmers in the district. Although cattle prices have increased some   recently, they are still not high enough to make cow/calf operations   profitable. Cattle feeders may be somewhat better off because of the   very low costs of grain. But grain farmers' income is likely to   suffer from those low prices plus lower yields than previously   expected. Insects have been infesting corn crops and rains have been   delaying harvesting recently, especially in North Dakota.
One director sees rain as a source of possible relief for ag income,   though. Since Canada's wheat yields have also been reduced by rain,   and since Russia may need to import more wheat than expected, our   grain exports and prices may increase modestly.
