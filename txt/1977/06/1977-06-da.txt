Most economic barometers of business activity indicate that the economic recovery in the Eleventh District is still moving forward at a steady pace. Department store sales remain strong, and an increase in small-car purchases is adding to total unit sales. Manufacturing output and drilling activity in Texas continue to register gains, but some delivery and work schedules are beginning to stretch out. Although total employment remains essentially unchanged, some shortages of skilled labor are cropping up. There is no evidence of speculative buying in Texas in the markets for new homes or agricultural land.
Department store sales are running about 14 percent above year-earlier levels. Durable goods are selling well—especially home   furnishings. Retailers also report an improvement in sales of   women's apparel and accessories. Department store inventories are   generally at desired levels, and retailers remain optimistic that   sales will continue to grow steadily for the remainder of the year.
While the current strength in automobile sales is in the large- and   intermediate-sized models dealers report a quickening in small-car   sales and a definite trend back to smaller cars since President   Carter's energy message. Vans and light trucks continue to sell   briskly but used car sales have weakened in some major urban   markets. New car inventories are lower than desirable for the more   popular models, and their limited availability is holding down unit   sales.
Manufacturing in Texas continues to show moderate gains, and much of   the strength in output is being spurred by demand for construction   materials. Production of construction steel products is up   substantially, and demand for cement is unusually strong. Producers   of lumber mill products think that rising lumber prices may soften   later this year due to a runup in lumber inventories. Production of   oil field equipment is running near full capacity, and a backlog of   unfilled orders for drilling equipment is beginning to rise.   Delivery times for some rig components and specialty tools are   lengthening.
Increased drilling activity in Texas accounts for the strength in   mining output, as oil and gas production continues to decline.   Drilling contractors have a solid backlog of contracts with drilling   costs running 10 percent to 25 percent higher than a year ago. Short   supplies of new and used drill pipe and tool joints, coupled with   longer lead times for other rig components, are forcing adjustments   in many drilling operations. Older equipment, for example, is being   pressed into active service. Although contractors report no serious   labor shortages, the availability of experienced crews is gradually   declining.
Despite little change in total employment in the District, some   shortages of skilled labor are appearing in jobs requiring   machinists, mechanics, building tradesmen, nurses, and secretaries.   The job outlook is good for college students seeking summer   employment in construction-related industries.
The housing market in Texas remains robust, but there is no evidence   to suggest that speculation has taken hold. The supply of new homes   generally continues to grow in line with demand. Developers in   Houston indicate that some projects are being held back by delays in   public utility hookups and street construction. Second mortgages in   Texas are not playing a significant role in the strong housing   market because a homestead statute restricts such loans to home   improvements.
Agricultural land values in the District have increased only   slightly in the past year. A recent survey of agribankers' opinions   as to changes in average land values over the preceding 12 months   indicated that dryland and irrigated cropland rose about 2.5 percent   to 3.5 percent, while ranchland declined about 3 percent. Areas in   the District where cotton and soybeans are dominant crops showed a   higher appreciation in land values—particularly the southern High   Plains and Rolling Plains of Texas, South Texas, and northern   Louisiana. Low grain prices tempered increases in land values   somewhat in many areas. And ranchland values were stagnated by   depressed cash flows and reduced income from cattle operations.   However, more than a fourth of the bankers surveyed felt land values   will rise this year.
Mortgage financing continues to be covered by the conventional   sources of credit—individuals, Federal land banks, and insurance   companies. However, several real estate agents report some influx of   out-of-state and foreign capital that has been used directly to   purchase tracts of land.
