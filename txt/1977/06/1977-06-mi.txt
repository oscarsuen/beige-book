Directors report that district business activity is expanding. Consumer spending has been quite good. Recent rains have eased concerns about the drought. District manufacturing activity is advancing. Uncertainty about the Administration's energy program, though, could curb some capital spending. Recent increases in loan demand at district commercial banks reflect an improving district economy. Residential real estate values in the district are much higher than a year ago, and district homebuilding activity is very strong.
Comments from this district's reserve bank directors are mostly   favorable. Several directors report that consumer spending has been   quite strong in their areas. South Dakota looks for record tourist   spending this year. Also, recent rains have helped ease concern   about further effects of the drought in eastern Montana and North   Dakota, although very dry weather still persists in western Montana.   Water supplies there may not be enough to generate the hydroelectric   power needed for this summer. And directors say that the prospect of   low grain prices is still a concern in some areas.
District manufacturing activity remains quite strong. Manufacturers   responding to our second quarter Industrial Expectations Survey   foresee year-over-year sales increases of about 15 percent in the   first half of 1977. Sales increases during this period are expected   to be up around 17 percent for durable goods and 11 percent for   nondurables. District manufacturing employment recently has been   increasing quite briskly in response to this favorable sales   activity. However, most respondents to this survey view their   inventories and plant and equipment to be about right in light of   expected sales activity.
The Administration s energy program may have affected some capital   spending plans. A director whose firm sells control devices used in   industrial plants and another who is closely associated with the   food industry share similar views. They both indicate that   uncertainties about the proposed energy program have delayed some   capital spending plans not only in the district but also in the   nation. Many directors, however, feel that the President's energy   program would have little immediate effect on district farmers and   small businesses.
Loan demand has been quite strong throughout most of the district.   Some directors point out that mortgage and consumer lending have   been somewhat stronger than commercial lending. In the areas that   don't depend on agriculture, rising business activity is the   greatest cause of improved loan demand. In ag-related regions, loan   growth stems in part from farmers having to refinance existing debt.   However, a North Dakota director reports that recent rains have   helped boost loan demand in his area by improving the local   economy's prospects.
Residential real estate values are climbing rapidly throughout the   district. The Minneapolis-St. Paul area real estate market is   described as "hot." One large savings and loan estimates that home   prices are up about 15 percent from a year ago. In Sioux Falls and   Rapid City, South Dakota, a director reports, residential real   estate prices are up 25 percent from a year ago. And our director   from North Dakota describes residential land prices there as "unbelievable." A strong demand for housing as well as increasing   costs seem to be the main reasons for these large price increases.   With this strong demand for housing, a Minneapolis-St. Paul   commercial bank reports that large homebuilders here are looking for   a "super" year.
Nonresidential property values are also increasing. Agricultural   land values are up throughout most of the district. Land values   along the Canadian border of Montana have been increasing very   rapidly. Several directors report some speculative buying of real   estate, but nothing approaching the high level of speculative   activity on the West Coast. Finally, our directors are not aware of   any district banks and savings and loan associations making second   mortgages for the purpose of acquiring additional real estate.
