The district's midyear economic situation is quite hopeful, except in the agricultural sector. Retail sales growth recently slowed, but autos are selling well and merchants are looking for a good autumn. Homebuilding is strong. Tourism is excellent. And unemployment has been falling. But, despite better moisture conditions, worries about low ag prices make agricultural conditions a concern. The current expansion in the nonfarm sector and refinancing in the farm sector have boosted loan growth. The strength in loan demand, along with a slowing in deposit inflows, has resulted in some declines in liquidity.
A late June survey of district automobile distributors shows   recently strong auto sales. Major manufacturers are enjoying sales   gains of 10 percent or more above last year's May-June period.
Homebuilding is strong. District housing unit building permit   authorizations (at a seasonally adjusted annual rate) so far in 1977   have risen well above 1972's record level. Single-family units make   up much of the renewed growth in housing activity. With the current   high level of loan commitments at S&Ls, strength in this market   should continue. A significant pickup in the multiunit market over   the near term is not likely. Additionally, district nonbuilding and   nonresidential construction have improved this year.
Despite this rather bright outlook, capacity constraints could curb   further increases in homebuilding. Carpenters are in very short   supply in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The demand is also strong   for roofers, plumbers, electricians, and bricklayers.
The region is enjoying a good tourist season. Minnesota and   Wisconsin resorts, full over the July 4 weekend, expect business to   remain excellent through July and August.
The agricultural situation is not nearly as encouraging. Prices,   rather than drought, are the main concern. Moisture conditions are   ample in most of Minnesota and South Dakota. Some dry areas remain   in Montana and North Dakota. The weather's dramatic turnaround is   maturing crops two to three weeks faster than normal. But prospects   of abundant crops and large carryovers will likely exert more   downward pressures on grain prices. Feeder and slaughter cattle   prices remain at unprofitably low levels too. Hog prices, however,   have increased in recent months and should remain profitable through   the summer.
As in the nation, time and savings deposit inflows have recently   slowed at district S&Ls and banks. Consequently, liquidity positions   at district financial institutions have tightened, but no immediate   problems meeting the district's credit demands are expected as a   result.
