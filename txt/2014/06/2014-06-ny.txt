Economic activity in the Second District has continued to grow at a moderate pace since the last report. Prices of finished goods and services remained generally stable, and businesses report modest upward pressure on input prices. Manufacturers report that business activity has picked up considerably in recent weeks, while service sector firms indicate a mixed performance. Labor market conditions have shown signs of firming across a broad range of industries, with scattered reports of labor shortages. Both general merchandise retailers and auto dealers report that sales have been steady to stronger since the last report. Tourism activity has strengthened, no longer held back by harsh weather. Housing markets showed further signs of improvement, while commercial real estate markets were generally steady. Finally, banks report fairly widespread increases in demand for loans--especially mortgages; credit standards are little changed, while delinquency rates are steady to down modestly.
Auto dealers in upstate New York report that new vehicle sales continued to be strong in April and early May, while used car sales have been mixed. Rochester-area dealers indicate further strengthening, with April new vehicle sales up 17 percent from comparable 2013 levels and May sales comparably strong; used car sales are also seen as fairly robust. Buffalo-area dealers report more moderate gains of 5 percent from a year ago in new vehicle sales but also characterize them as strong; used vehicle sales, however, are described as somewhat soft.
Tourism activity has strengthened since the last report, in part reflecting improved weather. Both revenues and attendance at Broadway theaters picked up markedly in April and remained solid into early May, running roughly 20 percent ahead of comparable 2013 levels--partly driven by an increase in the number of shows. The average ticket price has remained roughly on par with a year ago. New York City hotels report that revenues picked up modestly in April but appear to be strengthening noticeably in May, with occupancy rates running well above 90 percent and room rates up 3-4 percent from a year ago. This understates the number of stays, as the inventory of hotel rooms has also increased over the past year. Hotel occupancy rates also strengthened in parts of upstate New York in April.
New York City's sales market remains robust--particularly in the outer boroughs. While sales volume has not kept pace with elevated 2013 levels, one contact surmises that the weather may have pushed the peak spring season back a couple months. A major appraisal firm reports that prices of Manhattan co-ops and condos have risen moderately this year and are now nearly back to their peak levels of 2008; this contact also notes that nearly half of all residential (apartment) sales have been all-cash deals, in part from foreign buyers. Selling prices for Brooklyn and Queens apartments continue to rise briskly. Manhattan's rental market, which had been flat, has shown signs of a modest pickup in recent months, while strong demand continues to drive up rents in Brooklyn and Queens. The inventory of available condos and co-ops across the city remains lean, except at the high end of Manhattan's market, where there has been a good deal of new development.
Commercial real estate markets have been mixed but generally stable during the spring. Office availability rates remained elevated in the Westchester/Fairfield market and especially in northern New Jersey, but continued to edge lower in the New York City, Long Island and Westchester/Fairfield markets; in upstate New York, they rose modestly. Industrial availability rates have continued to edge down across most of the District.
Manufacturing firms in the District report widespread increases in activity since the last report, whereas service-sector firms overall report a mixed performance. Price pressures in the manufacturing sector remain subdued; in the service sector they are more widespread but also subdued. In general, business contacts plan to hike their selling prices modestly in the year ahead.
