Aggregate business activity in the Third District grew at a modest pace during this current Beige Book period. Most sectors resumed the pace of activity that was evident before the recent winter disruptions. Auto sales surged with "phenomenal" growth in April -- rebounding yet further from the winter slump, while general retail sales resumed a modest pace of growth. Demand for general services maintained a moderate pace of growth over the Beige Book period, and staffing services continued to maintain a modest pace. After partially rebounding in the previous Beige Book period, the residential construction and real estate sectors posted slight declines in contracts for new homes and sales of existing homes. Noncommercial real estate fared better: Construction maintained slight growth with several large groundbreakings yet to come, and contacts noted a slight uptick in activity for office leasing. Manufacturers reported a modest increase in activity. Tourist destinations reported slight growth during this shoulder season between snow and sun. Lending volumes continued to grow slightly over this period, and credit quality continued to improve. Overall, contacts reported slight increases in wages, home prices, and general price levels, similar to the last Beige Book period.
Overall, contacts anticipated moderate growth over the next six months and continued to express confidence in the underlying economy. With regard to hiring and capital expenditure plans, firms are beginning to increase capital expenditures, especially to boost efficiency; some new hiring is occurring, but firms remain cautious.
Optimism among Third District manufacturers that business conditions will improve during the next six months has held steady since the last Beige Book and was evident across nearly all sectors. More than one-half of all firms anticipated increases in activity over the next six months; only about 15 percent reported expectations of lower activity. Nearly one-third of the firms reported that they anticipate higher levels of employment and capital expenditures in six months -- slightly less than during the last Beige Book period.
Auto sales surged further during this Beige Book period, rebounding further from the weak sales posted in the first two months of the year. Dealers reported "phenomenal" sales in April following a strong month in March. Auto dealers remain bullish for the remainder of 2014.
Nonresidential real estate contacts reported little change in the relatively low level of construction; however, some activity for surveying and inspections has fully returned to normal since the earlier winter disruptions. Some developers continue to build and lease industrial/warehouse space on a speculative basis, as demand remains strong in this market. Most other markets require signed contracts. One contact noted a small uptick in leasing activity for office space since the last Beige Book. Most contacts describe activity as slow and steady. They remain optimistic that construction activity will accelerate somewhat, as several large projects are breaking ground this year.
Tourism destinations maintained slight growth during the shoulder season between winter ski and summer shore activity. The prolonged winter weather was reported to have helped the ski resorts. Now it is reported to have also increased cabin fever and demand for summer getaways along the shore. Contacts from Delaware and New Jersey shore communities reported increases in early bookings for the 2014 season. Increased demand for hotel rooms in Delaware's coastal county has outpaced the increased supply since last year. New Jersey contacts reported that there is greater preparedness to welcome tourists this year than last following Hurricane Sandy. In addition, some boat owners are bringing their boats back to the shore following recession belt-tightening.
