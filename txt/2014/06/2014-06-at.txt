On balance, reports on retail activity were mixed; however, auto dealers reported positive sales growth for the period. The tourism sector remained a bright spot with an increase in the number of domestic and international visitors to the District. According to residential real estate contacts, new and existing home sales were up and home prices continued to appreciate compared to a year ago.

Purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector cited continued growth in new orders and production. According to bankers, loan demand for most types of loans was up across most parts of the region. District firms added to payrolls, albeit at a modest pace. Labor and material cost pressures remained stable and businesses continued to operate under tight margins.
Contacts from the District's tourism and hospitality sector expressed an overall exuberance regarding activity. The number of visitors, especially international travelers from Latin America and Europe, to New Orleans, Atlanta, and most parts of Florida, increased. The near term outlook among contacts remains positive with most expecting an increase in travel compared with a year earlier.
Reports on current conditions from District builders were also more positive than the previous report. Most contacts reported that recent activity either met or exceeded their plan for the period. The majority of builders reported that construction activity and new home sales were ahead of the year earlier level. Reports on the level of unsold inventory were somewhat mixed. The majority of contacts continued to report modest home price appreciation. The outlook among builders for new home sales and construction activity was somewhat less optimistic than the previous report.
Commercial builders and brokers indicated that demand for commercial real estate continued to improve. Absorption picked up, though contacts continued to remind us that the rate of improvement varies by metropolitan area, submarket, and property type. Construction activity continued to increase at a modest pace from last year; most contacts reported that their current backlog is ahead of year earlier levels. Contacts indicated that apartment construction remains fairly strong and the level of construction activity across other property types has remained steady. The outlook among District commercial real estate contacts remained positive with continued improvement expected over the course of the year.
Transportation contacts continued to cite expanding activity in April and May. District ports reported significant increases in exports of energy-related products; record unit volumes of cars, trucks, and tractors; and double-digit growth in containerized cargo. Railroads saw considerable increases in the movement of petroleum products and heavy equipment, as well as continued expansion in intermodal traffic. Trucking companies reported a slowing in the growth of tonnage since the last report but overall freight volumes remained robust. The majority of transportation contacts expect growth to be sustained for the rest of the year.
Most contacts reported relatively stable labor and material cost pressures. Notable exceptions included reports of greater wage pressure for some high-skilled positions and greater cost increases for food, transportation, and some construction materials. Unit costs are expected to increase 1.9 percent over the next 12 months, according to the Atlanta Fed's survey on business inflation expectations. Overall, profit margins were tight across most industries. However, a growing number of contacts communicated an expectation that the need to widen margins could have an upward influence on prices over the coming year.
Parts of the District saw excessive rain, with flooding reported in lower Alabama and the Florida panhandle. There were some reports of crop damage and delayed planting attributed to excessive moisture.
