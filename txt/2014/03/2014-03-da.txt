Prices Most responding firms said prices were stable to up slightly over the reporting period. There were a few instances of accelerating prices.

Natural gas prices rose marginally over the course of the last six weeks, peaking at $7.63 in early February and ending the reporting period at $5.35. This was driven by the exceptionally cold winter, which led to a drawdown of inventories to the bottom of its 5-year range. The price of WTI also rose over the last six weeks, trading as high as $100.35 at the end of the period. This price behavior was driven in part by heating oil demand, which has also been bolstered by the severe winter, and debottlenecking at Cushing, OK.

Cotton prices have rallied since December, which may lead more farmers to favor cotton over other row crops when making planting decisions this spring.
