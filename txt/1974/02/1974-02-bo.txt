According to our directors, business conditions vary widely from continuing strength to considerable weakness. Materials shortages are widespread and are creating production bottlenecks. Concern that materials will be unavailable when needed has led to inventory accumulation, according to bank directors.
New orders are reported as very strong in machinery and equipment manufacturing, especially items dealing with oil exploration. Ship-building orders are also heavy because of the need to build new types of tankers to transport liquefied natural gas. One director commented that "business is better than the headlines."
Material shortages were mentioned by all the directors. One director commented that "anything you want takes extra time and effort to get". This director reports that purchasing agents have to look all over the world for even minor items in order to keep production going. Steel products—tubular pipes for oil drilling and sheet plates for ships—were among the many items cited as in short supply. Aluminum, metals, castings, plastics and semi-manufactured parts were also reported as being part of the "amazing conglomeration of shortages." As a result of the shortages, several directors reported that firms are building larger than needed inventories to keep a hedge on needed materials. Hoarding of raw materials is especially evident in imported goods,
One director noted that when price controls are lifted, the shortages disappear. He cited that resins had been unavailable from domestic sources at the controlled price (and were being bought previously in Mexico with their Ohio labeling still on them), but in the one week since resins have been decontrolled, they have become readily available—at twice their previous price. Other directors also expressed the belief that materials shortages have been created by producers who are either shipping goods abroad in order to import them at decontrolled prices or are diverting supplies to get them into the most expensive channels. The oil industry was mentioned as an example of the latter machinations.
Small business firms were particularly singled out as being hurt by these shortages. One director expects unemployment rates to rise to well over 10 percent in those areas of Connecticut where small manufacturing firms predominate. Gasoline shortages, he noted, will make labor mobility more difficult from the high unemployment areas. Unemployment rates rose in December in all the New England states, climbing to 7.3 percent (seasonally adjusted) in Massachusetts. A director from a Connecticut telephone company mentioned that due to the low level of residential and commercial construction in Connecticut, the company is considering going on a shorter workweek at the end of March, for the first time since the 1930s.
Another area of weakness is the recreational area. Ski areas have been hurt by lack of snow and the scare over gasoline shortages, although gasoline is reported as available in ski country. Manufacturers of recreational vehicles have also been hurt. Camper business is reported as "limping" by one director and the motor boat business is also slow, although sailboat sales are reported as "fantastic." General aviation aircraft backlogs were being reduced, one director noted.
