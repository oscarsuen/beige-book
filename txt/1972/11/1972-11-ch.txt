Business sentiment has improved further in the past month. Labor markets are tightening; retail trade is strong; order backlogs are building in many industries and lead times on new orders are lengthening. The upswing in capital goods appears to be gathering steam and is spreading to a broader base. More firms are planning on the general business expansion to continue quarter-by-quarter through 1973, with no significant slowdown in the second half. Soybean and possibly corn harvests will be reduced by adverse weather conditions.
More firms are finding skilled workers in short supply and shortages of suitable trainees are reported. Labor turnover and absenteeism rates have increased, but remain below the high rates of the late 1960s. A larger volume of want ads and a steady reduction in claims for unemployment compensation also suggest a stronger demand for workers. Nevertheless, unions in some sectors, e.g., building trades and trucking, are not pressing for large settlements. They fear further losses of jobs to nonunion operators.
Retailers are pleased with recent sales levels, especially of seasonal merchandise, such as apparel and sporting goods. Color television output schedules have been increased again. Output of some household appliances was reduced in September and October, but sales since then have been somewhat in excess of expectations and inventories have declined.
Trucks continue to lead the general expansion in capital goods. Producers of engines and rear axles for heavy trucks are working three shifts a day, seven days a week. Capacity restraints are limiting sales of most types of trucks. Some orders are being booked for delivery next March and April. Most truck producers are in the midst of programs to expand production.
Order backlogs are building for a variety of capital goods. Some producers of components are reporting new orders up 30 or 40 percent from last year, although an improvement was already under way at this   time in 1971. Demand for hydraulic excavators, concrete mixers and environmental control systems is especially strong. Recently, orders for overhead cranes, usually associated with major new plants, have increased from a sluggish pace.
Order backlogs of one steel firm are the highest on record, in tonnage terms, except for strike-hedge buildup periods. Lead times are lengthening for steel. The improvement in demand now includes all major product lines. Steel shipments are forecast at 96 million tons for 1973, up from 92 million tons in 1972. Output of some products may be close to capacity.
Significant stretchouts in order lead times are reported for such items as plastic molds, metal fasteners and bearings. Producers of these items do not now have the effective capacity to achieve levels of output reached in the late 1960s. They must expand staff and add facilities.
