Factory employment rebounded slightly in August in many parts of the District. Manufacturing employment in Ohio was up 11,000 from July, signaling the first solid gains in the state's manufacturing employment since February. Most of the increase came in the durable-goods industries. For instance, the Youngstown-Warren area, which over the last year lost 4,000 manufacturing jobs, saw a healthy increase of 2,000 factory workers, as a substantial number of transportation equipment workers were recalled.
Employment prospects for the fourth quarter are generally favorable throughout the District. Employment gains in wholesale and retail are expected to exceed those of other industries. However, both durable and nondurable manufacturers appear much more positive about hiring additional workers than in comparable periods of the past two years.
Average weekly earnings also increased in August primarily due to an increase in the workweek. In Ohio and Pittsburgh, the average workweek lengthened by one-half hour to 42.5 hours.
The Purchasing Managers survey supports this outlook by reporting an increase in production and new orders. In addition, a backlog of orders and a reduction in inventories has put upward pressure on commodity prices. The Cincinnati survey reports that increases in commodity prices are the highest since the survey began in 1982. Purchasers in the area report problems with late deliveries and a shortage of some paper and steel products. A similar, though less dramatic, situation is reported for Northeast Ohio.
Steel shipments from Ohio's mills increased by less than 1 percent in August over July, compared with a 2.3 percent increase nationwide. However, shipments in the Pittsburgh area increased 15 percent between July and September as USX continued to increase output after its six-month work stoppage.
