Economic activity appears to be picking up in the First District. Retailers are quite upbeat about their recent sales results. Most of those contacted show double-digit percentage increases in September compared to a year earlier. However, the tight labor market in New England is creating cost pressures for retailers as wages rise and hiring difficulties cause delays. In manufacturing, most respondents have also experienced recent gains in orders and sales. Despite rising costs for some raw materials and imported inputs, most manufacturers are holding the line on their own sales prices. Manufacturers and retailers are both moderately optimistic about the remainder of the year and 1988. Many foresee continuing cost pressures but no real upsurge in inflation.
Inventories are generally in line with plans, mostly higher than last year to support increased sales. One chain reported selected inventories below plan because of difficulties obtaining consumer electronics merchandise from "over-cautious" manufacturers who were stung by slow sales in the spring.
Hiring difficulties are an important source of concern among First District retailers. High-quality applicants to fill all job categories are in short supply despite wage increases. Some convenience stores have intermittently curtailed hours for lack of help, and some chains have had to postpone opening new stores because of hiring delays.
Sales for the remainder of 1987 are expected to continue as they have during the year to date, including a "good but not outstanding" Christmas selling season. Next year's sales are expected to be 5 to 10 percent ahead of 1987.
Manufacturers' sales prices generally remain stable in the First District. Contacts mention that foreign competitors have raised prices far less than exchange rate changes would suggest; thus, despite rising costs for raw materials (such as pulp, paper, copper and chemical feedstocks for plastics) and for imports from their off-shore affiliates, most respondents are holding their own prices steady. Textile prices have even eroded slightly. Respondents also cite price resistance from the U.S. auto industry and the U.S. Department of Defense.
The employment report is mixed although the situation is muddled by some major restructurings and the first reported strike in many months. Declining employment—at about one-third of the firms—generally reflects restructuring efforts. Hiring is occurring at another third of the companies, primarily those producing tools, parts and other materials for the aerospace and auto industries.
Capital spending is generally running at or above last year's levels. By contrast with the recent past, when almost all capital spending was devoted to raising productivity, four firms indicate that some expenditures reflect expansions, including five new plants (two in New England).
First District manufacturers anticipate ending the year with good increases in sales and profits. In 1988 they expect sales to "chug along" at or slightly above the pace of GNP. Only one was concerned about a resurgence of inflation. Several believe raw materials prices will continue to rise faster than their own, however.
