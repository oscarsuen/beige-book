Employment continues to expand in the District. The oil and chemical industries are increasing output and adding workers. Retail sales are mixed, with consumer durables and autos showing some weakness. Housing construction has slowed, although commercial construction shows some strength. Exports are increasing; the weaker dollar is in part responsible.
Demand for drilling machinery has strengthened, expanding employment rolls. The chemical industry is posting rapid productivity growth and high capacity utilization rates as a result of efficiency measures and strong product demand. The pulp and kraft components of the paper industry also continue to benefit from the drop in the value of the dollar. The weakening of the dollar has helped to curb tire imports to the point where some domestic producers have been able to raise prices. Prospects are bright for the region's aluminum producers, and prices are strengthening as a result of strong demand. Recent government contracts are helping aerospace firms in the region. Electronic components continues to benefit from defense spending and a resurgence in computer sales.
Registrations in the Southeast rose 2 percent, with the rise accounted for by light trucks and vans. By July, imported cars accounted for 38 percent of sales, up from 31.7 percent a year earlier.
Commercial construction markets are mixed. The value, square footage, and number of commercial projects in the Southeast increased in August over year ago figures and are now expanding at rates similar to the nation's. Office construction is strong in Nashville, central Florida, and metro Atlanta. Commercial construction slowed in Mississippi from year-ago levels, and commercial property values declined. After weakness in nonresidential construction earlier in the year, new highways, streets, and bridges helped boost each state's August total nonresidential construction figures over those of August 1986.
Atlanta, Birmingham, Miami, and Nashville report improvements in mortgage collections. Consumer foreclosures are decreasing, although commercial foreclosures are increasing. Mobile, New Orleans, Jackson, and most of south Georgia report increases in delinquency rates. Mississippi thrifts note that an increased number of bankruptcies are being filed.
There are one-third more exploratory drilling rigs in operation in the District than a year ago, but this is still only 40 percent of the number operating in 1985. Crude oil production in the District continues a slow decline begun in early summer, reaching a level 6 percent below 1986 average daily production. There is considerable interest in the natural gas reserves at Mobile Bay because Florida's gas consumption is expected to increase 42 percent over the next decade.
