In general, the Second District economy registered some improvement since the last report. The latest purchasing managers' surveys showed a sizable increase in firms reporting better business conditions, and retailers experienced satisfactory sales in recent weeks. Office leasing activity was also good, but the residential construction market remains mixed. On the financial side, most small and mid-sized banks have raised their lending rates in response to prime rate increases at money center banks.
Items in strong demand during recent weeks were most kinds of apparel, accessories, and home furnishings. One retailer, however, noted a weakness in women's apparel throughout his chain, possibly reflecting disenchantment with some of the more extreme new fashions. Inventories were reported from 4 percent below to 4 percent above plan, which respondents found tolerable.
Plans were announced for several major new projects in the District. These include a proposal for a new residential community of some 1200 condominiums on a waterfront site in New Jersey where an auto assembly plant was formerly located and a project in Brooklyn to build 2500 middle-income apartments along the waterfront together with a public park, promenade, and space for light industrial use. On Long Island work is scheduled to begin in November on a 362- room hotel, resort, and conference center, the first phase of a $150 million mixed-use development which will also include town houses and an office building. In addition, the lifting of a 7-month building ban elsewhere on Long Island is expected to result in the construction of several residential and commercial projects that have been on hold.
Unemployment rates in the District showed little change in September when both New York and New Jersey posted rates of 4.5%. New York City's unemployment rate also fell to 4.5%, its lowest level in 17 years. While unemployment rates have dropped substantially throughout the District in recent years, analysts in some labor markets such as Buffalo view the decline with caution. They attribute much of the improvement to substantial outmigration and the substitution of low-paying service jobs for the high-paying manufacturing positions which once were prevalent.
The demand for office space in the District during recent weeks was generally good. A large number of modest-sized leasings strengthened Manhattan's midtown market while the downtown market was bolstered by steady demand and the withdrawal of a large block of space for subleasing. In their continuing battle to induce firms not to relocate, New York City officials were recently heartened by a survey showing that manufacturing firms more than doubled the amount of office space which they leased in Manhattan during the first half of this year compared with a year earlier. City officials are particularly concerned by the abundance of new, less expensive quarters across the Hudson River in New Jersey, fearing that a decline in New Jersey's high vacancy rates will come at the City's expense.
