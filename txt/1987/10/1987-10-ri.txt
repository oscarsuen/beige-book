As compared with respondents to our previous survey, more retailers this month reported they had job openings that they were unable to fill, and well over half indicated that they had raised wages in the last month. While they remain optimistic that their sales will increase in the next six months, most retailers do not plan to increase employment.
Manufacturers look for increases over the remainder of the year in all measures of their activity except employment and the workweek. It appears that the slower expected growth in employment is due primarily to tight labor markets. In our survey this month, more respondents than in our previous survey indicated they had unfilled job openings for skilled and unskilled labor, and 39 percent reported they had raised wages recently.
The nondurable goods sector showed a slightly stronger performance than the durable goods sector. Within the nondurable sector, textile and apparel respondents reported capacity utilization rates averaging 94 percent. Further increases in shipments and new orders are expected in these industries in the next six months.
In the mining sector, last month's data on coal production and comments by our directors indicated that electric utilities in the District were stockpiling coal, possibly in anticipation of a labor dispute involving coal miners early next year. Coal production rose in late September, and coal stocks at utilities also rose in recent weeks.
A good crab catch and strong prices helped Chesapeake Bay watermen this summer, but a parasite in oyster beds threatens to cut this year's oyster harvest in half. This reduction is likely to place severe financial stress on watermen and on small shucking houses.
