In some regions, trade and service firms are experiencing difficulty recruiting qualified workers, which in some cases is creating upward pressure on wages and salaries. Among unskilled workers, the new immigration law and possible increases in state minimum wages also may push wages up. In the Seattle area, employment service professionals report that it is an "applicant's market", with many job openings but high quality workers increasingly difficult to find. Workers either are staying with their current jobs, or are requiring more money to be induced to move. In contrast, wage pressures appear to be absent for the most part in Arizona, Utah, and eastern Washington, while Oregon's general economic health appears to have had little effect on wages thus far.
In southern California, demand for real estate continues strong, due in part to an abundance of foreign buyers, particularly from Japan.
