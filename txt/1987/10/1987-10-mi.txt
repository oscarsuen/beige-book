Recent economic news from the Ninth District has been generally quite positive. In many areas, labor markets are actually tight. Consumer spending has been mainly favorable, although housing and construction, not surprisingly, have weakened. Among resource-related industries, mining has been exceptionally strong and oil drilling has even perked up a bit. And reports from the region's important agriculture sector are the most positive in some time.
District sales of motor vehicles have been quite good. One domestic auto manufacturer indicates that September sales were good, even compared to an excellent August. The new 1988 vehicles have been selling well, and more equipment is being included as standard features on these models. Another domestic manufacturer reports that sales are strong, up slightly over the brisk business at this time last year. The manufacturer says consumers can expect about a 4 percent increase in car and light truck prices.
In general, reports on tourist spending have been favorable. In Montana, North Dakota, and western South Dakota, tourist traffic has been up slightly over last year's respectable levels. In the Upper Peninsula, observers say the weather has been perfect. Motel business there has been from 20 to 40 percent higher than last year's.
Although reports are mixed, recent developments in housing and construction run counter to the favorable conditions of most district sectors by showing considerable signs of weakness. In Montana, the housing market has been poor, and new construction there is virtually nonexistent, except in the Great Falls area. In Minnesota, August housing permits fell about 11 percent from a year ago, and in Minneapolis-St. Paul, August permits were down about 22 percent from last year. Multifamily permits have been hit most severely. In North Dakota, housing markets seem a bit stronger than elsewhere in the district. There, sales have bottomed out and prices have firmed, although new construction is low in most of the state.
