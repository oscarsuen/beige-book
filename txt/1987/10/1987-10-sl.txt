Despite the decline since the first quarter, District manufacturing employment has picked up in the most recent months, growing at a 2.4 percent rate in the three months through August. The recent growth was due to the continued expansion of food processing and turnarounds in the electrical equipment and textile/apparel industries.
The number of transportation equipment jobs also increased as auto assembly workers returned from layoffs. Planned layoffs of auto workers in the St. Louis area in mid-October were postponed due to increased car sales. Regional production of shoes, concentrated in Missouri, has been growing steadily in recent months. The increase was attributed by some local analysts to the declining exchange value of the dollar.
The pace of District nonresidential building has slowed recently due to weakness in Arkansas and Kentucky. District nonresidential contracts expanded by only 2.4 percent in the three months through August following a 20.9 percent gain in the previous three-month period.
Livestock producers have enjoyed a profitable year due to low feed costs and favorable meat prices. Beef prices remain high and prices for feeder cattle are the highest since 1979. Pork prices also remain high but are expected to fall because increased production is anticipated.
