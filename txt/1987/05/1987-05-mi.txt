The Ninth District's economy has improved slightly. Employment conditions have improved a bit. Consumer spending has been stable, with home spending continuing strong in metropolitan areas and tourist spending expected to pick up in rural areas. Some signs of improvement have also been noted by observers in agricultural areas. Resource-related industries, however, turned in a mixed performance.
Sales rates for motor vehicles continued to moderate from the rapid pace set last year. Reports from zone offices of domestic manufacturers show that district car and truck sales were only 0.1 percent higher early in April than they were a year earlier. One domestic manufacturer notes that its inventories are now too high; still, its district car sales were 7 percent higher this March than last. Domestic manufacturers also expect the falling yen-dollar ratio to aid sales further, as American buyers purchase domestic vehicles instead of Japanese ones. Other sources indicate that auto sales have slowed in agricultural areas of Montana and North Dakota.
Warm weather and reasonable financing continued to aid housing activity in the district. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, homes again sold briskly. For example, Minneapolis home sales in February exceeded year-earlier sales by nearly 35 percent and, in March, by 40 percent. In the metro area, single-family housing permits (an indicator of future sales) posted a 50 percent gain in February, compared to a year earlier. But multifamily housing construction declined in the metro area. Homebuilding is still slow in the oil patches of western North Dakota and Montana.
Harbingers of increased tourist spending are evident to observers of the tourist industry. The increasing popularity of historic forts is expected to help western North Dakota, hard hit by the oil and gas slump. In South Dakota, inquiries about summer travel are running 13 percent higher than last year. In Montana, inquiries are up 25 percent so far, and they are also up in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
This Bank's first-quarter survey of rural bankers also indicates some improvement in farm conditions. Many of the surveyed bankers believe that net farm income in their areas was higher in the first quarter than a year ago, citing lower production costs and higher government payments for the improvement. Especially helpful to farmers were advance deficiency payments and increased participation in the Conservation Reserve Program. The surveyed bankers also indicate that the rate of farm foreclosures has lessened somewhat.
