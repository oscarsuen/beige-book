Many savings institutions in the Tenth District have experienced weak deposit growth during the last year. In many cases, institutions have not competed aggressively for interest-sensitive deposits because of limited lending opportunities. The recent uncertainty surrounding recapitalization of the FSLIC has also dampened deposit inflows. Loan demand has been stronger recently because of mortgage refinancing and home equity loans. Mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates are finally improving somewhat in the Tenth District. Most respondents believe the recent surge in mortgage rates is temporary and that rates will return to their former levels.
The agricultural credit picture in the district is somewhat brighter this spring than in past years. With 90 to 100 percent of loan arrangements completed, it appears that less than 5 percent of borrowers will be denied credit this springâ€”a marked improvement over the last several years.
