Machinery manufacturers reported an increase in activity, the first such report this year. Their capacity utilization rate has risen 5 percentage points since our previous survey, and now stands at 61 percent. Activity in the region's textile industry apparently declined from a month ago, breaking a series of increases. Activity increased again in the apparel industry.
The percentage of manufacturers reporting price increases continues its trend upward. Forty-four percent of the firms surveyed reported increases in the prices they pay for materials, and 18 percent reported increases in the prices they charge for finished goods. Figures from the previous survey were 35 and 15 percent, respectively.
Looking ahead six months, manufacturers expect business conditions to continue to improve, although they have tempered their optimism somewhat since our previous survey.
District coal production so far this year is about 10 percent below what it was last year, and steam coal producers are concerned about a large potential increase in imported coal.
In general, retailers are optimistic that business conditions will improve over the next six months. Retailers continue to accumulate inventory, as evidenced by the 42 percent reporting increases in stocks compared with only 8 percent reporting decreases.
