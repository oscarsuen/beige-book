March automobile sales are on par with sales a year ago. However, dealers are still feeling the effects of the 1986 incentive programs and tax law changes as current sales remain sluggish. Domestic dealers expect moderate price increases (2 to 3 percent) as a weak dollar forces import dealers to increase prices. The increase in inventories of Japanese-built cars have prompted some Japanese automakers to consider sales incentives.
Total employment in Ohio grew by only 4,000 jobs (.09 percent) from January to February. Services continued to dominate the increase in jobs. In February service employment increased by 7,000 while manufacturing employment grew by only 1,400. The trend toward services is even more dramatic over the last year: 56,000 additional workers were employed in services, while 12,000 fewer workers were employed in manufacturing.
Average weekly earnings of production workers declined by $2.68. This decline was due entirely to a reduction in the length of the average work week.
Raw steel production in Ohio increased 17.5 percent during March. Much of this increase was presumably due to new orders since inventories continued to decline in recent months. The rate of capacity utilization was at its highest level in over a year, which may help to explain the increase in prices of many types of steel products.
With fixed-rate mortgage rates increasing as much as two percentage points in the past month, there is concern that the recent boom in the housing market may be short-lived. One loan officer that we contacted indicated that the number of new loan applications is down 75 percent from the high a month ago. He feels that many potential home buyers are taking a "wait and see" attitude before locking in at the current interest rate.
