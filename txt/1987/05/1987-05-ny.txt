In general, the Second District economy registered a modest improvement since the last report. Retailers had better-than-expected sales gains during March and the homebuilding season has gotten underway with a good start. Office leasing was reported to be good and general business conditions were described as stable to improved. On the financial side, small and mid-sized banks report that growth in consumer lending has been weak since the beginning of the year.
With March sales ranging 1 to 3 percent above goals that were described as "aggressive", inventories have generally been maintained at or below desired levels. One chain with higher-than-intended stocks indicated that paring its inventories is a major objective in the weeks immediately ahead.
Unemployment rates edged lower in both New York and New Jersey during March to 4.7 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively. As nonmanufacturing employment expanded further, unemployment rates remained at their lowest levels in 17 years.
With the termination of the Air Force training plane contract with Fairchild Republic in March, the long-feared closing of that company's Long Island plant is now underway. Some 1,800 of its 3,500 employees have already been dismissed and the plant is scheduled to close by year-end. A group of former employees is attempting to purchase the facility and resume aircraft production, but the success of this plan is seen as unlikely. More positive news in recent weeks was Eastman Kodak's announcement that it will build a new $200 million color film plant at its manufacturing complex in Rochester, consolidating technology it has been developing around the world.
Office leasing activity in the Second District has been good recently but not substantial enough to reduce vacancy rates in areas of oversupply. Rates in northern New Jersey and Fairfield and Westchester counties, e.g., remain in the 20 to 25 percent range and projects already in the pipeline continue under construction. With an overall official vacancy rate of about 8 percent, New York City is still one of the healthiest markets in the country. While it is generally expected that midtown will show some improvement in 1987, opinion is divided about the vacancy rate in lower Manhattan, where about 7 million square feet of new office space is scheduled to come on line.
