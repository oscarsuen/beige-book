At the same time, some argue that the escalating trade friction has opened up Japanese markets to U.S. firms. In addition, both Taiwan and South Korea, fearing possible retaliatory actions against them, have taken significant steps to reduce tariffs and duties on a large number of items. Moreover, Japanese firms can be expected to continue shifting more production to the U.S., with California a prime candidate for that investment. Finally, if allegations about semiconductor "dumping" are true, and if U.S. trade measures curtail dumping, western electronics firms should benefit.
Lumber demand continued strong through the early part of the year. Through February, orders taken by western lumber mills were up 21 percent over a year ago and production was up 17 percent. Lumber inventories, which were relatively low entering the year, have increased and firms appear satisfied with current inventory levels. Lumber exports continue to show large increases over a year ago. A 15 to 25 percent increase in export volume to Europe during the first quarter, plus higher products prices, have put dollar sales well ahead of last year's pace. Lumber exports through the Port of Portland reportedly increased 500 percent while log exports rose 200 percent between January 1986 and January 1987.
Box shipments, which track industrial production, were up 2.6 percent through February over the first two months of 1986, while linerboard production rose 6.6 percent. Domestic demand increased by 6.7 percent, compared with a 5.6 percent increase in export demand.
In Utah, the reopening of the Kennecott Copper facility pushed the mining industry to its first year-to-year employment growth in nearly three years with a 1.2 percent employment increase.
Virtually all respondents expect slow multifamily residential construction activity due to past overbuilding and high vacancy rates. Consequently, the total number of housing units built in 1987 may fall below its 1986 level in many areas.
