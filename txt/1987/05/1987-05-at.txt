The region's economic indicators continue to show signs of expansion for most non-energy related sectors in early spring. Output and employment are increasing for key regional industries such as textile, aerospace, and building products. Easter retail sales were favorable, but strength in auto sales was limited to imported vehicles. District building permits increased, and builders anticipate vigorous spring construction. International tourism is up, and rising imports are still boosting port activity. Less positively, farmers will reduce plantings, and the peach crop was severely damaged by cold weather. The petroleum and coal extraction industries remain at a low ebb with little reason to expect improvement at least for the near term.
For the first time in years, textile industry spokesmen have a positive outlook for their sector. After a shakeout in which many weaker firms either went out of business or were absorbed by stronger firms, profits and orders are rising, and employment levels are increasing. Defense spending also continues to bolster employment in the region, helping to maintain the Southeast's manufacturing jobs near a record high level. For example, two large aerospace companies have announced major contracts for the middle Georgia area, which are expected to spawn over 30 satellite industries to service the contracts.
Demand appears to be holding up for the building products industry, although industrial spokesmen are concerned about the recent rise in mortgage interest rates. Paper packaging manufacturers report brisk business with hefty order backlogs.
District car dealers reported mixed sales behavior through mid-April; softening demand for some domestic models was partially offset by continued growth in sales of imported vehicles. Despite price hikes, imports continued to fuel much of the activity in dealers' showrooms.
An oversupply of space still plagues the Sixth District's commercial construction industry. Atlanta developers say speculative building is very slow, and lenders require substantial preleasing when financing new projects.
The falling dollar apparently has not yet improved trade activity at District ports. In New Orleans, for example, import volume continues to climb stubbornly. Port officials report that much of the recent tonnage increase there is due to rising imports of auto parts from Brazil, bagged fruits from the Caribbean, and steel and ore products from various countries. Except for forest products, exports are less than expected. An improving trade volume through Florida's ports is principally attributable to rising exports to the gradually recovering economies of Latin America.
In the agricultural sector, land values appear to be stabilizing. Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee experienced modest increases in average prices during the past year, while Louisiana and Mississippi suffered further severe declines. District farmers intend to cut planted acreage by an additional 9 percent this year, further shrinking the prospective demand for products of farm suppliers. A late freeze eradicated about half of the region's peach crop.
The lumber industry reports that southern pine is selling at prices 14 percent above a year ago, reflecting a combination of influences including the Canadian export tax on lumber, rainy weather reduction in local production, and strong residential housing demand.
