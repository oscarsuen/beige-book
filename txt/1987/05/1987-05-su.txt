The economy appears to be continuing on a course of moderate expansion, according to reports gathered in April. The agricultural sector, while certainly not in the clear yet, is showing signs of improvement. Manufacturers continue to post modest gains, bolstered by growth in both domestic sales and exports. Residential construction remains strong, especially in the single-family market, and has been relatively unaffected by the recent climb in mortgage rates. Retailers are making slight gains over year-ago levels in sales of general merchandise, although auto sales are about the same as or lower than last year. Bankers say business and real estate loans are growing, but demand for consumer loans is subsiding.
The only uniformly negative reports are those on the energy industry, which remains depressed despite the higher price of oil. As a result, the regional economies heavily dependent on energy remain in the doldrums.
Livestock farmers are expected to benefit from a combination of lower production costs and stronger prices for cattle, hogs, and sheep. Severe weather in some parts of the mid-west had an adverse effect on livestock, but the outlook there remains positive as well. Crop farmers in the southeast and mid-west have had spring field work delayed by wet weather. When planting is completed, however, acreage devoted to corn and soybeans is expected to be significantly reduced from 1986 levels. Wheat acreage should stay about ever, with last year's level. Cotton prices have increased significantly this year, and production is expected to follow suit. A late frost in the southeast destroyed as much as 50 percent of the peaches in that area; reports from Richmond, however, indicate expectations of a good yield for fruit farmers in that District.
Demand for lumber is growing. Atlanta reports increasing prices for southern pine; San Francisco indicates orders for lumber in the northwest have risen by over 20 percent from a year ago, in part because of substantial increases in exports to Europe.
Industrial prices are headed up at least slightly in most areas, with rising prices for steel and pulp specifically mentioned by Boston, Chicago, and Minneapolis.
While domestic sales seem to be stronger, at least some of the improvement in the industrial sector has been related to the export market as well. Dallas reports that the falling value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets specifically has contributed to an uptick in the chemical industry. Manufacturers in the San Francisco District say the trade tension between the U.S. and Japan has helped to open markets not only in that country but in South Korea and Taiwan as well.
Office-leasing activity is reported by Boston and New York to be good. There are some pockets of excess capacity in both Districts, however, with vacancy rates as high as 20 percent in some areas of suburban New York. Atlanta indicates that commercial construction is slow, and that some lenders are requiring pre-leasing before they approve financing for projects.
Auto sales are running at or below year-ago levels. Sales of domestic cars are uniformly sluggish. Japanese imports show more strength but are also slow in some areas: Atlanta indicates that demand for Japanese cars remains strong despite price hikes, while Cleveland reports that import dealers in that District are accumulating unwanted inventories and are considering sales incentives.
