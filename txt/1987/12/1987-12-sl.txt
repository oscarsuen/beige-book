Regional nonfarm employment grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, matching the national rate. While employment in most District sectors grew more slowly than the national average, the financial, government and manufacturing sectors grew more rapidly. District manufacturing employment grew at a strong 4.2 percent pace in the third quarter with gains concentrated in industries sensitive to foreign competition, particularly textiles and apparel, electrical equipment and transportation equipment. Several thousand auto workers began a layoff of indefinite length in late November.
Consumer SpendingReports indicate that District retail sales were flat in the third quarter. Spending in Memphis, however, has increased rapidly in recent months, especially on automobiles and other durables. Contacts reported little noticeable effect of the stock market downturn on subsequent retail sales. The outlook for District sales in the fourth quarter is mixed. Contacts in most areas anticipate only slight to moderate growth over last year's sales. Some retailers in western Tennessee expect fourth quarter sales to be slightly lower than a year earlier, as spending slows after a strong third quarter and shaken consumer confidence inhibits spending.
Residential construction weakened in the third quarter with both single-family and multi-family building declining. Contacts noticed a few cancellations of upscale homes ordered before the October stock market plunge, but the overall effect has been minimal. The recent slowdown in existing home sales is attributed primarily to seasonal factors and only secondarily to declining consumer confidence.
Nonresidential building declined in the third quarter in most part of the region, with District contracts down 9.1 percent. Tennessee, however, has reported steady gains throughout the year.
The crop year has been a good one with abundant yields of most crops. Cotton and corn yields were far above previous records in many states, while rice yields matched last year's record. Dry weather has allowed farmers to harvest crops at a quick pace, but has harmed the soybean, tobacco, wheat and pasture crops in the southeastern parts of the District.
