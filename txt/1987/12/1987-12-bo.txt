Most First District manufacturing contacts enjoyed a strong third quarter. A majority report no impact from the decline of the stock market, but some manufacturers have had customers delay orders. Recent retail results have also been mixed. Some retail chains, notably discounters, have seen no fallout from the stock market; these chains continue to register substantial sales increases compared to a year earlier. Others report a noticeable weakness in November to date. There is a near-unanimous expectation among manufacturers and retailers, even those continuing to do well, that customers will be more conservative in coming months as a result of the recent volatility in financial markets.
Inventories are said to be generally satisfactory. Orders are being carefully scrutinized to assure "sufficient but not excessive" Christmas merchandise. The perception is widespread that suppliers have additional merchandise available to fill late orders if business picks up more than expected.
Plans for the future are characterized as "conservative," responding to the uncertainty generated by the stock market's volatility. However, no drastic changes are projected. New England merchants remain moderately optimistic about the Christmas season and 1988. Fourth-quarter sales are expected to exceed last year's, in some cases by a modest amount, in others by as much as 20 percent. A similar growth range is forecast for 1988.
With respect to the period since the third quarter, one-third of respondents report some fallout from the stock market decline. They generally cite delays rather than cancellations of orders and believe that customers are drawing down inventories in order to avoid commitments. Among the majority of firms that have seen no effects, two capital goods makers caution that their orders tend to lag other economic changes.
First District manufacturers also report little evidence of resurgent inflation. A few respondents mentioned increases in copper, paper, chemicals and trucking costs; however, most said their own prices were steady or falling while a minority reported increases of up to 3 percent.
Employment levels are generally holding steady or are declining through attrition. Firms remain very reluctant to hire, although one large firm plans a major hiring program.
Capital spending is at or, in several cases, well above last year's levels. While most respondents see no reason to change these spending plans, two or three are holding back on discretionary purchases and are considering ways to maintain their flexibility by leasing rather than buying, for instance.
A majority of First District manufacturers are looking forward to a good 1988 with no adverse impact from the stock market. However, one firm that expects excellent sales growth in 1988 has reduced its forecast for its industry's growth by about one-third. Moreover, a significant minority of First District firms expect a flat fourth quarter and very slow growth in the first half of next year. Even among those expressing confidence, several contacts said they will be watching consumer spending very closely and one tool maker expressed concern about the impact of stock buybacks on its customers' capital spending plans.
