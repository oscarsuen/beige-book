Most bankers report that they have seen no significant changes in loan demand since mid-October. One financial institution, with offices throughout the West, noted a decline in mortgage applications the week of October 19, but since then activity has been at levels comparable to those seen throughout 1987. However, a southern California institution reports that demand for residential real estate loans has dropped by about 10 percent in recent weeks. There was some initial concern about asset quality of stock-secured loan portfolios, but closer examination has revealed few significant problems.
