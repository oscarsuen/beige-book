The Southeast's economy continues to show a mixed performance. Auto sales and residential construction have slowed but tourism, financial services, and most other industries have improved or remained stable. Retail sales declined briefly in late October but have since rebounded. For the most part, capital spending plans have not been altered recently. The prevalent attitude seems to be one of cautious optimism. In this report we have concentrated on developments since the stock market crash in mid-October.
The region's appliance and furniture producers are concerned that the stock market plunge may result in more conservative spending patterns. Spokesmen for the carpet industry are also uneasy about possible consumer belt tightening and a construction slowdown.
Textile companies are leaner and more competitive than in the past as exports have bolstered the industry. The lower value of the dollar is also stimulating domestic sales by making imports more expensive. There have been no signs of slowing in the paper industry. If lower domestic new car sales and output persist, district tire and auto part producers expect increased replacement goods demand to make up for some of the loss of original equipment business.
There is some indication that the impact on discount stores was less severe than on full service department stores. Sales ended the month flat or slightly above last October, and early indications for November are moderately favorable.
Expectations for the holiday season were not adjusted significantly after the market's fall since retailers throughout the District had already been expecting only slight increases over last year's sales. Promotional activity will be increased compared to last year, but most retailers report they are not at this point giving price discounts. They also have not altered their hiring plans for the holiday season.
Auto sales in October and early November slowed according to dealers but they believe the behavior had more to do with the removal of factory incentives than the plunge in stock prices. Despite concern over weakened consumer confidence, dealers' plans remain largely unchanged.
Metropolitan office vacancy rates during 1987's third quarter remained steady but high ranging from 18 percent to almost 30 percent. Only Jacksonville showed significant improvement in absorption, as vacancy rates decreased by more than eleven percent since last quarter. Office and industrial developers in the region report a number of projects are on hold, reflecting earlier overbuilding. Meanwhile retail construction has sustained its strength throughout the region as mall construction flourishes.
Spokesmen in the pulpwood industry report a thriving industry. There is some indication of slight capacity expansion but caution prevails. The lumber industry is experiencing a seasonal softening in markets and slight price declines.
District crude oil production fell in October to a level almost 10 percent lower than the peak in early 1986. Production capacity has declined with the cutbacks in exploration since the early 1980s and with the closing of numerous inefficient stripper type wells. On the other hand, drilling activity increased, reaching its highest point since March of 1986.
District coal production rose modestly in October making the third consecutive month of higher output, supplying evidence of a beginning recovery in the coal industry.
