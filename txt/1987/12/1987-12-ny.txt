Economic activity in the Second District varied among sectors in recent weeks. In moat areas general business conditions improved somewhat further, and office leasing was strong. However, conditions in residential construction and retail sales were mixed, and in the wake of the stock market crash, concern has developed regarding the outlook for the New York City economy. Small and mid-sized banks report that demand for consumer installment loans remains strong.
Over-the-year sales gains in October generally ranged from 9 to 13 percent although one retailer reported a much smaller increase at his suburban stores in the District. Soft goods such as apparel and accessories, shoes, and jewelry were mentioned as selling well, but some higher priced items like furniture, furs, and rugs moved slowly.
District retailers are not overly optimistic concerning the upcoming holiday season. Several respondents have adopted a wait-and-see attitude in response to what one termed "the new conservatism among consumers".
Some planned projects, most of them announced since the stock market crash, point to a positive impact on the District's economy. After several months' search, two large banks have chosen Buffalo as the location for their new facilities. Goldome announced that it will buy the former Bethlehem Steel regional headquarters building for use as its new telecommunications center, while Marine Midland will construct a 840 million back-office facility there. In addition, three manufacturing firms also announced plans to expand in the Buffalo area. Groundbreaking ceremonies recently took place in the Syracuse area for the regional distribution center of a package handling company which will provide several hundred new jobs upon completion. Meanwhile, in northern New Jersey, Hudson County's first shopping mall opened at Newport City, the multibillion dollar residential and commercial development under construction there. Some 2500 jobs are expected to be created at the mall with first preference going to county residents.
Office leasing activity continued strong in much of the District though some slowing occurred in the downtown Manhattan market. Analysts attributed this slowdown to employment cutbacks at some brokerage firms and plans announced by others to review their staffing needs. Concern over the additional impact that the stock market crash will have on the securities and financial services industries added to the cautious tone in the downtown market. Expansion in these industries has been a major source of demand for new office space in recent years.
