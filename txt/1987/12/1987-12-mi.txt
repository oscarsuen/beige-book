Black Monday appears to have had minimal effect on the Upper Midwest economy, at least according to the information received so far. There have been a few reports of order cancellations for commercial and industrial equipment. And automobile and retail sales have both been flat in November. However, our sources attribute that weakness to causes other than the stock market. The mining sector remains quite strong, and virtually all reports from the agricultural sector are rosy. Labor markets remain quite tight in almost all parts of the Ninth District.
Some reports say early holiday shopping has been weak, and these sources believe the stock market crash is at least partly to blame. However, one large retail reports that October sales were the best since February. Its sales showed only a slight decline after the stock market crash and then remained a bit soft in early November. The retailer does not attribute this recent weakness to stock market action and is confident of brisk holiday sales. All our contacts expect a highly promotional holiday season, with many good bargains for consumers. Wholesale food prices are down and should quickly translate into some reduction in retail prices.
Farm spending has been increasing. Tractor sales are up sharply, and a North Dakota tractor manufacturer is producing at or near capacity. As reported last month, farmers are using improved cash flows to pay down their debts. One ag banker even reports that farmers complained of interest rates being too lowâ€”obviously reflecting their shift in position from net debtor to net creditor. In South Dakota, a new facility for a million laying hens is planned; its construction should begin in spring of 1988.
