District savings institutions generally report deposit inflows above year-ago levels. Conditions vary greatly by state, however. Some institutions experienced large deposit inflows after the stock market decline in October, while others were unaffected. Most respondents report weak mortgage demand, primarily reflecting sluggish local economies. Mortgage rates have fallen recently and are expected to be relatively stable for the rest of the year. Some respondents anticipate higher mortgage rates in 1988.
The decline in the stock market apparently had little effect on most respondent banks, as only a small share of their loans is secured by stocks. Some respondents believe the decline stimulated deposit growth. Several respondents think banks should reexamine their own portfolios and trust portfolios and maintain or adopt conservative portfolio management practices. Others think bank behavior will not be affected because banks were not hurt by the decline. One respondent commented that the decline should not be used as a reason for inhibiting amendment of the Glass-Steagall securities restrictions on banks.
Lenders are generally optimistic about the rate of paydown on production loans this year and expect paydowns to be somewhat above last year, due partly to the good fall yields and strong livestock receipts. Winter credit reviews are underway and bankers report that both credit applications and credit refusal rates likely will be about the same as last year.
