Most Districts report overall economic expansion with particular strength noted in Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Despite general optimism among surveyed firms, there was also widespread evidence of increased uncertainty about future growth in demand. Furthermore, while the majority of survey respondents said that the stock market crash had not materially altered their capital spending plans, reports of at least some deferrals of plans appeared in a number of District discussions. The manufacturing sector has been a prime source of recent expansion in most Districts. Retail sales are either flat or only slowly growing in most Districts and auto sales are generally sluggish. Construction activity is mixed. Mining is strong across a broad spectrum of extractive industries, but reports of the possibility of future softening in oil and gas drilling expansion were common. The agriculture sector is in a generally favorable condition among the Districts. In the financial markets, some slowing in the growth of loan demand was often cited.
