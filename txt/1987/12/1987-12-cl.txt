The Ohio, employment continued to increase across a broad range of sectors, including manufacturing which has experienced a resurgence in recent months. Over the year, total employment in Ohio rose 2.5 percent, while the number of unemployed decreased 34 percent. Despite the overall improvement in employment, the number of manufacturing workers fell 6,000 over the year to date. Losses were concentrated in durable-goods industries. Modest gains in primary metals, lumber and wood products, food and kindred products, and chemicals were not sufficient to overcome losses in transportation equipment, nonelectrical machinery, and fabricated metal products. Nonmanufacturing employment, on the other hand, increased 3.5 percent, with the largest percentage gains in construction and services.
Earnings of production workers in manufacturing industries in Ohio continued to increase through September, primarily due to increased overtime. Their average workweek of 42.5 hours in September was .2 hours longer than the previous month.
Steel production increased sharply in October, rebounding from earlier declines. Production in the Youngstown and Pittsburgh districts, for example, increased by roughly 25 percent from the previous month. Some respondents commented that this production increase is taxing an already high capacity utilization rate.
The recent stock market decline appears to have had little effect of capital spending plans of area businesses. A supplier of drills, valves and other industrial tools reported that they see no indication that their customers are planning to cutback or reduce expenditures. Plans for large scale investment projects, such as the relining of a blast finance in the Youngstown area and the restarting of a mill in western Pennsylvania, appear to be moving along as scheduled.
