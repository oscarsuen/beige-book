The District economy continues to grow very slowly, driven mainly by expansion in manufacturing. Construction activity is showing renewed signs of weakness. The rise in drilling has begun to abate. Retail sales continue to be sluggish while auto sales are particularly weak. The balance sheets of District financial institutions fail to show any marked improvement. District agricultural productprices are markedly above a year earlier.
District construction appears to have resumed a protracted downturn that had abated during the second quarter of 1987. In the third quarter, the value of construction contracts in District states fell below that of the previous quarter and below that of the third quarter of 1986. Both residential and nonresidential construction contracts slipped. Nonbuilding construction activity, which showed strength in the first half of this year, has also begun to fall. Single and multifamily residential building permits are declining, as well. Construction employment, which responds with a lag to fluctuations in building contract values, has stabilized in recent months.
