Most savings institutions report weak inflows or moderate outflows of savings over the last twelve months, but with some improvement in the last month. Most respondents expect some further improvement in the near future. Demand for mortgage funds is fairly weak, and opinions vary about future demand. Mortgage interest rates have softened a bit in some areas, but respondents generally expect slight increases in the future.
The Farmers' Home Administration's (FmHA) loan guarantee program has also met with mixed results. Some agricultural lenders are using few or no guarantees, because of the additional paperwork and past difficulties in securing FmHA approval. Other bankers are gradually increasing their use of FmHA loan guarantees, while still others are enthusiastically using the loan guarantee program for as many as 20 percent of their borrowers.
Most bankers have acquired farm real estate through foreclosures, and are handling the acquired property in a variety of ways. A few lenders are selling farmland as soon as possible after foreclosure, with little regard for price. In most cases, however, lenders note that most properties are not selling due to a lack of interested buyers. In the meantime, acquired farmland is being leased out by lendersâ€”in some cases for the third consecutive year.
