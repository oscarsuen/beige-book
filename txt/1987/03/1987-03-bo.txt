This month's reports from First District retailers and manufacturers were the most positive in some time. Retailers were both pleased and surprised by the strength of February sales. For the most part, auto dealerships were exceptions to the generally favorable sales picture, but within this group too there were reports of surprisingly good sales volumes. Reports from the manufacturing sector still indicate little vitality; nevertheless, there is some evidence of a gradual pickup in orders and respondents seem more optimistic about the future.
Retail inventories have increased, but respondents express no concern about this development. Manufacturing inventories are low by historic standards and respondents intend to keep them this way. No significant price changes have been observed by either retailing or manufacturing respondents.
Inventories were reported to be somewhat high. Some increases were by design. Others were not, but contacts did not regard these unplanned increases with much concern.
Prices are said to be stable, except for pharmacy items. However, one department store owner reported "reliable rumors" that prices will be up noticeably for fall merchandise because of the decline in the value of the dollar.
First District retailers are expecting a good first half of the year although they do not expect February's surprisingly high rates of increase to be sustained. The representative of a chain concentrated in the more rural areas of the East and Midwest said its stores in the Northeast are doing better than those elsewhere - a pattern he expects to continue.
Cost containment continues to be a high priority. Inventory-to-sales ratios are generally low by historic standards. One contact commented that large purchases to take advantage of volume discounts are a thing of the past; his firm now bays precisely what it needs. Another observed that his firm's customers are doing the same thing: formerly they bought in lots of 5,000; now they order exactly "2,112" items. In a similar vein, employment levels are stable to slightly down, even for companies experiencing volume growth. One high tech firm noted that, because of automation, his firm must increase volume 15 percent just to maintain its manufacturing work force; the firm is currently growing at a 5 to 10 percent rate. Most respondents expect capital spending in 1987 to be fairly similar to that in 1986. No significant increases in vendor prices were observed. One contact had successfully increased its own prices at year-end, while another reported that its prices have been falling on average.
