The same factors contributed to weakness in non-residential building. December surveys indicate that office vacancy rates in downtown Memphis and St. Louis were above the national average. The value of nonresidential construction contracts declined 9.2 percent in the fourth quarter, following a 15.4 percent increase in the third quarter.
The average financial position of agricultural banks in the District, which had declined over the previous three years, appears to have stabilized and improved in 1986. This improvement is evident in third quarter measures of bank profitability, loam defaults, loam delinquencies and bank capital. The number of individual agricultural banks with negative earnings and deficient capital increased slightly, however, indicating a widening dispersion of performance among the institutions.
