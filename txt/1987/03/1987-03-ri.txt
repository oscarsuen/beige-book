Prices of raw materials rose in the past month according to 36 percent of the producers; 5 percent report declines, Three-fourths of the producers report a change in the prices they charge for finished goods, with the remaining one-fourth about evenly split between those reporting increases and those reporting declines. Responding to a separate survey question, 45 percent of the manufacturers report that, since the first of the year, the prices of their imported materials have risen.
Optimism among producers is growing. Sixty-eight percent of this month's respondents anticipate increases in shipments and new orders in the next six months, as compared with 61 percent last month. More than one-third of the respondents now believe they will increase employment and lengthen the workweek over the next six months. As was the case last month, this month's survey indicates that over half of the producers expect improvement in general business conditions over the next six months. Added optimism is evident in that a smaller proportion of the respondents—one eighth this month as compared with one fifth last month—expect conditions to deteriorate.
Resort and other hotel bookings for the summer are stronger than last year this time. Overnight spaces at many state parks are already booked to capacity. Public and private sector respondents to a special telephone survey say they expect even stronger tourist activity in 1987 than in the stronger-than-average 1986 season. Tourist businesses expect their profits to rise commensurately.
