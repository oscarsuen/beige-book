February automobile sales began significantly below last year's levels due to the end-of-year buying spree. However, by mid-month sales picked up and now appear to be on par with last year's sales. Domestic dealers reported that the weaker dollar is helping them compete with Japanese imports. Japanese import dealers reported slightly higher inventories. In addition, prices increased slightly in March in order to maintain an acceptable profit margin.
Raw steel production for the Lake Erie and Pittsburgh regions continually increased throughout February. Employment in the basic steel industries also increased, reflecting to some extent the resolution of the USX work stoppage.
The region continues to be marked by large scale plant closings and layoffs. General Motors recently announced plans to close plants in the Greater Cincinnati area that will affect over 8,000 workers. Firestone and Goodyear have also announced layoffs. At the same time, the region continues to be a target for foreign investment, especially automobile assembly and parts facilities. For example, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, recently announced plans to build a $25 million plant to produce car audio equipment, car electronics and electrical parts for the U.S. auto industry.
