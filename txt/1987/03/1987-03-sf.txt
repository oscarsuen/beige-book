Car sales have fallen since the first of the year in most parts of the District, as the tax-induced sales surge in December suggested they would. Auto sales decreased dramatically between December and January in California, Washington, Oregon, and Utah.
Many firms plan to spend less on capital investments during 1987 than they did during 1986. These decreases are attributed to slow economic activity overall, to an increased focus on cost-cutting associated with recent restructuring, or to the reduced investment incentives under the new tax bill. One savings and loan plans to spend 15 to 20 percent less in 1987 than it did in 1936, while a survey of pulp and paper producers reveals that they plan to decrease investment spending by an average of 24 percent.
On the other hand, a survey conducted during January in Arizona suggests that investment spending in that state is likely to remain stable, since about 20 percent of the respondents said they would increase capital spending, while another 20 percent planned decreases and the remainder planned to continue spending at their 1986 levels. Throughout the District, investment spending is expected to increase for firms whose economic fundamentals indicate substantial investments, including an energy distribution company and a retailer that are expanding their territories, and a forest products firm newly flush with funds.
An unusual mid-January frost in southern California caused extensive damage to avocado and citrus caps in Ventura and San Diego counties. The estimate of total damage currently stands at $60 million, although the California Avocado Commission reports avocado damage alone at $110 million. The damage, compounded by more generalized low yields, is likely to cause price increases for some fruits, vegetables, and nuts.
Western farmers should benefit from the last-minute trade pact agreed upon between the U.S. and the European Economic Community since it averts stiff European tariffs on such products as avocados (California), roasted nuts (California), and flower and vegetable seeds (Oregon), as well as further tariffs that could have been imposed on other specialty crops if the trade war had escalated.
