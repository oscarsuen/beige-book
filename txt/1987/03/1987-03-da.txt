Some important sectors of the Eleventh District economy remain weak, but signs of recovery are evident. Orders to manufacturers are growing, although very sluggishly. The drilling rig count slipped in February after growing at a fairly steady pace since July. Auto sales have dropped considerably and retail sales remain low. Construction is declining at a quickening pace, chiefly because of reductions in residential building. The balance sheets of District banks reflect the area's general economic performance, which is still below year-earlier levels. District cattlemen are selling their livestock at substantially higher prices than last year.
