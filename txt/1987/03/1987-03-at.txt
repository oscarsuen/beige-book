Economic activity has picked up in recent weeks. Manufacturing in the region is showing more life, reflecting better export demand and a reduction in import competition. Florida's citrus industry is prospering because of slowing imports of orange juice. Most of the energy sector remains depressed, but capital spending is rising in a few natural gas companies. Retail sales were unexpectedly strong in several District states, though auto sales were even weaker than they were in the nation in February. The region saw a moderate decline in single-family building permits, but builders seem quite optimistic that this decline was temporary. Tourism remains a strong positive force in the District.
The outlook is not as bright for the metals and machinery industries. Aluminum producers anticipate 1987 to be only marginally better than 1986. Specialty steel mills and steel fabricators that have managed to remain profitable are beginning to feel the effects of a sagging construction market. Reduced demand for oil well drilling equipment continues to dim prospects for the region's machinery industry.
Regional car sales in February posted improvement from January's dismal activity, but they were weaker than the nation's sales, which declined 9.1 percent from a year ago. Over the past year market shares of imports have risen to about one-third of total sales in at least two District states.
Commercial construction continues to slow as the region adjusts to overbuilding. New Orleans reports drastic employment cutbacks in both construction and related businesses. While the Miami office market is glutted, demand is healthy for smaller owner-occupied buildings. Improved occupancy of the overbuilt retail sector in Jackson, Mississippi, is renewing the interest of developers who had fled the market.
The region's savings and loans are generally performing well, although a few have had some difficulties, particularly in Louisiana and Florida. According to District financiers, problems can be attributed to several sources, including principally a heavy reliance on long-tern lending and weak economic conditions in certain areas.
Weather problems have delayed the regional production expansion that was expected following the imposition of the Canadian export tax on lumber. Very strong prices for southern pine have been characteristic this year, but once the weather improves prices are expected to fall. Demand has remained strong throughout the winter.
Orange producers are earning favorable returns as a result of price increases and reduced imports of Brazil's orange products. Although the domestic grapefruit market is languishing, the export market is flourishing thanks to the weak dollar and growing foreign consumption.
