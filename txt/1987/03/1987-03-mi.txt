Economic conditions in the Ninth District have remained steady so far in 1987. Unemployment rates rose, but most of the increase was seasonal. Consumer spending picked up in February. In resource-related industries, conditions remained mixed. And while some agricultural areas continued to show scattered signs of stabilization, farmers of major crops are still dependent on government programs for much of their income.
Sales of motor vehicles, after a very slow January, accelerated in February. One domestic manufacturer notes that its district car sales were much higher, while its truck sales only posted a modest gain. Another domestic manufacturer reports that unusually warm weather seemed to hamper its sales of' trucks and four-wheel-drive vehicles. Existing incentive programs seem to be sufficient to stimulate sales.
Housing market conditions in Minnesota are still favorable, although residential building contracts fell throughout the state in January. A representative of Twin Cities realtors is more positive about single-family housing prospects than a year ago. In contrast, housing activity is still way down in Montana's and North Dakota's largely inactive oil-drilling areas.
While not all resort areas experienced good winter tourism conditions, many that did had good business. A Bank director reports that one large resort in Michigan's Upper Peninsula had its best season ever, while lack of snow created problems for another resort there. Two observers in Montana report that an influx of Canadian tourists helped resort business there.
