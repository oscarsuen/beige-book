The Second District's economy showed some gains since the last report. January retail sales were mixed, but a decided improvement was noted in February. While residential construction was seasonally slack, a pick-up in office leasing was noted in several areas. Some improvement also occurred in District business activity. Most small and mid-sized banks report a noticeable slowdown in IRA deposits for this time of year.
Foreign visitors utilizing their stronger currencies are still mentioned as one factor bolstering District spending; another factor is the health of its economy relative to areas with oil and farm debt problems. Items for which there was good demand during January were most types of apparel, jewelry and accessories; February's sales gains resulted from consumer buying across a wide spectrum of merchandise. As a result of both the recent strength in sales and a conscious effort to monitor stocks, retailers report inventories ranging from well below desired levels to on plan.
Overall employment has grown in the District, though the manufacturing sector continues to decline. The February unemployment rates of 4.1 percent in New Jersey and 4.9 percent in New York were the lowest since the early '70s and are well below the national average. Moreover, the over-the-year reduction in the New York and New Jersey rates was three times the national decline.
Recent announcements point to a mixed impact on the District's economy. On the one hand, G.M.'s decision to produce its new mini-vans in Westchester County will secure several thousand jobs there for a number of years. On the other hand, several other long-established firms plan to curtail or phase out operations with a resultant loss of many jobs. In addition, while central New York will gain hundreds of jobs as the result of a recent merger, Buffalo and northern New Jersey will lose at least the same number due to that same consolidation.
A pick-up in office leasing activity was noted in several parts of the District during recent weeks, and with the continued slowdown in new construction projects, lower vacancy rates are anticipated in a number of areas. Westchester, for example, reports strong demand for both large and small blocks of space in its new buildings, while in Manhattan some observers expect the office vacancy rate to decline to 9 or 10 percent in 1987 from its 10 to 13 percent range last year. Elsewhere in the District, industrial space is reported in short supply in northern New Jersey, particularly in areas near New York City or major highways, and prices of land and buildings have risen sharply. Upstate New York expects 1987 to be a busy year for nonresidential construction as the result of congressional appropriations for extensive expansion and renovation of three military bases in the area.
