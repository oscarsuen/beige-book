In the second quarter the Ninth District's economy showed signs of continued improvement. Employment conditions strengthened early in the quarter. Consumer spending didn't grow by much, but neither did it weaken. Other improvements were noted in agriculture and resource-related industriesâ€”both of which have been weak spots in the district's economy.
Other district states also experienced heightened job growth. During April, employment rose and unemployment rates fell in the Dakotas and Montana. In South Dakota, durable goods manufacturing increased, and the April unemployment rate in the Sioux Falls metro area fell to only 2.7 percent.
Despite firm labor markets, relations between labor and management have been a concern at some major companies. A number of strikes have troubled the meatpacking industry and have affected 6,700 workers in South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska. One such strike is reported at a large meatpacking plant in Sioux Falls.
Motor vehicles sales have recently slowed. One large domestic manufacturer reports that its district sales were about 20 percent lower this May compared to May 1986. However, last May's sales were unusually high, so the recent decline wasn't overly severe. Another manufacturer says its late-May sales picked up and have been particularly strong in the Dakotas. Both manufacturers report that District inventories are normal for this time of year. Bank directors report that sales were slow in western parts of both Montana and Wisconsin.
Housing markets continued to be quite active in the district. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, housing permits were 17 percent higher during this year's warm April than in April 1986. Multifamily home construction was particularly strong. One Bank director notes that housing still remains affordable. But realtors are worried about future sales in light of recent increases in mortgage rates.
Compared with major crop production, conditions for meat-animal production continue to be more favorable. In Minnesota, prices for May lambs were the highest on record. A Bank director reports that cattle prices were still good. And members of this Bank's Advisory Council on Small Business, Labor, and Agriculture report that the hog market looks promising through August, and that farm income generally is on the rise. In fact, a big hog production facility is planned for the area around Pierre, South Dakota.
