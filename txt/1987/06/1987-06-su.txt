Most Federal Reserve Districts report moderate economic growth. Manufacturing orders and shipments continue to grow, with few reports of price increases or inventory buildup. Lumber production is operating near capacity due in part to an expansion of exports. Housing construction continues at a steady pace despite the recent increase in mortgage rates. High vacancy rates and the new tax laws have reduced commercial construction.
Most agricultural sectors remain depressed. Although recent increases in beef and hog prices have generated short-term earnings gains for cattle and hog producers, crop farmers still face problems of oversupply and low prices. The energy sector also remains depressed. Oil and coal producers report that drilling and mining operations are below last year's levels. However, oil drilling has increased in some areas as domestic oil prices rise. Growth in retail and automobile sales appears to be slowing. Higher prices, increased consumer indebtedness, and higher interest rates are the major reasons cited, Loan activity is also weak, Strong demand for commercial and real estate loans has not been enough to offset the reduction in the volume of consumer loans.
Also, quotas provide the incentive for foreign producers to import more expensive lines of clothing. The decline in the value of the dollar has been felt most strongly on prices of imports from Japan and European countries, whose currencies have appreciated most against the dollar. Prices of domestically produced apparel have also risen but not as much as prices of imported apparel. Much of the domestic price increase is due to domestic textile mills running near capacity.
Automobile sales are sluggish in most Districts. Dealers in the Minneapolis District report that automobile sales were 20 percent lower in May than a year ago. Weak auto sales raise the prospect for more aggressive sales incentives and further production cutbacks by domestic auto producers. As yet, domestic auto dealers have not discounted prices, and current production schedules have stabilized inventories. The declining value of the dollar has significantly reduced import auto sales by raising prices. Import dealers report declining profits, and inventories increased considerably in May.
The effect of the depreciation of the dollar on manufacturing is still mixed. Boston reports that none of its respondents attribute the gain in domestic orders to an easing of import competition. San Francisco, on the other hand, finds that manufacturers of some products that compete against low-cost imports report strengthening in sales and orders. In general, strong domestic demand appears to be the major force behind improvement in manufacturing. The increase in steel production, for example, appears to be attributable to increases in construction and in oil drilling operations, despite cutbacks in automobile production.
Most districts report that input prices are stable. There is some upward price pressure as certain products, especially steel products, continue to be in short supply.
Capital spending is reported to be moderately high by some Districts. Chicago reports sizable investments in upgrading facilities in the traditional, heavy-manufacturing industries.
Coal production has increased slightly in recent weeks, but both Atlanta and Richmond report that output is below last year's level. Some coal producers anticipate that the increase in oil prices nay help to shore up demand.
Most Districts report favorable crop conditions. A relatively dry spring has allowed crop planting to be finished ahead of schedule. Crop development appears good. although St. Louis reports that its dry spring may reduce wheat yields by as much as 20 percent. Crop prices, although slightly higher in the past few months, are anticipated to fall back to around the government subsidy levels.
Lumber production in the Pacific Northwest is running near peak capacity, primarily due to strong demand from China, Japan, and Europe. Recent interest-rate hikes temporarily reduced the volume of orders in April, but orders have picked up as mortgage rates have stabilized.
