More generally, respondents in Arizona and Washington report moderating of the previously robust activity in those two states. In Idaho, sales tax receipts for April were higher than they were in March, but remained substantially lower than their year-earlier level. Import-dependent retailers and distributors are being hurt by the reduction in imports that has taken hold in recent months.
The prospects for many western farmers have improved. Cattle producers are enjoying higher prices and lower feed costs, while potato and fruit growers benefit from a mild winter and increased production. California cotton commands prices double the level of last year, as strong foreign markets, notably in China, buoy demand.
However, dry weather in some parts of the District has raised concerns about summer yields. Wheat farmers, among others, continue to experience low prices. Despite high participation rates in government acreage-reduction programs that should reduce the current oversupply problem, they see little prospect of improvement. These problems are particularly apparent in eastern Washington and Oregon, in southern Idaho, and Utah.
In Kern County, California, oil industry prospects have improved modestly since the price of local oil rose to $13 per barrel from less than $10 a year ago. In contrast, Alaska's economy continues to founder. One company reports that the volume of freight it ships to Prudhoe Bay is down 70 percent from last year's level.
High vacancy rates and changes in the tax law caused a slowdown in commercial construction activity earlier in the year, and higher interest rates appear to have had little additional impact. A few projects which do not pencil out at the higher rates have been squeezed out. One banker argues that some developers have withdrawn loan applications, hoping that rates will fall later in the year.
