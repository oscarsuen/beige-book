New home sales jumped in April as buyers attempted to close deals before anticipated higher mortgage rates. In St. Louis and Memphis, sales were strong in April, but were expected to flatten in May. Single-family starts in Louisville were more than 30 percent above year-ago levels in April and May, although one real estate contact expects slowing in future months.
District nonresidential construction accelerated in recent months; nonresidential contracts issued in the three months through April grew 15.3 percent, outpacing the nation's 7.2 percent expansion. Extremely rapid growth in Arkansas offset declines in Tennessee.
Most of the loans sold or participated were sold to affiliate banks or U.S.-chartered banks with assets greater than $1 billion. The average maturity of these loan participations is approximately one year. District banks typically average a spread of 50 to 100 basis points as the "lead" bank in a participation transaction.
The volume of farm products shipped on the middle Mississippi River in the first four months of this year was 19 percent above the level of the same period last year.
