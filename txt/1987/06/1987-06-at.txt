The Southeast continues to show moderately increasing employment and falling unemployment rates, even in Louisiana and Mississippi where rates have been in double digits. Manufacturing employment has been increasing, especially in textiles. Construction of office buildings and homes has slowed, although warehouse and industrial construction is still strong. Production of oil and gas seems to have bottomed out.
District chemical producers supplying the apparel and textile industry have been prospering as a result of the rebound in textiles. The tire industry is strong as a result of lower prices for petrochemical raw products and growing demand attributable to increased auto travel. Food manufacturing is getting a strong lift from the expansion in poultry and fish processing industries. Spokesmen from the furniture manufacturing industry are optimistic, at least for the near term. The machinery industry, however, suffers from excess capacity and weak demand.
Car sales in the District were disappointing in May as major U.S. and Japanese manufacturers posted sharp declines in sales from levels a year earlier. Dealers' hopes for the traditionally strong pre-summer months were dashed despite attractive car-maker incentive programs to lure new buyers. Meanwhile, minivan, utility vehicle, and light truck sales are still growing.
Orlando builders report a decrease in office vacancy rates, although contacts in Atlanta and Birmingham say the construction pace has yet to slow enough to see significant rate declines. Office vacancy rates in the central business districts of Ft. Lauderdale and Memphis rank among the nation's highest. Contacts say the concentration of new office space in the suburbs of these cities is largely to blame.
District builders are more optimistic about development of industrial distribution and warehouse space. Atlanta's strong absorption rate has spurred assemblage of large land tracts for industrial development despite falling rental rates. Orlando contacts expect strong demand this year and steadily declining vacancy rates.
The lower dollar appears to be slowly fueling export growth in the District. Miami port officials report gradual improvements in exports to Latin America. Even so, exports and total port tonnage were both 10 percent below year-earlier levels for the first seven months of the fiscal year beginning in August 1986. In New Orleans, a rise in exports of pulp and paper and other manufactured products has substantially boosted port employment and revenues. Rebounding foreign sales of phosphates in the first four months this year pushed Tampa's export tonnage up by about 5 percent from the depressed level in the same period last year.
On balance, crop prospects currently appear favorable. There is some concern over low rainfall totals in the eastern half of the District. The poultry industry, suffering from production-induced price declines, is experiencing shrinking profits. Pork and cattle herds are apparently being rebuilt.
