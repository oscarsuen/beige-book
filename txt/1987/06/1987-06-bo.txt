Economic activity in the First District remains at a high level, although the composition of activity may have changed a little. The retail experience has been mixed, with some merchants facing flat sales and others enjoying large increases. Poor weather depressed sales in May; early June results have been stronger. Manufacturing respondents reported a fairly broad-based pickup in orders in the past couple of months. This increase is attributed to domestic demand, rather than an improving trade situation. While retailers are seeing rising import prices, manufacturers are not. Employers throughout the District are experiencing difficulty attracting and holding workers, particularly at the entry level.
The weather in New England was poor in May and sales generally suffered as a result. This was particularly true of seasonal items, which reportedly picked up markedly as the weather warmed at the end of the month. One store experienced a sudden drop in sales of major appliances in the middle of April which has not yet been reversed; another, however, said appliances advanced well while sales of homebuilding supplies declined.
A number of merchants reported difficulty in keeping stores and home offices fully staffed. Turnover is rising ("because it is so easy for employees to find new jobs") and it is difficult to hire new employees, especially at the lower-paid end of the market.
Forecasts for the remainder of the year are closely tied to recent performance. For stores performing poorly, this represents a more negative outlook compared with earlier this year.
Strong demand for apparel is leading to increases in the prices at which quotas are bought and sold among overseas manufacturers. Also, because the quotas limit the quantity (not value) of goods that foreign producers can send to the United States, the items now imported include fewer inexpensive goods. While the decline in the value of the dollar has had its strongest effects on the prices of imports from Japan and Europe, quotas also affect goods from countries with no currency appreciation relative to the dollar. In addition, the appreciation of the yen has contributed to price increases for Korean and Taiwanese apparel, because many producers in these countries buy their fabrics from Japan.
Both imported and domestic textile prices are rising. Prices for imported textiles are rising because of the decline in the value of the dollar (Japan and Europe) and because of quotas (Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan). Domestic prices are rising because demand is up and domestic textile mills are running near capacity.
Because of the lag between orders and shipments, several contacts have quite low shipment volumes. A couple have had small layoffs recently. Hiring is limited to replacement hiring; none of the firms contacted is increasing the size of its workforce. Capital spending levels are considered to be fairly high, although not necessarily higher than last year. On balance, manufacturing respondents have become a little more positive about the outlook for the next six months to a year.
