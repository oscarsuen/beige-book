Sales of domestic automobiles in Ohio grew at a slightly faster pace than those in the rest of the nation. Although dealers reported lower sales than last year, they have tried to avoid financial incentive programs, preferring to lure customers with package deals. Import dealers reported that sales in the area are keeping pace with the nation. Dealers indicated that modest price increases have reduced sales. They also have avoided financial incentive programs because they feel their profit margins are at the lowest acceptable levels.
Raw steel production in the region was up 26 percent in May from the previous month. This marks an increase of 12 percent since the beginning of 1987. With employment increasing by only 3 percent and average weekly hours roughly constant, much of the increase in output is attributable to higher labor productivity.
Regional employment projections for the third quarter of 1987 are generally optimistic. A greater number of employers expect to add workers than to reduce employment. Employment opportunities are predicted by durable and nondurable manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, the construction industry, and services. Staff reductions are forecasted in finance/insurance/real estate. Columbus, Dayton, and Akron report the most positive employment forecasts; Pittsburgh and Youngstown report the least positive.
