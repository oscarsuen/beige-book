The modest uptrend in the Second District economy continued in recent weeks. Most retailers had sales gains that were at or above plan, and residential construction remained strong. Business activity showed some improvement, and demand for office space was generally good. Small and mid-sized banks report that consumer loans continue weak, however, despite increasing attempts to attract borrowers.
In line with the Easter holiday and spring season, the items mentioned as most heavily in demand were adult apparel and various items for children. Most respondents reported that, as a result of recent sales activity, inventories remain on or close to plan. However, one retailer, who noted a slowing of sales momentum in May, described his inventories as "a little heavier than desired".
District unemployment rates of 4.2 percent in New Jersey and 4.8 percent in New York remain well below the United States average. However, some recent developments have elicited considerable concern about the District's employment outlook. A Labor Department study just released shows that from 1984 to 1987 manufacturing jobs declined much more rapidly here than nationwide. In addition, two major corporations announced plans to move their corporate headquarters and 6000 employees from the region over the next year or so. Much public discussion has ensued about what is needed to avoid the exodus of other major corporations as well as about the increased vulnerability of the District's economy due to its narrowing industry mix.
Office leasing activity in the Second District has continued at a good pace with reports of brisk demand in the midtown Manhattan market. Although the recently announced plans of Mobil and J.C. Penney to move their corporate headquarters from Manhattan mean the release of an additional three million square feet, the consensus seems to be that this can be accommodated with no real difficulty. A major new project getting underway is a $900 million complex of offices, condominiums, and stores in Jersey City. While the overall vacancy rate in northern New Jersey remains high, this project on the Hudson River is reportedly at a prime location because of its proximity to public transportation as well as New York City.
