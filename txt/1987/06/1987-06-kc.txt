Many savings institutions in the Tenth District have experienced weak deposit growth during the last year. Negative publicity about the FSLIC has dampened deposit inflows. Loan demand has fallen off since the April run-up in mortgage rates. Mortgage rates leveled off after their April increase, and most respondents believe that rates will remain near current levels in the near future.
Spring crop planting was generally finished ahead of schedule due to favorable weather across most of the district. Most areas report that 80 to 100 percent of the corn, milo and soybean crops are planted, and many fields are showing good early growth.
Feedlots in the Tenth District are generally full, reflecting strong returns to cattle production over the last year and the renewed rise in beef prices since the first of the year. Few feeders are expanding their feeding capacity, however, and cow-calf and stocker-cattle operations do not appear to be adding to their herds. Growers appear reluctant to expand herds at the current high cattle prices and some bankers, fearing a drop in the market, are loaning less on the collateral value of the cattle purchased. District hog producers have reacted to strong market conditions much the same as cattle producers. Hog prices have been favorable over the past year and particularly strong in 1987, but there is little evidence of expansion in hog operations. Though some bankers report a moderate increase in hog inventories in their areas, there has been no sign of investment in new facilities.
