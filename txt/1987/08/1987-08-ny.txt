Developments in the Second District economy varied somewhat among sectors during recent weeks. General business conditions continued to be stable or improved and office leasing remained good in most areas. Some slowing in residential construction activity occurred, however, and consumer spending was not uniformly on or above plan. Small and mid-sized banks reported a decline in primary mortgage rates during June and July.
Items for which there was good demand in June were apparel of all types, not just for Father's Day, and housewares, furniture and rugs. Inventories continue to be monitored closely and generally are on or slightly above target. One retailer whose chain has had higher-than-desired stocks in recent months plans an additional promotional In the near future to try to pare inventories.
Several recent developments point to a positive impact on the District's economy. The New York Times announced plans to spend $400 million, its largest capital investment ever, on a new printing plant in New Jersey. Estimated to be the size of 20 football fields, the plant will ease production constraints at existing sites and permit growth of the Sunday edition. Also in New Jersey, Governor Kean has just presented plans for a $200 million state center for the performing arts to be erected in Newark, plus expenditures of about $50 million on other performance facilities in the District. In another development, ground was recently broken in Manhattan for Shearson Lehman's new office tower which, upon completion, will house 1500 new employees together with 5000 workers currently employed by the firm.
Leasing activity in the District's commercial and industrial markets generally remains good. Among new undertakings, construction has begun on a large mixed-use office, residential and commercial complex at a four-acre site in mid-Manhattan which for many years had served as a parking lot. A major tenant has already been announced for the office skyscraper to be built there. While conditions have generally been good, some concern has been voiced recently regarding developments in Westchester County and northern New Jersey where office vacancy rates remain at 20% or above. Leasing activity in much of Westchester has been slow in recent months, and while northern New Jersey continues to attract new tenants, a spate of newly announced large office projects has raised the possibility of increasing vacancy rates.
