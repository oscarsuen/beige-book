Deposit growth at Tenth District savings institutions is reported weak for the first six months of 1987. More recently, there has been a slight improvement in savings inflows at institutions that have increased rates to levels comparable with commercial banks. Demand for mortgage funds is down, but respondents hope for slight improvement over the remainder of 1987. Mortgages rates have fallen off a little due to slack demand. Rates are expected to remain at about their current levels for the rest of 1987.
The corn, milo, and soybean crops are doing well throughout the district. Most district states have received good moisture and expect excellent harvest this year. There is some concern that the fall harvest may meet with isolated storage problems.
Feedlots generally remain full in the Tenth District as beef prices remain strong, but no expansion in capacity is reported. There are only scattered reports of herd expansion, as operators are generally holding steady. Hog prices remain high, but bankers report continuing fear of a downturn. Consequently, operators are somewhat hesitant to expand and bankers are reluctant to finance new facilities or large increases in inventories. There are, however, a few reports of small inventory increases.
