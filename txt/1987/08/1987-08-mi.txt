The district economy has continued to improve this summer. Strong seasonal employment growth has helped many parts of the district, causing a general decline in state unemployment rates. Consumer spending has grown modestly, while housing activity may be starting to pick up a bit again. The tourist industry, a major summer employer, has done well so far this summer. The agricultural sector has at least done better than last year, thanks to warm weather, high livestock prices, and income from government farm programs.
Motor vehicle sales seem to be picking up. One domestic manufacturer experienced its best June sales ever in this district. While its inventories are still a bit high, its dealer profits have been good. A large Twin Cities dealer of another domestic manufacturer reports that its recent sales have been quite good, too. Directors of this Bank's branch in Montana give mixed reports about auto sales in their hometowns.
Housing activity may have rebounded a bit recently. After a 22 percent drop in May, Minneapolis-St. Paul home sales posted a 9.5 percent gain in June over the level of June 1986. Sales for the second quarter were still around 20 percent lower than a year earlier, though.
