Upturns were evident in retail prices and wages from June to July. One-third of the retailers reported increases in the prices they charge and in employee compensation, as compared with negligible percentages reporting declines. Retailers were about evenly split between those reporting increases and those reporting no change in the prices they pay for goods at wholesale.
Retailers remain optimistic about sales in the months ahead, with almost two-thirds anticipating increases. Most expect wholesale and retail prices to rise further. Few, however, expect an increase in their employee numbers, even though over half currently report job openings. Evidently retailers are doubtful that they will be able to fill these positions, given the tightness of markets for service workers.
Coal production is above its year-ago level, but below the level predicted a few months ago. Export demand is weaker than had been anticipated, and electrical generating utilities are not buying at the expected rate.
Realtors in the District report that their sales of single family homes were unchanged in July from June. They expect mortgage interest rates to remain steady for three months, and then to rise.
FinancialLarge District banks report that consumer loan demand is strong this summer compared to last, and home equity loan demand is also strong. Commercial and industrial loan demand is mixed. Residential mortgage activity other than home equity loans is lower this summer. Variable rate mortgages that allow conversion to a fixed rate mortgage at the borrower's option—the so-called convertible ARMs—are being offered by only a few District banks, and only one bank reported strong customer interest.
Almost half of the banks surveyed reported out-of-the-ordinary additions to their loan-loss reserves. The increases were mostly due to foreign debt exposure and were expected to be one-time adjustments.
