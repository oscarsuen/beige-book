The Sixth District's economy shows signs of moderate strengthening in a number of sectors. Unemployment in the Southeast continues its downward trend assisted by sizable job gains in services and a slow rebound in manufacturing. Retail sales are rising moderately, and tourism is also providing a positive impact. Construction presents a mixed picture with pockets of brisk activity interspersed among slowing areas. Prospects in agriculture appeared generally favorable at mid-July although hot, dry weather again threatened crop yields.
The chemical industry is rebounding, aided by the weak dollar and low raw material costs. The recent upturn in oil prices has encouraged drilling activity, which has stimulated the oil equipment industry. Bank directors report that orders and shipments for furniture manufacturers remain strong, and consumer purchases of furniture are accelerating. Textile inventories are reported to be at acceptable levels, and many plants in the region are operating near capacity at present.
District car dealers report mixed trends for June and July as foreign car sales outperformed the sluggish movements of domestic cars. As in recent months, most dealers handling GM models report weak sales and unwanted inventory accumulation. One surprising bright spot emerged in New Orleans, where the stabilization of oil prices and renewed drilling activity spurred the best June car sales performance in that location in four years. Overall, the Southeast's new car registrations this year through the end of May were off by 1 percent compared to the first five months of 1986, while the nation's rate dropped by 9 percent.
Market performance varies throughout the District. Jacksonville reports strong sales, and new residential construction continues at a healthy pace in the suburbs of Jackson, Mississippi. The worst performance is reported in New Orleans, where sales are slow and prices are stagnant.
The Southeast's prolonged slowdown of commercial construction has enabled markets to firm slightly. Orlando reports a decline in vacancy rates for commercial space, and prices for industrial space in Atlanta are strong. Montgomery contacts note active commercial construction.
For the first half of 1987, District coal production was 11 percent less than the same period of 1986, and coal prices averaged 6 percent lower.
