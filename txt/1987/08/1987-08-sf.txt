Apparel production in the Los Angeles area reportedly exceeds last year's pace, although the uncertainty generated by the new immigration bill has created problems for some producers. For example, some small apparel firms are operating below full capacity due to labor shortages, while other southern California producers reportedly have moved their plant operations to Mexico to take advantage of easier access to low-priced labor.
Production and profitability in the Northwest lumber industry appear to be holding up despite concerns regarding the impact of higher interest rates. The low value of the dollar continues to make U.S. exports attractive on world markets. In addition, Northwest producers' competitive positions vis-a-vis Canada have been enhanced by the 15 percent tariff on Canadian lumber exported to the U.S. and by a recent increase in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. The industry continues to operate at or near capacity in Oregon, while strong Japanese demand for pulp is stimulating Alaska's timber industry.
The rise in rates has squeezed many banks' profit margins, and the decrease in buying activity has reduced mortgage fee income as well. Some larger banks have developed new mortgage products to boost demand. Innovations include lower mortgage fees, longer loan rate commitments, shorter maturities, balloon mortgages, bimonthly and biweekly payment plans, and ARMs that are convertible to fixed rates at some point early in the life of the mortgage.
