District manufacturing employment declined at a 3.3 percent rate in the March-May period with losses concentrated in Missouri auto production. It was recently announced that $563 million will be invested to expand a Louisville assembly plant and produce a new line of light trucks. The expansion will directly create several hundred jobs.
Reports indicate that price increases for imported goods have allowed expanded sales of regionally produced textiles and apparel, electronic parts and metal-cutting equipment. Continued cost-cutting and automation, however, are expected to slow employment increases in these industries. Employment in the region's textile and apparel sector leveled off in recent months following gains since last fall. Jobs in electrical and nonelectrical equipment have declined since 1985.
Despite the recent slowing, general construction activity remained stronger in the District than in the nation in the second quarter, due to the strength of the region's nonresidential sector.
The volume of farm operating loans continued to fall both at commercial banks and at Production Credit Associations during the first quarter of the year. Overdue farm loans at agricultural banks improved from 10.4 percent in the first quarter of 1986 to 9.0 percent one year later. Net loan losses at agricultural banks also improved from .28 percent to .20 percent over the same period.
