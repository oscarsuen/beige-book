Regional reports filed in late July show little change from those filed in mid-June and indicate continued moderate economic growth. Manufacturing activity is rising in most of the country, and the energy sector shows some signs of revival. Retail sales are still increasing. Price increases are more common at producer and consumer levels. Construction activity appears somewhat weaker than reported six weeks ago, primarily because of declines in homebuilding. Bank loan and deposit activities are mixed to slightly weaker than reported in June. The financial outlook for farmers has brightened.
The prices of apparel and certain other goods such as imported electronics continue to rise, and retail inventories are higher. Large stocks of goods in department stores have retailers somewhat concerned in the Boston and Dallas districts. Dealer inventories of new cars are up in Cleveland, Atlanta, and Minneapolis, but they are lower in Richmond and tight in Kansas City.
Three Reserve Banks see signs of a good summer tourist season. Atlanta notes increases in hotel occupancy rates, and both Minneapolis and San Francisco report heavy highway traffic.
Input prices may be rising faster. Reports from Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City all include references to price increases.
Nonresidential activity is mixed, St. Louis reports strong growth, but the San Francisco district is experiencing a severe downturn. Relatively stable activity is reported by New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas. Within these and other districts, however, are pockets of strength and weakness. New York indicates that commercial and industrial leasing activity is generally good but is threatened by overbuilding.
The financial position of agriculture is looking better in other ways. Richmond and Chicago observe upward pressure on farmland prices. The volume of farm operating loans is reported to be falling by St. Louis. Richmond reports lower interest rates for agricultural loans, and both Richmond and St. Louis are witnessing stronger loan repayment rates.
