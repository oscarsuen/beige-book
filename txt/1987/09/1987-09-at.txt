The pace of southeastern economic activity remains brisk in most sectors at the end of the summer. Employment in key regional industries continues to expand; residential construction activity has picked up, and office vacancy rates are expected to drop in some major regional markets. Although retailers' sales have slowed recently, recent dealer incentives have boosted auto sales. Port activity is benefiting from the weak dollar, and tourism has been strong throughout the region. Crop yields and profits are expected to outpace last year's drought-reduced levels.
Concentration on narrow, localized market niches has reduced import vulnerability of regional steel producers. Small mills have been adding to capacity and boosting productivity with improved technology. Lumber industry spokesmen are concerned about the multifamily building slowdown and the rise in mortgage interest rates; however, the tariff on Canadian lumber has helped to curb the tide of imports. Also, the surge in lumber use for home remodeling is helping to support the market.
Early August car sales in the District were boosted by new factory incentives featuring finance rates as low as 1.9 percent and generous cash rebates on 1987 models. Industry contacts reported a strong market response, particularly for some GM cars and trucks for which sales had been especially weak. Despite the sluggish sales of domestic autos, the District's new vehicle registrations in the first half of 1987 were off only 0.7 percent from last year, much less than the 7.9 percent drop nationally.
The Sixth District is attracting an increasing portion of foreign investment in U.S. commercial real estate. In both Atlanta and Miami, 18 percent of downtown commercial properties are owned by foreign investors, and this rate is expected to increase. Although no upward pressure in prices has yet occurred, the slowdown in construction in these overbuilt markets, coupled with the rising demand of foreign investors, is expected to increase prices, say contacts in these cities. Contacts in almost all District metropolitan areas expect increased foreign investment in the near future.
Office leasing in Miami is strong although vacancy rates are still high. Contacts there say they expect a 30 percent increase in leasing this year over last. Sales and leasing of industrial property in Atlanta remain very active, and the vacancy rate in the second quarter was again below the national average.
Yields of major crops in the region are expected to be much higher than last year's drought-reduced harvests. Production will be up despite reduced acreages this year. With prices and costs near those of a year ago, profit per acre should also improve moderately.
