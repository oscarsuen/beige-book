Economic growth in the Ninth District continues apace. Labor market indicators point to favorable employment conditions. While consumer spending didn't strengthen generally, tourist spending did. Mining activity has picked up, and improved agricultural conditions are likely to lead to higher farm income.
Sales incentives have increased purchases of motor vehicles recently. One domestic manufacturer reports that its district sales have been strong, with both car and truck sales up over 15 percent in August and its inventories down. Another domestic manufacturer reports that consumer response to its incentives has been brisk, and that increased farm income should help rural sales this fall. A director notes than in western Wisconsin some car dealers, who had been doing poorly, have recently been doing better.
Scattered reports indicate that district housing activity has been mixed. Home sales in Minneapolis were 14.7 percent lower in July than a year earlier, and single-family housing permits in Minneapolis-St. Paul were off a bit in June. But in other parts of the district, housing activity may be picking up. In North Dakota a newspaper editor reports that new home construction is booming in Fargo, while a business representative in Williston, notes that a glutted housing market has recently improved there. A director reports that orders for telephones were up lately, indicative of new home construction.
