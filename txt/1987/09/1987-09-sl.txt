Regional residential building continued to decline. The value of District residential contracts fell by 8.4 percent in the three months through July. Losses were concentrated in Missouri and Tennessee. Although weak recently, District residential contracts were up 7.1 percent in the May-July period compared with the same period a year earlier due to strong single-family building. A slight decline in residential building was posted nationally during the same period.
The office vacancy rate in the St. Louis metropolitan area increased to 16.4 percent in June from 13.6 percent a year before, but remained about 4 percentage points below the national metropolitan average. Area vacancy rates are expected to rise by the end of 1987 as a large volume of office space is completed. St. Louis' industrial vacancy rate of 5.4 percent was slightly below the 6.1 percent national average in June and down from 6.7 percent in June 1986.
Due to reduced acreage, large government payments to farmers, and lenders' restraint, the volume of farm loans outstanding at District commercial banks in June fell by over 15 percent from last year. The largest decline occurred in Kentucky where farm loans were off by 30 percent. Farm loan delinquencies and farm loan losses at agricultural banks improved in District states with the exception of Mississippi.
