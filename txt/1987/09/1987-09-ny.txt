Economic activity in the Second District continued to vary among sectors in recent weeks. General business conditions improved somewhat further, and office leasing was fairly good. Homebuilding activity displayed a mixed pattern, however, and July spending at some retailers was below plan. On the financial side, small and mid-sized banks expect only a mild increase in inflation over the near term.
Due to the somewhat disappointing sales gain in July, retailers reported inventories at higher levels than planned. An exception was the firm with a shortage of summer merchandise. None of the respondents reported inventories at uncomfortable levels, however.
Unemployment rates moved lower in both New York and New Jersey during July to 4.4 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively. Rates in most of the District's labor market areas are below the national average and in several instances have declined sharply since last year. In Elmira, for example, where some new plants have opened, the unemployment rate dropped from 6.1 percent to 3.6 percent over the year ended in June (latest data), while in Buffalo, the rate fell from 6.9 percent to 5.0 percent over the same period as 20,000 new jobs were added. The rebuilding of the Fort Drum military post now underway in northern New York State is providing a stimulus to Syracuse and several depressed economies in the upstate area.
Office leasing activity has been fairly good in much of the District, and in New York City, where the vacancy rate is already relatively low, a pickup has recently occurred in commitments for space in some new buildings. However, vacancy rates remain at 20 percent or above in areas such as Westchester and Fairfield counties and northern New Jersey. While office construction has virtually halted in Westchester, new buildings continue to come on line in Fairfield and New Jersey.
