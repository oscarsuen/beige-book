An Arizona survey suggests a broad-based decline in purchases and planned purchases of consumer durables in that state, consistent with the slowing pace of activity there. Consumer purchases since the last survey declined in most spending categories, but the proportion purchasing home appliances increased from 24 percent to 31 percent. The proportion planning to purchase automobiles during the next six months dropped from 42 percent of the respondents in July 1986 to 28 percent in July 1987, while the fraction planning to buy electronic products and tools dropped from 43 percent to 33 percent. Declines of 10 to 15 percentage points also were reported for household furnishings and home improvements, with home appliances experiencing a smaller decline.
Several respondents note that exports to both Europe and Japan have strengthened. A Washington banker argues that the improvement also is due to new product designs and redesigns of existing products reaching the production stage, and that continued improvement in this area depends critically on activity at large regional electronic and electrical equipment firms.
Some oil equipment firms finally are operating "in the black," as the number of drilling rigs has been increasing for the last eight to nine weeks. In Kern County, the number of drilling rigs has increased during each of the last four months, and 51.5 percent of the rigs are working, compared with only 27.5 percent of rigs a year ago.
Construction and Real EstateConstruction activity in the Twelfth District continues to be mixed, with particularly weak activity in economically struggling areas, and multifamily construction weakening throughout the District. In California, the number of residential construction permits year-to-date through July stands 11.5 percent below last year's level, while the value of nonresidential construction awards for the first seven months of the year remains 14 percent above the year-earlier level despite deterioration during June and July. The number of housing permits and mortgages in the Seattle area has declined in recent months, and sales of both new and existing homes have fallen in eastern Washington. In Utah, total construction value for the first six months of the year was down 15.7 percent from last year's level, after June declines of 25 percent in the number of new single-family construction permits and 45 percent in nonresidential valuation.
Many respondents attributed the general decline in consumer credit volumes to the new tax law, which eliminated consumer interest deductions, causing increased use of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. An Oregon bank reports that credit card debt has grown only minimally, and auto loans have been flat, while the use of home equity credit lines has increased by 17 percent in the last year. There is little evidence that consumers are drawing down savings accounts to purchase durable goods. One large California bank reports that its passbook savings volume has advanced significantly since December. A community bank in the San Joaquin Valley also reports increases in savings account balances, while one Arizona bank reports that its savings account balances are up 15 percent. However, contradictory evidence comes from a southern California Savings and Loan, where savings inflows have been weak for the last seven months.
