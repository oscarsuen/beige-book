Economic growth in the Ninth District may have picked up a bit late in 1986. Consumer spending was somewhat stronger than expected in December. Ongoing commercial projects have kept contractors busy. Major resource sectors have not deteriorated, and some may pick up. A few scattered bright spots have appeared in agriculture. But district states are still struggling with projected budget deficits.
In accord with the national trend, district sales of motor vehicles were also strong in December, as buyers rushed to take advantage or their last chance to deduct sales taxes from their federal taxable income. During the last 10 days of December, district sales of domestic manufacturers were 50.4 percent ahead of the comparable period in 1985. Due to this rush, one domestic manufacturer reports, its total sales for the whole month of December were "great," and it had low inventories of both cars and trucks left for January.
Lower interest rates have continued to fuel housing activity. Home sales in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area registered big gains late last year: They were 23 percent higher during November and December than during those months a year ago. Homebuilders contacted in Minnesota report statewide gains during 1986, but think a recent tariff on Canadian lumber may raise home prices a bit in 1987.
Tourist spending at district ski resorts has been spotty lately, due to scattered snowfall. Fortunately, the hard-pressed Upper Peninsula of Michigan has had a strong season so far, according to a Bank director. Resorts in Montana with adequate snow have benefited from Idaho's lack of snow.
