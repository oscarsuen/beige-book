The pace of economic activity appears to have quickened slightly at year-end, according to this month's commentaries on regional economic conditions. Retailers in most Districts enjoyed moderate year-over-year sales increases, in line with expectations. Auto sales were very strong in December, although the loss of the sales tax deduction in 1987 is widely regarded as the reason for this strength. Manufacturing employment increased in several Districts. The improvement was spotty, however, with an industry expanding in one District but not in another. Residential construction activity remains strong in some Districts, but has slowed in others. The rate of nonresidential construction also varies considerably from one part of the country to another. Oil and gas drilling is gradually increasing from very depressed levels. The agricultural situation is improving. While agricultural prices remain weak, higher production levels and lower prices for petroleum-based inputs are positive factors. Banks in most Districts experienced very strong commercial and real estate loan demand in December. Some of this strength is attributed to efforts to complete transactions before the new tax laws are in effect.
Retail inventories at the end of the Christmas season were said to be at comfortable levels and, in two or three Districts, lower relative to sales than in past years. For the most part, changes in exchange rates have not had much effect on retail prices, although merchants in several Districts expect rising import prices to show up more in 1987. Retailers are generally optimistic about future sales, but there is some concern that the first quarter will be soft as consumers start paying for the cars and other large items purchased late in 1986.
Reports of motor vehicle sales were all the same. Sales were very strong in December; dealers are generally satisfied with current inventory levels; sales are expected to be slow for at least the first several months of 1987. Most reports attribute the strength in December and the weakness projected for early 1987 to consumers' shifting purchases from 1987 to 1986 in order to take advantage of the deductibility of the sales tax. In this regard, San Francisco notes that in Oregon, where there is no sales tax, sales did not pick up appreciably.
Nonresidential construction levels vary from busy in Minneapolis and Chicago to slow in San Francisco. About half the Districts mentioned that some office markets face an oversupply of space; absorption rates are said to be strong in many areas, however. Similarly, in areas with newly constructed retail space, occupancy rates are improving. Construction for retail buildings has continued at a healthy rate in Atlanta, in part because of net in-migration. Substantial growth in nonresidential construction was reported in parts of the Chicago and St. Louis Districts.
Manufacturers in different Districts vary considerably in their views of the future. Those in the Philadelphia and Richmond Districts think that business will improve over the next six months, those in Boston foresee little change, and those in Cleveland expect the first quarter of 1987 to be very poor and are uncertain whether the national expansion will continue.
The number of oil and gas drilling rigs in operation increased in December in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts, but remains far below the number a year ago. Drilling in Atlanta was at its highest level since last spring. Coal production increased over the year in the Richmond District but decreased in Atlanta. Gold mining in the Minneapolis District is reported to be doing fairly well and the San Francisco District's copper industry is hiring after an extended period of layoffs.
Farm incomes are not as weak as farm prices in all cases, since production levels are higher. Good weather contributed to a bountiful vegetable and citrus harvest in Florida, more calves were held over the winter in the Kansas City District, and crop production in the Richmond District should be higher than this year's drought-reduced levels. On the down side, a significant decline in Texas cotton production projected for 1986 means lower incomes in already distressed areas of the state.
In the St. Louis District agricultural lending by banks continues to decline as a result of reductions in the costs of inputs and land, on the one hand, and more rigorous scrutiny by lenders, on the other. In the Kansas City District loan paydowns are reported to have improved over last year.
