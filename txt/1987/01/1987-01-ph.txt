The Third District economy appears healthy, although growth in several sectors has slowed recently. Manufacturing activity was only steady in January, following six consecutive months of expansion. Retail sales during the holiday shopping season met merchants' plans, which called for modest year-over-year gains, and they have been enjoying a healthy rate of sales since Christmas. Automobile sales were high in December but low in January. Total loan volume at major Third District banks was growing slowly as 1986 came to a close, although real estate lending remains strong.
Expectations for the Third District economy are generally positive. A majority of manufacturers polled in January predict steady or improving business during the first half of the year. Retailers also expect a good year, but express some concern that consumer debt burdens could limit discretionary spending. Automobile dealers say it will be several months before the slack following the December rush of car sales is reversed. Bankers expect business lending to parallel moderate economic growth in 1987, but they believe consumers will not be willing to add much to their current debt levels.
Industrial prices in the area are mostly stable; 80 percent of the firms contacted in January said both input and output prices were unchanged from December. However, 15 percent noted increased costs for the goods they purchase, and 12 percent charged more for their own products.
In their outlook for the first half of 1987, local manufacturers have mostly positive views. Forty-three percent of the January survey respondents expect continued growth and 38 percent anticipate steady conditions; only 15 percent forecast a slowdown. Overall, survey respondents expect increases in orders and shipments. They remain cautious, however, and are planning no changes in either employment or capital spending schedules during the next six months.
Retailers are optimistic that the healthy rate of sales so far in January indicates a good year ahead. However, some express concern that discretionary spending could lag, as consumers make payments on automobiles and other high-priced merchandise purchased late in 1986. Automobile dealers reported a sharp slowdown in sales in January, which they attribute to the shifting of purchases into 1986; they do not expect sales to pick up for several months.
Growth in consumer loan volume at major Third District banks tapered off during 1986, and near the end of the year consumer credit outstanding was approximately 10 percent above the December 1985 level. This is a continuation of a trend to slower growth in consumer lending that began in the second half of 1985. Local bankers generally believe that consumers are approaching the limit of their willingness to add to debt burdens. Nevertheless, home equity lending appears to be increasing, prompted by the new tax law and strong promotion by banks. A significant portion of this new lending reflects consolidation of bank and merchant credit card debt, however.
Residential real estate activity is strong. The average rate for 30-year fixed rate mortgages has fallen to around 9 percent in the region, and realtors say this enables a substantial number of buyers to afford homes for the first time. Consequently, sales and prices rose throughout 1986, and realtors expect this trend to continue. However, builders note increasing resistance to higher prices for newly constructed homes. One large mortgage lender is predicting a 10 percent decline in housing starts in the region this year, but most builders think this is an overly pessimistic view.
