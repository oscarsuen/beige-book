Conditions in most sectors of the Second District economy were stable to improved in recent weeks. Consumer spending during the holiday season was at or above expectations and inventories were generally low going into the new year. Residential construction remained strong, in part because of mild weather. An increased number of firms however, reported a worsening of business conditions, although the majority continues to experience stability or improvement. On the financial side, lending activity increased substantially during late 1986 at mid-sized banks in the District.
Among items in strong demand were apparel, jewelry and electric appliances. In addition, a new laser toy proved so popular that stores could not keep it in stock. As the new year began, most stores reported inventories at quite comfortable levels.
Employment remains at a record level in the District as declines in manufacturing have continued being offset by gains in other sectors. Moreover the December unemployment rates of 4.3 and 6.0 percent in New Jersey and New York, respectively, were below the national average. However, a development that could have an adverse impact on District employment is A.T.& T's recently announced plans for a 27,400 reduction in its workforce by the end of 1987. While no information was given as to where the cutbacks would occur, some 67,000 of the company's employees are in the New York-New Jersey area.
Office market conditions were relatively stable in recent weeks with few major new projects undertaken. Additional leasing activity continues to help in areas of oversupply. Moreover, some observers anticipate an actual tightening of the office market on Long Island because of the unabated demand and limited construction activity there. In Manhattan, opinions are mixed concerning the likely impact of the recent collapse of rental negotiations for the last of the World Trade buildings. Some anticipate a sizable increase in the downtown vacancy rate as these 2 million square feet of new office space re-enter the market, but others believe it can be absorbed without much difficulty.
