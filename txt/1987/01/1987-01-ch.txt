Activity has been sluggish in the Seventh District, but construction and retail sales have been surprisingly vigorous. Growth of total employment in the District continues to be less than in the U.S.; however, manufacturing employment rose recently, after an extended decline. Other steel makers continue to benefit from the 5 1/2-month strike at USX. Auto output has been cut back modestly, from high levels. Most lines of mechanical capital goods remain weak, reflecting limited demand from both domestic buyers and overseas, including less developed countries that had been good customers. Construction in major markets in the District continues vigorous. An expected slowing in offices and apartments is not yet evident.Consumer spending improved in November and December, through a broad range of products.
