Domestic automobile sales were up as much as 50 percent over sales a year ago. Most of the increase is reportedly due to changes in the tax laws. Consequently, sales so far in 1987 have been weak. One dealer commented that sales were the slowest in 4 years. Since most dealers anticipated the year-end rush, inventories are reported to be at "comfortable" levels.
Import dealers reported similar sales volumes. Some foreign car dealers feared that a weak dollar may result in price increases for cars produced abroad.
First quarter 1987 projections by the Manpower Incorporated Employment Outlook Survey suggest that this region's employment growth will be slower than the nation as a whole. However, three of the largest cities in the District have outlooks better than those of the nation. These include Pittsburgh, Columbus and Cincinnati. Employment increases are expected services, wholesale/retail and durable manufacturing, while job losses are expected in finance, insurance and real estate.
Steel production in Ohio fell by 3 percent during November, approximately the same rate of decrease as U.S. production. However, since November of 1985, steel production increased 8 percent in Ohio while falling 20 percent nationwide. Consequently, Ohio's share of total tonnage produced in the U.S. rose from 15 percent to 20 percent over the last year. LTV recently announced intentions to spend $500 million over the next two years to improve its flat-rolled steel division.
Uncertainty about the ability to sustain the recovery much longer and the effects of tax reform have generated pessimism among business executives, especially in Northeast Ohio. Respondents of a recent survey expected the first quarter of 1987 to be the worst in three years. Twenty percent of businesses surveyed reported unplanned expenditures in 1986:IV in order to take advantage of the old tax laws, and the same percentage indicated cut backs in spending plans in 1987 because they lost investment incentives. In addition, a record high percentage (20 percent) of business executives expected no profits in the first quarter of 1987.
The consensus among those interviewed is that mortgage rates will decline during the first half of 1987, but will rise slowly during the second half. Lenders report keen competition for mortgages and have been forced to drop interest rates. They are partially offsetting the lower rates by charging higher points. Mortgage refinancings are a small proportion of current volume, but most lenders expect another wave of refinancings if mortgage rates decline another 50 to 75 basis points.
However, loan demand may soften in the next few months as both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing companies surveyed have reported that outside financing is considered unlikely in the next few months.
