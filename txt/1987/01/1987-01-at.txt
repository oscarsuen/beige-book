Economic growth in the Southeast continues at a moderate pace. Service employment gains are strong. but manufacturing job gains are weak. Holiday spending was checkered because oil patch weakness somewhat offset gains in areas benefiting from strong population and income growth. Home building's momentum may be slowing, and weakness in office building is causing overall commercial construction to shrink. Tourism continues to boost the regional economy. In agriculture, bountiful crops depressed vegetable prices and grower profits but raised revenues for citrus producers.
Manufacturing activity has registered little overall change for most sectors since September. Although textile and apparel imports were at record levels in 1986, mergers, consolidations, and the closing of inefficient mills have resulted in a more productive and competitive domestic textile industry. Mills are running at 92 percent of capacity, up 9 percent from last year, and textile employment has turned up. Labor-intensive apparel producers are bearing the brunt of import competition; apparel employment is down by 7,900 workers just in the last year.
Appliance producers report record levels of shipments due to the strong housing market. Printing and publishing companies have been adding to job rolls as savings and loans, brokerage houses, and banks offer new financial services that require checks and documentation. The transportation equipment sector continues to add jobs on the strength of auto sales and aircraft parts production. Weakness in energy drilling activity continues to batter Louisiana; employment in oil and gas extraction fell by about 22,600 workers last year.
District car sales rebounded sharply in December from the sluggish pace of October and November, largely in response to the well-advertised sales tax deduction advantage of purchasing a new vehicle before January 1987. Ford Motor Company's sales in the Southeast soared 45 percent in December, matching the company's strong car sales growth nationally. For all of 1986, Ford sales in the Southeast and the nation were off 3.3 and 0.2 percent from 1985 levels. Because fewer incentives are available to maintain consumer interest, the 1987 car sales outlook is uncertain.
Although overall commercial construction is slowing, retail construction has continued at a healthy pace, spurred by continuing population in-migration. Occupancy rates are high at new shopping centers in Birmingham and Atlanta, and few lease rate concessions are being given. In Tampa, a slowdown in retail construction has helped boost occupancy rates and effective lease rates, while new store openings have caused a glut in New Orleans. Industrial construction over the past year has been strongest region-wide in the high-tech office and warehouse space segment.
Extremely favorable weather in late 1986 over much of Florida's vegetable producing area has resulted in a bountiful winter harvest, especially of tomatoes. Unfortunately, vegetable prices reportedly are below production cost for many growers. Florida's citrus farmers are faring better with a larger crop than last season because prices are holding up better.
