District nonresidential construction contracts grew by 6.5 percent in the September-November period, nearly matching the nation's 6.3 percent expansion. Compared with year-ago levels, however, District contracts for the period were 11.2 percent higher in contrast to a 5.7 percent decline nationally. Missouri was responsible for much of the District's construction growth with the value of residential and nonresidential contracts issued in the three-month period up 27.3 and 34.1 percent, respectively, from year-ago levels.
The quality of farm loans, as measured by non-performing farm loans, has continued to deteriorate both in the nation and the District. Loan losses at District agricultural banks, however, have stabilized while they continue to increase at the national level.
