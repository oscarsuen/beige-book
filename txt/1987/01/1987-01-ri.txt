Seventy percent of responding retailers report no change in the prices of the goods they sell or in the cost of goods they buy. Among the remaining 30 percent, those reporting price increases outnumber those reporting declines.
The manufacturing outlook also appears to be improving. Among, respondents, 35 percent report increases in new orders and 25 percent report declines. In the previous survey, increases were reported by 25 percent, declines by 26 percent. Unfilled orders also appear to be rising.
Looking ahead, manufacturers continue to anticipate increases in shipments and new orders. In our latest survey, about two-thirds indicate that they expect increases in these categories, compared with about half in the previous survey. Fifty-nine percent of the respondents believe general business conditions in the nation will be better six months from now; this percentage rose in January after declining in each of the three previous surveys.
Manufacturers' inventories of finished goods were apparently rising in early January, a change of direction from the four previous surveys. Higher inventory levels in January as compared with December are reported by 30 percent of the respondents; 20 percent report lower levels. In the previous survey, 26 percent had reported higher levels, and 43 percent had reported lower levels. Manufacturers' inventories of materials, however, appear to have declined for the fifth consecutive survey.
Regional coal production was slightly higher in mid-December then a year ago. Coal producers are cautiously optimistic about their sales in 1987 because they are less worried about the impact of possible acid rain legislation on demand, they expect buyers to stockpile coal this year because of the threat of a strike early in 1988, and they expect to compete better with foreign coal suppliers. Increased coal production will probably not result in more jobs for coal miners, however, because of advanced mining technology.
Regional forecasters are about evenly split between those who expect their state and local governments to increase real purchases significantly and those who expect little change in economic stimulus from their state and local governments.
