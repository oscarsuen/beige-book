Reports indicate that end-of-year auto sales were strong in most parts of the West, largely due to the elimination of sales tax deductions. Some respondents reported particularly dramatic year-end sales surges for luxury automobiles. In Oregon, which has no sales tax, little change in activity at the end of the year was reported. Most observers agree that the year-end sales spurt borrowed from next year so sales during the first few months of 1987 are expected to be slow. Evidence regarding the impact of tax reform on the purchase of other consumer durables is more mixed, as some respondents reported significant effects but most reported little discernable year-end activity.
The electronics and semiconductor industries continue to suffer the consequences of weak demand, fierce competition, and resulting low prices. For example, one Utah company recently announced a layoff of just over 10 percent of its employees. Many companies throughout the District lost money in 1986.
Single-family construction activity continues to fare much better because the reductions in interest rates already seen have made housing more affordable. No tax related changes have been seen or are expected in single family home building.
Mortgage lending volume fell towards the end of 1986 in some areas, but remained very strong in California. Through the first ten months of 1986, California savings and loans had closed 50 percent more mortgage loans than they had during the same period of 1985, and loan commitments for October suggested that the trend was likely to continue through the end of the year. Thus, resale activity remained strong even though housing starts declined over the same period. In addition, some lenders report that home equity loans are becoming more popular as borrowers seek to deduct their interest payments.
