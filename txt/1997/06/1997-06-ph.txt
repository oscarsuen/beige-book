Economic activity in the Third District appeared to be improving slightly in some sectors but just holding steady in others in late May.  Manufacturers reported some increases in shipments and orders, and bankers said lending was moving up slowly.  Most retailers reported steady sales in recent weeks at a rate just even with last year's pace, although some large stores were posting year-over-year gains.  Auto dealers said sales of both domestic and imported cars declined during the past month.  Construction activity has shown little change recently, according to builders in the region.  Commercial rents have moved up somewhat since the beginning of the year and vacancy rates have edged down.  Residential real estate agents indicated that sales were continuing at a good pace but below the average for the first three months of the year.  Builders and real estate agents said prices for both new and existing homes were mainly level.
There were scattered reports of rising input prices, mainly in the nondurable goods sectors, but most of the firms reporting on prices said both input costs and the prices of their own products have been steady.  Manufacturers said prices are being kept in line by strong domestic and foreign competition.  They also indicated that outsourcing and other rationalization efforts are continuing as firms seek to reduce operating costs at all stages of production.
Auto dealers said sales of both domestic and imported cars have declined in the past month.  Dealers believe the slowdown will be temporary and that sales for the rest of the year will move above the level of last year's second half.  Although manufacturers have been increasing incentives to boost sales, dealers in the District generally said their inventories were not high.
Residential builders generally reported steady sales at rates equal to the year-ago pace or higher.  Several noted some slowing from the sales rate set in the first quarter, but most of those contacted for this report do not expect sales to slip below last year's level.  In some popular areas builders have raised prices, but for the region as a whole there does not appear to be a general increase in new home prices.  Residential developers have stepped up their acquisition of land in areas where new home sales have been strong.  Real estate agents said sales of existing homes have been running above last year's rate since January, but the year-over-year gain has eased in the past month.  While homes appear to be staying on the market for shorter periods, a large inventory of homes for sale in most parts of the District has been limiting price appreciation.
