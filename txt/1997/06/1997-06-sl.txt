The District economy continues to grow at a steady, sustainable pace.  Although retailers report varied results for April and May, with unseasonably cool weather slowing sales of summer clothes, most expect sales to pick up as summer arrives.  Car dealers have noticed a general slowing in sales recently, which they expect will continue for the rest of the year.  District firms, for the most part, are still reporting moderate gains in sales and employment, although tight labor markets in some areas continue to stall expansion plans.  Relative to a year earlier, a slightly smaller percentage of District small businesses plan to increase prices during the next three months.   Meanwhile, these small businesses report facing pressure on wages and salaries similar to a year ago.  While levels of sales and construction in residential and nonresidential real estate markets are continuing their upward trend, they are still below last year's record levels.  A cool, wet spring has retarded the growth of crops in many areas.
Most surveyed automobile dealers report a slowing in sales for April and May compared with one year ago.  Because of this slowdown, many have offered more frequent rebates to move stock.  Dealers report that relatively more buyers are purchasing new cars rather than used cars.  Dealers are somewhat pessimistic about car sales for the rest of 1997, however, expecting it to be a "soft" year.
To supply the soon-to-open Toyota plant in Indiana, a new aluminum smelting plant will open in eastern Missouri next year.  Several firms that supply materials to building contractors have recently seen sales increase as construction has picked up.  One of these suppliers notes that he was able to pass along a 3 percent price increase, which seems to be sticking, to his customers.
On the other hand, a maker of ice cream and other frozen products has seen sales slip recently because of unusually cool weather.  Public utilities have also seen usage fall below last year's levels because of cool weather.  One contact remarked, though, that on a weather-adjusted basis, usage is most likely up slightly.
According to a survey of 223 small businesses in the District, about 18 percent plan to boost sales prices over the next three months, while only about 3 percent plan to lower prices.  Last year, a similar survey showed that 21 percent planned to increase prices.  The same survey shows little change in wage pressures compared with a year earlier, with a little more than a fifth planning to boost wages and salaries over the next three months.  In contrast, less than 1 percent plan to reduce compensation ? again, roughly unchanged from a year earlier.
