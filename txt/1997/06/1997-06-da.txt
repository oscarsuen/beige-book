The Eleventh District economy continued to expand at a modest pace in May and early June. Reports suggested that labor markets had tightened since the last Beige Book, pushing up wages, but price reports were mixed. The strongest economic growth was reported by business service firms and in the energy sector. Growth of sales in manufactured products was up slightly, and construction activity continued to grow at a modest rate. Retailers said sales growth had downshifted since the last Beige Book but was "not terrible." Demand for financial services was unchanged, but contacts expressed concern about an oversupply of loanable funds. Agricultural production was hampered by excessive rainfall.
