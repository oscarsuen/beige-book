Economic growth in the Fifth District remained brisk in May, although a few sectors showed some deceleration.  The manufacturing and service sectors continued to grow rapidly, while retail trade lost some of its vigor of earlier months.  Commercial real estate activity increased further, and sources said that growth in residential real estate was mixed.  Driven by stronger demand, bank lending edged up after several lackluster months.  In agriculture, May's unseasonably cool and dry weather slowed crop development and hampered planting activity.  Overall price pressures were less pronounced, and despite tighter labor markets, fewer reports of wage pressures were received.
