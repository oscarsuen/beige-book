The district economy continued to grow moderately last month.  Manufacturing activity remained strong, retail sales edged up, and energy activity improved further.  The only sign of weakness was a slight slowdown in construction activity.  In the farm economy, the condition of the winter wheat crop ranged from average to very good, the outlook for spring crops was excellent, and the recovery in the cattle industry continued.  Labor markets remained tight in much of the district, and some companies increased wages for entry-level workers.  Prices generally held steady at the retail level while increasing for some construction materials.
Most respondent banks left their prime lending rates unchanged last month, but some expect to raise rates in the near term.  Most banks did not change their consumer lending rates and anticipate no future changes.  A few banks tightened their lending standards, citing concerns over credit quality.
District cattle feedlots are full.  The large numbers of cattle on feed are putting downward pressure on prices for fat cattle.  To keep from being caught with large numbers of cattle if prices fall, feedlot operators are marketing cattle at lighter weights.  Prices for feeder calves have remained high, leading district ranchers to sell their yearling calves this spring rather than keep them on grass through the summer.  Ranchers do not plan to increase their herd sizes by retaining additional replacement heifers this year.
The strong farm economy is benefiting many of the district's rural communities.   Bankers reported strong farm equipment and auto sales in the first half of the year.  Most other main street businesses are also benefiting from the stronger farm economy, and business conditions are stronger than a year ago.
