In late spring, the Ninth District economy continues to enjoy moderate growth in most sectors with few economic problems reported by any source.  Construction firms describe a fifth consecutive busy season, with strong residential and heavy construction reported in many areas.  Retail sales of general merchandise and vehicles are brisk according to most reports, and summer tourism and recreation business is apparently off to a good start.  Manufacturing firms continue to report good sales with few supply bottlenecks.  Iron mining and oil production are strong, while forest product output is largely steady.  Although crop planting and development have been somewhat retarded, the overall outlook is favorable.  Beef producers are receiving higher prices, bringing relief to beleaguered ranchers and their lenders.  Hog prices have risen, with strong export demand and reduced numbers on farms, and some packers face difficulty in procuring enough hogs to keep slaughter lines running at capacity. Unemployment rates remain low in most regions, and employment numbers high.  Product prices show little increase.
A few problems are visible.  Many firms report some degree of wage pressure, and some are unable to find all the qualified workers they need.  Corrugated cardboard manufacturers have slowed production in response to low prices.  Areas of the Red River Valley in Minnesota and North Dakota continue to clean up after flooding, and output remains below usual levels for many firms in the Grand Forks metropolitan area.
Markets for existing real estate are also brisk.  "It's really a sellers' market," says one St. Paul suburban residential realtor.  Commercial property rental markets also are active.
Ranchers reportedly are optimistic about prices after three difficult years, and pasture conditions have improved in recent weeks.  Montana bankers indicate that their ranch customers should do somewhat better this year than last.  Hog prices have increased, in large measure due to export demand from Asia, and packers report difficulty in securing enough hogs to keep kill facilities running at efficient levels.  One packer in Sioux Falls, S.D., is temporarily laying off one shift due to difficulty in securing enough hogs.
"It seems like there's a lot more people in the market this year than last," comments the general manager of a Minneapolis area car dealership.  Other cities around the district also have generally strong auto sales, but in rural areas or smaller towns, sales reports vary greatly with specific local economic conditions.
Despite unpleasantly cool weather for the Minnesota fishing opener, camps, parks, and resorts report generally good business early in the season.  Inquiries are up in some states, and tourist operators are generally in a positive frame of mind.
In contrast to labor markets, where reports of wage pressures are common, few price increases are evident.  One manufacturer noted that supplies of chlorine and plastic resins are tight and their prices up, but said the impact of this was partially offset by declines in the cost of packaging.  Fuel prices continue 5 cents per gallon below year-ago levels.
