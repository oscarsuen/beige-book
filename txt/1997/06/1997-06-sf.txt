Twelfth District contacts reported strong economic performance in the most recent survey period, with evidence of tightening capacity constraints in several sectors.  Manufacturing activity expanded further in the District, with aerospace and related products leading the way, although demand growth slowed for some other products.  Service providers continued to do very well, and demand conditions and inventories in retail trade generally were acceptable.  Residential and commercial real estate markets were active and healthy in most areas.  However, widespread shortages of skilled labor continued, and several respondents noted emerging difficulties in filling entry level jobs.  Despite tight supply lines for some intermediate products, upward pressure on final prices of goods and services was tempered by robust competition.
Conditions in District service industries remained top-notch.  Demand for telephone and cable television services was strong.  Investment in high-tech capital equipment has been rapid in  most service industries in the District, although some respondents noted that high levels of spending in the past and current factors such as industry restructuring have served to moderate growth of expenditures on new computer equipment.  Hotel occupancy was high and room rates rose in the coastal Pacific Northwest and in Utah's Salt Lake City area.  Other reported service prices, such as those for electricity and cable television, remained relatively stable.
Increasing construction costs due to rising materials prices and a shortage of skilled construction labor reportedly contributed to home price appreciation in many areas of the District.  In the Portland, Oregon area, demand for new homes is strong and land costs have risen substantially.  Although housing starts have slowed in Utah, increased nonresidential construction reportedly has put pressure on already tight markets for construction labor.
