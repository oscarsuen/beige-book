The Fifth District economy expanded at a faster rate in March and early April, with growth balanced across nearly all sectors.  Led by a surge in shipments, manufacturing activity bounced back, posting its strongest showing since October.  Retail sales were robust, and the service sector grew more rapidly.  Activity in commercial real estate and tourism strengthened, while drier weather enabled farmers to resume tillage and planting.  Bank lending slowed, and realtors and homebuilders provided conflicting reports about activity in the housing sector.  Labor markets remained tight, with continuing wage pressures and shortages of qualified workers.  Prices continued to increase only slightly, with the notable exception of a sharp rise in building materials prices.
