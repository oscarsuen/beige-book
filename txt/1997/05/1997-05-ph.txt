Business conditions in the Third District were mixed in April.  Manufacturing activity edged up slightly during the month.  Retail sales slipped from March, although the year-to-year comparison was positive.  Auto sales also fell in April and dropped below the year-ago level as well.  Bankers generally reported steady loan volumes in April; a rise in business lending offset a decline in consumer lending.
Demand for technical workers remained strong throughout the District, and employers said salaries for these jobs were rising strongly.   In contrast, overall employment appeared to be growing moderately, and firms in a wide range of industries expect wage increases to average around 3 percent this year.
Business firms in the District report that prices are mainly steady, although manufacturers have noted some recent increases in the cost of inputs.  Retailers have seen some scattered increases in costs but do not report a general rise in wholesale prices.  Contacts at businesses of all kinds said they were continuing to give their attention to cost-containment measures in all phases of their firms' operations.
Looking ahead, the consensus among the District's manufacturers is that activity will continue to move up during the next two quarters.  Nearly half of the firms surveyed for this report forecast increased shipments and new orders, while only one in ten anticipate decreases.   On balance, firms expect to meet the rising demand without any significant increase in order backlogs, although they plan to add employees and increase working hours.
Auto dealers throughout the District noted a slowdown in sales in April compared with March and with April of last year.  Demand for domestic autos was generally reported to have dropped significantly below expectations, and light truck sales were also down, although not by as much.  Sales of imports have fared relatively better, although sales of some makes were weaker than dealers had anticipated.  In response to slowing sales, some domestic manufacturers have instituted or expanded rebate programs.
The increase in business lending posted in April came largely from new borrowing by existing customers, especially middle market companies, according to bank lending officers.  Bankers said the borrowing has been by firms in a wide variety of industries that are purchasing new equipment and making improvements in their facilities in order to cut costs and expand their operations.
