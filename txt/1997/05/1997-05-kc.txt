The district economy continued to grow moderately last month.  Manufacturing activity remained strong, retail sales edged up, and energy activity improved slightly.   Construction activity generally held steady.  In the farm economy, a recent cold snap  caused some damage to the winter wheat crop, but the district cattle industry continued to improve.  Labor markets remained tight in much of the district, yet reports of wage increases in the past month were scattered.  Prices generally held stable at the retail level while increasing for some materials used in manufacturing and construction.
All respondent banks increased their prime lending rates last month and about half expect to raise rates further in the near term.  Most banks also increased their consumer lending rates last month but plan no further changes in the near future.   Lending standards were unchanged.
The district's mix of major crops may change slightly this spring due to the new farm bill.  Under the new government farm program, farmers are free to plant what they want.  Bankers indicate that the recent surge in soybean prices is encouraging many district farmers to switch some acres from corn to soybeans.  In drier areas of the district, farmers aim to plant more milo and sunflowers than they have in the past.
Conditions in the district cattle industry continue to improve.  Most producers indicate that the herd reduction phase of the current cattle cycle may be over.  In fact, ranchers plan to retain more breeding stock this year to build their herds in preparation for stronger livestock profits in the years ahead.  The increased demand for breeding stock has nearly doubled the price of a cow and her newborn calf from a year ago.
