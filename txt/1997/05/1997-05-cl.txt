Business conditions in the District remain strong overall, consumer and business optimism appears high, and business expansion plans are above last year's increase.  Construction activity has strengthened noticeably in the past few months.  New housing and commercial construction are both much improved, despite generally poor weather.
Employment is growing, but at a somewhat subdued pace relative to the national average.  Presumably, extremely low rates of unemployment--often less than 4 percent--in many areas of the Fourth District are creating staffing problems.  In a sample of the District's smaller employers, contacts cited increased training costs and high worker turnover associated with tight labor markets.  One contact reported offering bonuses to employees who bring in new employees.
Demand has risen for workers of all skill levels, particularly those with technical backgrounds, and wage growth is higher than this time last year.  Respondents also report an increased frequency of job vacancies.  Several temporary employment agencies, specializing in high-skill areas such as law, engineering, and healthcare, have recently emerged.
Industrial price increases vary by commodity, but in the aggregate, prices appear unchanged.  Significant price increases are seen for a variety of metals, particularly steel.  Still, manufacturers report difficulty making price increases stick for finished goods.
Although still a relatively small share of the total retail market, on-line retailers' sales (retail sales through the Internet) have been growing at an incredible rate, with the approximate number of these "virtual" retailers doubling in the past year.  Industry sources indicate that exports account for about one-third of on-line retail business.  Virtual retailers are not exempt from labor shortages; respondents report difficulty finding customer-oriented workers with an understanding of new technology.
Inventory levels are reported to be at, or perhaps slightly above, desired levels, with the usual shortages of a few popular models.  While most dealers expressed optimism about the remainder of the spring sales season, a few indicated a desire to keep inventories "cautiously lean."  Dealers expressed little concern over the impact of recent supplier strikes on product availability.
The majority of District bankers contacted report a slight drop in the number of delinquencies since the first of the year.  However, several also noted a continued rise in  personal bankruptcies.  Commercial loan quality is high and predicted to remain strong as long as the economy maintains its current course.  Despite tight margins and rigorous competition, District banks have reported that first quarter profits were, on average, slightly above their expectations.
