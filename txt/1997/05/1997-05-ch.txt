The Seventh District economy expanded at a moderate rate in March and April, regaining some of the lost momentum noted in our last report.  Retail sales remained above year-ago levels but results varied by retailer and product line.  Residential housing activity picked up slightly from a weather-related slump early this year and business construction remained strong.  Manufacturing activity increased from earlier in the year despite several auto plants being idled by strikes.  Business lending remained strong while reports on consumer credit were mixed.  The District's labor markets remained very tight with continued shortages, but there was no new evidence of upward wage pressures.  Cool, wet weather conditions slowed early field work on farms while lagging inventories and growing export prospects buoyed hog prices.
