Economic growth in the Second District has slowed from the brisk pace noted in the last report, while prices continue to be stable.  Consumer spending appears to have slowed considerably since the last report, with retailers reporting that sales were generally below plan in March and April; some of this weakness was attributed to unseasonably cold weather.  Commercial real estate markets continued to tighten throughout the New York City area in the first quarter, though rental rates have risen only modestly.  Existing home sales slowed in February and March; however, new construction activity continued to edge up, and contacts in New Jersey report a boom in home remodeling activity.  Regional purchasing managers' reports suggest some weakening in the manufacturing sector and generally stable prices in March.  Finally, local banks report a pickup in loan demand and some improvement in delinquency rates.
While most retailers continue to report that inventories are on plan, a few now say stocks are on the high side.  Both retail selling prices and merchandise costs remain steady.  There has been no evident increase in retail wage pressures, although one contact noted increased difficulty in finding qualified managers.
Commercial real estate markets strengthened further in the first quarter.  Office vacancy rates continued to fall across most of the New York City area.  Midtown Manhattan's rate fell from 13.2 percent in late January to 12.3 percent (a 10-year low) at the end of March, with leasing activity described as "torrid".  Downtown's rate fell from 22.4 percent to 21.1 percent.  Similarly, vacancy rates in Westchester and Fairfield counties and northern New Jersey fell to new cyclical lows in the first quarter, while Long Island's rate held steady at a 9-year low.  Over the past year, rental rates on Class A properties have increased by 5 percent or less throughout the New York City metropolitan area.
The region's labor markets generally tightened in early 1997, despite recent announced cutbacks by large employers, such as Bausch and Lomb and AT&T.  In the first quarter, unemployment insurance claims were down about 10 percent from a year ago in both New Jersey and New York State.  New Jersey's unemployment rate fell to a cyclical low of 5.5 percent in March, after hovering above 6 percent throughout 1996.  However, New York's rate held steady at 6.3 percent, the same as last year's average.  Despite fairly strong job growth, New York City's unemployment rate climbed to a three-year high of 9.7 percent in March, due to a flood of new labor force entrants (the city's labor force has expanded at a 3 percent annual pace since mid-1995).
Interest rates increased on all categories of loans?especially for residential mortgages, where over 80 percent of banks surveyed reported higher rates.  Average deposit rates also rose.  Delinquency rates on consumer loans and residential mortgages, which had been on the rise, declined slightly in the latest survey; delinquency rates continued to abate for commercial and industrial loans and held steady for nonresidential mortgages.
