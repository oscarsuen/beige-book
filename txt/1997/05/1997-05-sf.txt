Reports from Beige Book contacts indicate continued strong growth in most Twelfth District states through the first quarter of 1997, with the exceptions being Alaska and Hawaii.  District retailers reported healthy first quarter sales, and service providers, particularly those in the tourism sector, noted continued rapid expansion. Manufacturing activity in the District remained strong, propelled by a booming aerospace industry and steady expansion in high-technology equipment manufacturing.  Increased demand for residential and non-residential real estate continued to boost construction activity in much of the District.  Respondents' generally favorable views of the economy were tempered by reports of material and labor shortages, particularly in construction and high-technology manufacturing.  Tight labor markets reportedly have prompted some businesses to sponsor job fairs to attract potential employees.
Service industry respondents in most District states continued to report solid growth. Providers of telecommunication services reported steady demand for their products, although equipment delivery delays are beginning to constrain activity.  Respondents from California, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah reported brisk demand for tourism-related services, keeping hotel occupancy rates high, particularly in San Diego, Las Vegas, and Portland.  In the Salt Lake City area the winter "room crunch" eased slightly with the close of the region's ski season, but conventions and other tourism activity continue to keep occupancy rates above year-ago levels.  In contrast, contacts in Hawaii reported a drop in tourism activity as international tourist traffic declined in response to a strengthening dollar.
Commercial construction activity was strong in most parts of the District.  In the Pacific Northwest commercial vacancy rates continued to drop, fueling an already booming nonresidential construction market.  Industrial construction activity in the Pacific Northwest also increased as manufacturing firms continued to demand new facilities.  In Utah, infrastructure projects such as the rebuilding of Interstate 15 and the development of a light rail system are augmenting the fast-growing commercial construction sector.  In California, respondents report rapid declines in commercial vacancy rates in the San Francisco Bay Area and rental prices are increasing.  However, speculative commercial construction activity remains weak.  In Los Angeles, commercial vacancy rates also are declining, although they remain above those for the state as a whole.
