The Southeastern economy continues to expand moderately in midwinter, according to most contacts.  Merchants report satisfactory sales and inventory accumulations, but they are cautious regarding spring sales and anticipate only marginal increases from a year ago.  Contacts report  increasing  manufacturing activity for most sectors, although weakness persists for some apparel and textile producers.  Tourism and convention activity continues at high rates, and officials report strong spring bookings.  Reports on single-family home sales remain mixed, while commercial real estate markets are improving, and new development is accelerating.  Bankers note moderate loan demand with quality improvements reported throughout the District.  Although low unemployment rates in parts of the District are making it difficult for some employers to find qualified workers, wage increases have been relatively stable, according to most contacts.  A late January freeze damaged crops in Florida, but the citrus crop was mostly spared.
Contacts generally report that commercial real estate markets continue to improve.  Declining vacancy rates and higher rental rates are propelling new industrial, office, and retail development in much of the District.  Although most commercial projects are build-to-suit, a growing number of speculative projects are underway and more are anticipated this year.  Overall, the multifamily sector remains healthy.
