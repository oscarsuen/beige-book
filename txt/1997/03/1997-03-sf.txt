Reports from Beige Book contacts indicate a strong pace of economic growth in most Twelfth District states in the beginning of 1997, with Hawaii being the most notable exception.  Retailers reported moderate gains in recent months, and service providers in the District noted an acceleration in growth above an already rapid trend.  Manufacturing activity remained strong in much of the District, lifted by a booming aircraft industry and steady expansion in high-technology equipment manufacturing.  Recent increases in residential and commercial real estate demand have fueled construction activity in the District.  Respondents? generally positive views of the economy were tempered by many reports of tight labor markets and increasing wage pressures.  High turnover rates, reflecting frequent ?job-hopping,? were noted by several contacts in a variety of industries.
Commercial construction activity also was strong in most parts of the District.  In the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain states, respondents report that commercial office and warehouse space is hard to find and commercial and industrial construction is rising.  In Southern California, respondents report that the volume of commercial construction activity, while modest,  is higher than it has been in several years.
