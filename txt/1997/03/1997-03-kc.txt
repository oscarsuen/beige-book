The district economy continued to grow moderately last month.  Retail sales increased, manufacturing activity remained strong, and energy activity improved. Construction activity generally held steady.  In the farm economy, the winter wheat crop remained in good condition, and an improved outlook for the cattle industry slowed liquidation of district cattle herds.  Labor markets remained tight in much of the district, although there were fewer reports of wage increases than in previous months.  Prices were generally stable at the retail level and for materials used in manufacturing and construction.
Respondent banks held their prime lending rates steady last month and expect to leave rates unchanged in the near term.  Banks also held their consumer lending rates steady and plan no changes in the near future.   Lending standards were unchanged at most banks.
Bankers predict that district cattle and hog producers will enjoy a profitable year in 1997, thanks to lower feed costs.  The favorable outlook for the cattle industry may bring an early end to the liquidation phase of the cattle cycle.  Bankers report that district ranchers appear to have stopped reducing their cattle herds, and some are making plans to expand.
