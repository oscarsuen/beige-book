Despite record snowfalls and severe cold, the pace of the Ninth District economy apparently is quickening. Construction and oil drilling are equal to or ahead of year-earlier levels. Manufacturers generally report continued good business, if anything stronger than at the close of 1996.  Retail sales of general merchandise and vehicles reportedly picked up in January and February after a subdued holiday season. Tourism reportedly has improved somewhat in recent weeks. Labor markets remain very tight, with reports of substantial pay increases for some computer and engineering specialists.  But there are few reports of higher prices for goods or for inputs other than natural gas and lumber.
On the down side, the severe winter has been costly to agriculture. Output and employment at gold mines and oriented-strand board plants may be reduced due to declining product prices and large inventories.
On the negative side, some Montana gold mines are expected to slow output in 1997 due to low prices.  And a major producer of oriented-strand board announced it will lay off 500 workers at three plants for at least two weeks in March because of growing inventories and falling prices.  The phenomenon of sharply higher dimension-lumber prices coinciding with lower building board prices occurred because the latter product has not been subject to the same supply limitations as saw timber.
"Dealers have sold a ton of pickups," reports one South Dakota source.  Other industry spokespersons describe a pattern similar to general merchandise sales, that is general improvement in spite of episodic slow periods due to bad weather.
Despite tight labor markets, there are few reports of increasing prices at producer or consumer levels.  One exception is natural gas, cited by many industrial firms such as foundries and glass factories that use this resource for process heat.
