The District economy is holding steady at a good level, with many areas reporting joblessness near--or below--the national average.  Business activity remains especially strong in the central Ohio and southeastern Ohio/northern Kentucky regions, although virtually every major area reports favorable economic conditions.  Even in southwestern Pennsylvania, where business activity has been more moderate, joblessness has fallen to a six-year low.
According to District employment agencies, hiring of temporary workers slowed slightly in December, mostly likely due to seasonal cutbacks.  Still, employment growth remains above its rate at this time last year, and demand for general clerical, data processing, and technical positions continues to be strong.  Wage growth has picked up somewhat, especially for technically skilled workers such as engineers.  Employment agencies also report that benefit packages at smaller firms have increased as a result of tightened labor markets.
Manufacturing employment is steady or moderately higher, and wage increases are reported to be light despite generally tight labor markets.  Still, manufacturers say that finding qualified workers remains a challenge.
Retail inventory levels are reported to be "on plan," in part because of conservative stockpiling prior to this shopping season.  Several major retail chains have plans to open stores in the District this year, whereas very few report plans to close stores.
Dealers describe their inventories as marginally higher than desired, but they anticipate very little difficulty returning to preferred levels by the end of February.  Still, respondents characterize the new-car market as extremely competitive.  Several dealersnote a drop-off in demand for used cars, breaking a two-year upward sales trend in this market.
The growth rate of delinquencies has leveled off somewhat, with some bankers reporting a drop in past-due loans.  However, many bankers note a rise in household bankruptcies, which in some cases occur without experiencing credit delinquency.
Most respondents describe competition for borrowers as fierce.  The spread between lending and deposit rates has tightened as depositors continue to move savings into higher yielding money-market accounts.  Bankers report mixed credit quality trends: about half see no recent change, while the others see a slight deterioration.  Some lenders report a tightening in credit standards for credit cards.
