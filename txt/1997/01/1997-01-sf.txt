Reports from Beige Book contacts indicate continued strong expansion in most Twelfth District states toward the end of 1996.  Retailers reported a good holiday selling season, although adverse weather conditions in late December and early January held down post-Christmas retail activity.  Early January flooding in Northern California and Nevada also caused extensive damage to homes, farms, highways, and tourism facilities.  Some efforts to repair damage began immediately, boosting residential and non-residential construction, which have generally been strong in District states other than California and Hawaii.  Manufacturing activity continued to increase in recent months, putting some pressure on wages for skilled workers, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and the San Francisco Bay Area.
Service industries generally reported further growth in recent months.  Respondents from California and the Pacific Northwest reported increasing demand for telecommunications services, and efforts to keep up with this growing demand reportedly are putting upward pressure on wages of some types of skilled workers.  In Southern California, port traffic was strong, and tourism activity was brisk.  Tourism-related airport traffic and hotel occupancy rates also increased in several other states, including Utah, where pre-Olympic advertising increased downhill skiing business.  However, heavy rains and flooding constrained tourism in Nevada and Northern California, largely due to highway and park closures.
