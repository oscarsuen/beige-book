Reports from Third District business contacts in early January suggest that economic activity in the region has been moving up slowly.  Manufacturers said orders were increasing and they have stepped up shipments.  Most retailers indicated that they met their planned sales levels for the Christmas period--around 5 percent above 1995--but electronics and computer stores failed to match either their expectations or their year-ago results.  Auto dealers said sales dropped seasonally in December but they expect a rebound soon.  In general, both manufacturers and retailers indicated that inventories were around planned levels.  Bankers reported a seasonal increase in credit card lending but said other types of lending have been flat.
Businesses in several areas of the Third District noted continued hiring, especially in some service industries.  However, manufacturers have generally not been seeking to increase employment, although they continue to say they need skilled workers in some specialized occupations.  According to reports from some major employers in the District, there does not appear to be an acceleration in the rate of general wage increases.
Area manufacturing firms are expecting some improvement in the first half of the year despite the current slow start.  On balance, they predict rising orders and shipments over the winter and spring, but they are not planning to build up inventories in anticipation of the increased demand for their products.
Industrial prices have shown virtually no change; manufacturers said both input costs and output prices have been mainly flat in recent weeks.  Although a few manufacturers said they expect some price increases will be announced by their suppliers early in the year, they are not certain these higher prices will be effectively implemented.
Auto dealers in the region said sales dipped seasonally in December but they expect a rebound soon.  Inventories varied among dealers but appeared to be around planned levels overall.  In general, dealers expect sales in 1997 to be about even with the 1996 total, and they expect sales of light trucks and sport-utility vehicles to continue to be relatively stronger than sales of sedans.  Although some manufacturers' rebate programs have been extended into the new year and some reduced finance rates have been offered recently, dealers do not anticipate an extensive increase in these promotional strategies.
