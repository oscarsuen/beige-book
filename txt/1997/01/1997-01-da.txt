In December and early January, Eleventh District economic activity continued to expand at the slightly stronger pace established in late October and November. There were more reports of price pressures than in the last Beige Book, partly as a result of low inventory. Two industries reported that price pressures were less because new capacity had come on line. Most manufacturing activity was in a seasonal lull, with the exception of energy-related activity, which was strong. Retailers were happy but not overwhelmed with holiday sales. The financial services industry reported little change in lending, and construction and real estate activity continued at roughly the same level. High energy prices kept drilling and oil services activity strong. Agricultural producers reported generally good conditions but would like more rain.
