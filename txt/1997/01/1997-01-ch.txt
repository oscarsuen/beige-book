Overall economic activity in the Seventh District continued to increase moderately in December and early January amid signs of increasing wage pressures.  Holiday retail sales gains came in above last year's lackluster results but fell short of many retailer's earlier expectations.  Housing and construction activity picked up at the end of 1996, and manufacturing activity increased at a modest rate.  Bankers and other lenders reported that demand for both business and consumer loans remained strong but showed little or no signs of increasing.  The District's labor markets tightened further with many contacts reporting increasing wage pressures across the board.  Agricultural reports show hog production was still behind year-ago levels, but many observers were skeptical.
