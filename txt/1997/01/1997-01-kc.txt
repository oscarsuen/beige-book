The district economy continued to grow moderately the past month, while showing a few signs of slowing.  Manufacturing activity remained fairly strong.  Holiday retail sales were somewhat less than expected, and construction activity edged downward.  In the farm economy, the winter wheat crop remained in good condition and farm finances improved after an excellent fall harvest.  Labor markets remained tight in much of the district, leading some firms to increase wages.  Prices were generally stable at the retail level and for materials used in manufacturing and construction.
Respondent banks held their prime lending rates steady last month and expect to leave rates unchanged in the near term.  Banks also held their consumer lending rates steady and plan no changes in the near future.  Some banks tightened their lending standards on consumer loans, citing increased delinquencies.
Bankers report the higher farm income also led to some overall improvement in farm loan portfolios in the district.  The quality of loans made to crop producers improved substantially in 1996.  Performance of loans to livestock producers was mixed, with stronger performance by loans to cattle feeders offsetting weaker loans to ranchers.  District bankers expect farm income will be mixed in 1997.  Crop producers may see their income fall as yields and prices return to normal after an exceptional year in 1996.  Lower feed costs and higher calf prices should help boost profits in the livestock industry this year.
