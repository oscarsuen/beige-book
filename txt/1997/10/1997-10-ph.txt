Business activity in the Third District was mixed in September and early October.  Manufacturers reported continuing moderate gains in orders and shipments, although they did note some slight declines in employment.  Retailers have been adversely affected by abnormally warm weather that has delayed consumers' fall clothing purchases and, in the opinion of some merchants, other shopping as well.  Auto dealers also noted that sales have slowed in the past several weeks.  Bankers generally reported a dip in consumer lending, which they attribute partially to a slackening in consumption spending and partially to more restrictive credit standards.  Commercial and industrial lending has moved up slightly, and banks and other lenders continue to promote business loans aggressively.
More than three-fourths of the firms surveyed said both input and output prices have been steady.  The number of firms that have raised their prices recently was offset by an equal number that cut prices.  Although manufacturers who reported recent increases in input costs outnumbered those noting decreases, in general, firms in the District have been holding the line on the prices of their own products.  Plant managers say price resistance from the buyers of their products has prompted them to look for and implement more efficient production methods to offset increases in the costs of raw materials.
Auto dealers said that sales slipped in September from August and had not picked up yet in October.  While sales of sport utility vehicles have been good, a drop in sales of sedans has pulled down overall auto sales.  Similarly, overall inventories have risen above desired levels.  Dealers and manufacturers are offering larger rebates and other incentives in order to boost sales.
