Fifth District economic activity expanded moderately from an already high level in September and early October, amid increased reports of capacity constraints in some sectors.  Manufacturing output surged, while growth eased somewhat in the retail and services sectors.  Banks reported generally stronger loan demand, particularly for home mortgages.  Commercial real estate activity remained robust, but growth in the residential market showed signs of slowing.  Labor markets tightened further and moderate wage pressures persisted.  Prices, however, were little changed.  In agriculture, October rains helped to alleviate drought damage to hay and some field crops.
