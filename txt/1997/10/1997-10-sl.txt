The District economy continues to operate at a high level, and contacts remain optimistic about future economic prospects.  Tightness in labor markets, though, continues to be a concern.  Increased sales are prompting plant expansions and employment gains.  State sales tax collections through August suggest fairly strong consumer demand for goods and services.  Residential construction remains below last year's levels, and demand for apartments appears to be tapering off.  Loans outstanding at large District banks rose slightly in the two months ending in September.  Favorable harvest conditions prevail throughout most of the District; early reports on yields indicate they are meeting expectations.
On the heels of increased sales and plant expansions and development, employment is generally on the rise.  A telecommunications firm announced that it will convert an old manufacturing warehouse in the St. Louis region into a telemarketing center that will employ about 1,500 workers.  A trust company is opening a regional office in St. Louis to handle some of the new accounts it bought from NationsBank.  About 200 employees will be hired, many of whom previously worked for Boatmen's Trust.  A contact in the furniture industry reports that a Canadian firm is relocating to northeast Mississippi, bringing about 200 jobs.  A maker of office furniture will open a plant in northeast Arkansas, employing about 250 people.
Layoffs and closings have occurred in some sectors.  A shoe manufacturer, noting that two of its domestic plants were no longer economically feasible, is closing these plants and laying off about 300 workers.  A regional health management organization has opted to leave the pharmacy benefits management business, eliminating about 150 jobs in the St. Louis region; these services will be outsourced.  A contact at a picture frame manufacturer reports that the loss of a major client and a 50 percent drop in projected sales is forcing it to close.
Scattered instances of rail disruptions from the Union Pacific logjam have been reported in rural areas.  A large Arkansas rice cooperative, for example, reports that a shortage of rail cars has hampered new crop shipments.  It is not yet clear whether this problem is of a sufficient magnitude to cause harvest bottlenecks in other areas.
