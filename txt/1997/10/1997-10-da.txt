In September and early October, Eleventh District economic activity remained at roughly the same level reported in August. Many industries continued to report problems hiring, and some prices were higher. Manufacturing activity was mostly unchanged at a high level. Demand for business services continued to increase strongly, but retail sales growth was slower than expected. Bankers reported little change in lending. Construction activity continued to grow moderately, while energy activity remained extremely strong. Cotton farmers expect an excellent crop, and livestock conditions remained good.
Rail shipping delays caused headaches for some manufacturers, particularly in Houston and for chemicals, steel, lumber, cement and brick. Several firms shifted shipments to trucks and, for the most part, delays have not caused production problems. Stiff competition or long-term contracts are preventing many companies from passing higher shipping costs on to selling prices. Contacts expect the situation to improve by the first quarter of 1998.
Several industries reported higher selling prices. Selling prices and rental rates were up for many types of properties, particularly for office space, with year-over-year office rents increasing between 8 percent and double digits in some markets. Energy prices remained higher than expected. Oil prices spent most of August and September between $19.25 and $19.75 per barrel, but jumped to near $22 per barrel on October 3?the highest level since February?as President Clinton dispatched an aircraft carrier to enforce the no-fly zone over southern Iraq. Natural gas prices have been over $2.30 per Mcf since early August and strengthened by the end of September to over $3.00. Natural gas inventories have been 3 percent to 4 percent above last year but below normal, and contacts suggest that production is down, especially from the Gulf of Mexico. Petrochemical prices continue to weaken, however, due to large capacity additions both in the U.S. and Asia.
