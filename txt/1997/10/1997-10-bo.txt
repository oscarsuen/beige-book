The First District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, with contacts in manufacturing, retailing, and insurance reporting revenue growth.  Respondents say labor market tightness is confined to selected submarkets and is not translating into general wage acceleration; they cite wage and salary increases of 3 to 5 percent.  Prices of inputs and finished goods reportedly remain stable, with only a few exceptions.  A local forecasting group expects the region's rate of job growth to slow over the next couple of years, in line with the nation's.
Employment is said to be either increasing modestly or holding steady, with headcounts rising where sales are strongest.  Some respondents report pockets of tightness in labor markets, most notably in stores selling high-end apparel or office supplies and in low-skill areas related to tourism.  Other contacts holding employment steady cite no difficulty in hiring for turnover.  Even where labor markets are tight, wage inflation is not picking up; wage increases are in the 3 to 5 percent range.
Respondents report that prices are generally holding steady, although one seller of men's specialty apparel is reducing prices to move inventory.  Most contacts say that profit margins are unchanged or increasing slightly, with the increases attributed to efficiency improvements such as better inventory control, automation, and purchasing efficiencies.  With the exception of building materials, for which vendor prices are up about 3 percent, most contacts say that materials costs are also holding steady.  Looking forward, retailers expect steady growth at a  modest pace continuing through the first quarter of 1998.
Most respondents report that, overall, both materials costs and selling prices continue to be essentially flat.  Paper prices are firming somewhat, and paper product manufacturers have increased selling prices a little.  A few contacts report small price increases associated with product improvements or strong demand in certain niches.
Employment trends vary widely.  However, companies that have expanded or contracted noticeably over the past year now tend to report that their head counts are stabilizing.  Manufacturers generally cite average wage and salary increases in the range of 3 to 5 percent, with strong upward pressure in computer-related occupations.  On balance, contacts report that it is taking longer to fill openings in information systems, engineering, and accounting positions, especially in out-of-the-way locations.
Manufacturers mostly appear optimistic or at least hopeful that the coming year will see a continuation of current trends.  Respondents selling innovative products and those tapping into growth markets are especially upbeat.
Conditions vary across the region, with a vacancy rate of 5 percent in the downtown Boston office market, and 25 percent in the Greater New Haven office market.  After six months of little activity, Maine has reportedly picked up in the third quarter.  Rhode Island is also doing well, particularly the industrial and suburban office markets.  Conditions in Connecticut are mixed, although vacancy rates have declined slightly.  Respondents are optimistic about the rest of the year, with most predicting some new construction "soon."
