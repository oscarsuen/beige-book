The Seventh District economy continued its moderate rate of expansion in September and first half of October while prices remained in check.  Retail sales were hampered by unseasonably warm weather, but showed some improvement as temperatures cooled in mid-October.  On the other hand, warm weather was attributed for boosting new home sales and overall construction activity in the District.  Manufacturing production continued at very high levels and new orders remained strong.  Lending activity was again mixed by market segment, with the business side stronger than the consumer side.  Labor markets continued to tighten and there were a few new reports of intensifying wage pressures, most notably in rural areas.  Warm, dry weather permitted faster-than-normal progress with the fall harvest, yet grain prices rose contra-seasonally because of uncertainty over China's grain production and the effects of El Nino on tight world grain markets.
A surge in grain prices during the first half of October departed from the downtrend that normally extends through the harvest season.  The sharp rise reflects some pivotal issues that add to the speculative momentum in the relatively tight world grain markets.  The growing focus on El Nino and the uncertain weather implications that might result in food-growing areas of the world is one such issue.  Another reflects the uncertainty as to whether China will be a net importer or exporter of feed grains in the year ahead.
