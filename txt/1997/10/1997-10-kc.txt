The district economy continued to grow moderately the past month, while showing a few signs of easing.  Manufacturing activity remained fairly strong.  Retail sales edged down, construction activity eased somewhat, and energy activity declined slightly.  In the farm economy, record soybean production and average corn production are expected for the current harvest, and ranchers face favorable feeder cattle prices. Labor markets remained tight in much of the district, and reports of rising wages were more common than in previous months.  Prices generally held steady at the retail level while increasing slightly for some construction materials.
All respondent banks left their prime lending rates unchanged last month and expect to hold rates steady in the near term.  Most banks did not change their consumer lending rates and anticipate no future changes.  Lending standards were unchanged.
Winter wheat planting in the district is almost completed and recent rains have led to favorable growing conditions.  Likewise, pasture conditions are expected to be excellent this winter allowing some producers to hold cattle until spring.  Nevertheless, the majority of ranchers plan to sell their calves this fall or early next year.  With feeder cattle prices well above year-ago levels, ranchers should recoup some of the losses from the last two years.  However, large supplies continue to dampen fed cattle prices.  With higher corn prices and the increased cost of feeder cattle, many district feedlots will be unable to make a profit this fall.  Nevertheless, projected increases in beef exports could help strengthen fed cattle prices through the remainder of the year.
