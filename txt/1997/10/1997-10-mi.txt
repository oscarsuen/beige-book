The Ninth District economy remains strong.  Earnings are up, tax receipts exceed expectations, and consumers are willing to spend.  Plus, manufacturers report healthy sales, and a boomlet in oil and gas exploration is giving a lift to the North Dakota and Montana economies.  To accommodate expanding businesses, builders are scrambling to provide new facilities.  Mild fall weather has provided excellent harvest conditions.
The district's robust economy, however, is taxing the ingenuity of employers as they struggle to hire workers in the region's tight labor markets.  Although wage increases are not accelerating, employers are increasingly using other financial incentives to lure workers.  Firms are holding the line on the prices they pay for nonlabor inputs, but pressures appear to be building for price increases.
Meanwhile, tourism spending has recently improved.  "We're expecting a strong ending to a slow start," says an Upper Peninsula tourism official about business this fall.  Montana tourist-related businesses also experienced a pickup after a slow start.
Amid this expansion, restructuring continues.  In early October a large South Dakota computer manufacturer announced plans to lay off or reassign 300 workers as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts.  Meanwhile, a large Minneapolis/St. Paul manufacturer said it was eliminating 500 jobs in its home and building controls unit.
Tight labor markets are spawning creative recruiting efforts.  A temporary employment agency is using prized tickets for the Vikings/Green Bay Packers football game to lure new temporary workers.  A large Minneapolis/St. Paul retailer has its employees distributing "Wow?great service" cards to employees at other businesses who give them good service.  It is intended to "woo" them to the retailer, for on the card is a contact and telephone number for the retailer's human resources department.  Firms are also paying bonuses to employees for finding workers.
As the search for workers intensifies, "Employers raise the ante, but not wages," declares another recent newspaper headline.  A few firms are offering signing bonuses as high as $1,000 for new employees who stay with a job for six months; one retailer has expanded the merchandise discounts for its employees; and some employers have begun offering benefits packages to seasonal workers.  But a recent survey of Minnesota compensation specialists indicates that over the next 12 months the typical employee will see wages rise about 4 percent, which matches the increases they received during the previous 12 months.  Nevertheless, "we have been much more aggressive in paying for talent," states a human resource specialist at a large Minneapolis/St. Paul firm.
Besides striving to hold the line on wage increases, firms are resisting other cost increases.  Our company is "not accepting any price increases," reports a purchasing manager for a large Minneapolis/St. Paul company, and "the lid has been on price increases," states another purchasing manager.  Nevertheless, about 25 percent of respondents to a recent survey of Upper Midwest businesses report price increases on material inputs.
Moreover, "everyone coming at you wants a price increase," reports one of these purchasing managers, for most firms have not raised prices for the last two to three years.  Increasing pressure on firms to maintain profits could push prices up, a Minneapolis/St. Paul manufacturer believes.
