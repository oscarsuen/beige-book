District business conditions remain strong overall, with modest growth noted in production, orders, and employment for a variety of industries.  Price and wage increases continue to be slight, and unemployment is extremely low in many areas.
Temporary employment agencies are having difficulty meeting demand; a few of them report as much as a 20% increase over the previous month as employers step up seasonal hiring.  Information analysts and workers for light industry are in great demand.  The agencies also report increased recruiting costs.  However, with the notable exception of rising salaries for workers with computer skills, no general increase in wages is seen.
Organized labor reports little change from the current compensation growth trend of about 3% per year.  In some cases, union contract terms have been extended to four and five years, from their more traditional two- and three-year lengths.  Job security remains a focal point in labor negotiations as companies increase outsourcing, overtime, and the use of temporary workers.
Manufacturers report generally flat commodity prices, with the exception of a slight decline in copper.  Finished goods prices are also holding nearly steady.  Shortages of certain workers?especially of unskilled labor?were noted, although none of the manufacturers contacted indicated upward wage pressure.
Inventories are considered to be "in good shape," helped partly by improved inventory management systems.  Some District retailers see competitive pressures holding down price increases and do not note any large price increases from suppliers.
District auto sales were off between September and early October, perhaps because of generous end-of-summer incentives designed to clear out the remainder of the 1997 model year.  Most dealers expect sales to improve with the introduction of new models, for which a few specific shortages are already being seen.
Soybean production in the District is expected to be 19% higher than last year.  In fact, Kentucky's crop should be the largest in 15 years.  District-wide, 90% of the tobacco crop has been cut and the forecast for tobacco production is 11% higher than 1996 and its best showing in three years.  Despite some adverse weather and localized diseases, 84% of this season's crop is rated as good to fair, and 10% as excellent.
Corn prices received by farmers in September were mixed compared to the previous month (higher in Kentucky and Pennsylvania and lower in Ohio).  District farmers saw soybean prices fall between September and August.
Competition for borrowers is fierce, and the spread between borrowing and lending rates remains very narrow.  Many medium and small banks report added competitive pressures from credit unions.  The market for auto loans has been a particularly active area for credit unions.  Credit standards are described as holding steady, although consumer credit delinquencies are still on the rise.
