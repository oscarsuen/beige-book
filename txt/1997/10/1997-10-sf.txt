Reports from Beige Book contacts indicate a strong pace of growth in most Twelfth District states in the recent survey period.  District retailers reported moderate gains in recent months.  Whereas service providers, particularly those in the shipping and freight sector, noted an acceleration in growth above an already rapid trend.  Manufacturing activity remained strong in most of the District, as expansions in food-processing and wood product production added to booming growth in aircraft and high-technology equipment manufacturing.  Steady demand for residential and non-residential real estate kept construction activity at high level in much of the District.  The competition among financial institutions for "good" loans reportedly remained aggressive throughout the District.  Respondents' generally positive views of the economy were tempered by many reports of shipping bottlenecks and shortages of both skilled labor and entry-level workers.
Respondents in the service industry continued to report solid growth.  Demand for shipping and freight services in the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain States remained very high.  However, capacity constraints in this sector, particularly in rail transportation, could restrain further growth.  Travel and tourism remained strong in Utah and California, although fears of "El Nino" reportedly have caused cancellations for the winter tourist season.  Several respondents indicated that labor markets for service sector workers remain exceedingly tight at all skill levels.  Higher offer wages, signing bonuses, and referral awards were reported for positions ranging from technical sales staff to entry-level bank tellers.
Commercial real estate and construction activity remains strong in most parts of the District.  Respondents reported that commercial office and industrial space has become harder to find, despite an acceleration in commercial and industrial construction.  In Portland, the first signs of speculative building appeared, as construction began on two downtown office buildings.  In California, respondents report declines in commercial vacancy rates throughout the state.  Respondents in the hottest markets indicate that the demand for contractors, subcontractors, and materials finally has outpaced supply and is beginning to result in long waits and unbid contracts.
