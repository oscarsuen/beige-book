The Southeastern economy continued to post moderate growth into early fall, according to most contacts.  Merchants report that sales are up from a year ago, and they are optimistic about the holiday sales season.  Home sales and construction weakened slightly, while commercial real estate occupancy levels and building are increasing.   Factory activity is mixed, but contacts are positive about long-term prospects.  Commercial loan demand is stable, while consumer loan demand varies by location.   The tourism and hospitality industry continues to register strong numbers and a bright outlook.  Wage pressures are limited to a few industries, even though labor markets remain tight in several parts of the District.  The outlook for material and finished product prices over the next few months is for little change, according to most reports.
District commercial real estate markets remain healthy.  Most suburban and central district office markets continue to report rising occupancy levels and rental rates.  A good deal of speculative construction is underway.  The industrial market is near "equilibrium" throughout much of the District.  Despite declining occupancy rates and the presence of concessions in several District markets, multifamily construction remains at high levels.
Prices are generally stable.  Most contacts report that they are unable to pass increases at the input level on to end users because of competitive factors.  In Louisiana, costs in the oil and gas sector are rising notably.
