Economic growth in the Eighth District appears to have accelerated somewhat.  Retailers report a pickup in consumer spending during July and August, boosted by back-to-school sales that generally met or exceeded expectations.  Car dealers are optimistic that sales, bolstered by the 1998 models, will increase through the end of the year.  Most other District business contacts also report that their sales have met or exceeded expectations.  A further tightening of already tight District labor markets is expected in the fourth quarter, according to the latest Manpower survey.  District residential real estate markets are starting to experience an excess supply of available houses, especially higher-priced ones.  Loans outstanding continue to increase at large District banks.  Recent rains in mid- to late-August, while beneficial to the District's soybean crop, probably came too late to help the corn crop.
On average, July and August car sales were up about 3 percent over one year ago.  Many dealers have indicated that used car sales continue to be strong, but, for the most part, are not affecting new car sales.  Most dealers are optimistic about sales during the rest of the year, particularly now that many 1998 models are available.
A contact in the timber industry says that demand is on an upswing, and several new mills have opened in southern Arkansas to meet this higher demand.  A furniture industry contact reports that sales are somewhat stronger than last year, a record year for his company.  A telecommunications firm announced that it will open a new information technology center and a credit and collections center in the St. Louis region, bringing about 1,200 jobs by next year.  A contact in the steel industry reports that it will add new capacity in northeast Arkansas and create about 100 new jobs.
The District's apparel industry, however, is taking another large blow.  Fruit of the Loom announced it will lay off about 2,000 workers by October from two plants in southern Kentucky, bringing employment down to 5,000 from 11,000 just two years ago.  At the same time, Fruit of the Loom will increase employment by about 300 at a Mississippi plant by December because of expansion.  A contact in the paper industry reports that it is suffering from excess capacity worldwide, causing production slowdowns at local plants.
