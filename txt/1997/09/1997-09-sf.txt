Twelfth District contacts reported vigorous economic activity in the recent survey period.  Retail sales picked up in most areas, and service providers maintained high levels of activity.  Durable manufacturing output continued to expand rapidly.  Sales of most District agricultural and livestock products were high.  Commercial banks performed well, and lively conditions prevailed in real estate markets.  Respondents continued to report strong competition for highly skilled workers and some respondents noted a tightening market for entry-level workers. However, respondents reported very little upward pressure on the prices of final goods and services.
Conditions for District service providers were solid overall.  Thriving business conditions in most areas spurred rapid expansion by providers of media and communications services.  Demand for electricity and natural gas was held down somewhat by mild weather in the District; this combined with supply factors to cause stable or declining prices for both energy sources.  In contrast, respondents in California and Oregon noted rising prices for health care.  Tourist traffic increased noticeably in Southern California but slowed somewhat in Utah, Nevada, and Hawaii, in the latter due largely to a drop off in foreign visitors.  Some service providers reported tightness in the market for entry-level workers.
