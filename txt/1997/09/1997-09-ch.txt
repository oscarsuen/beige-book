In August and early September, the Seventh District economy expanded at a slightly higher rate than in our last report.  Consumer spending picked up as the weather cooled across the region and back-to-school sales met or exceeded merchants' expectations.  Commercial building activity continued to lead the housing/construction sector, while sales of existing homes improved.  Manufacturers continued to produce at very high levels and order books generally remained full.  Bankers reported increased lending activity in most areas with the business side continuing to outpace the consumer side. While labor markets remained very tight, there was little, if any, change in wage pressures.  Crop conditions improved due to recent rains, and farmland values continued to trend upward.
