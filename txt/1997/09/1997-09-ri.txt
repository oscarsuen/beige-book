The overall pace of Fifth District economic activity picked up in August, although growth in some sectors moderated since our last report.  Manufacturing expanded more rapidly than in the June-July period, but retail and services growth slowed somewhat.  Banks reported that lending activity rose modestly and that demand remained strong for commercial loans and residential mortgages.  In real estate, commercial leasing activity increased further while residential activity remained mixed.  Labor markets continued to be tight and wage pressures were more noticeable, especially for skilled workers.  Price pressures were little changed.  In agriculture, crop yield prospects diminished because of continued dry weather.
