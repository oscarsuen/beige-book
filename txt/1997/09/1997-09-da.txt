Eleventh District economic activity expanded in August, leading many contacts to express optimism about the outlook for the remainder of the year. Labor shortages continued to be reported, boosting wages in a few industries. Office rents and some energy and other product prices were higher. Demand grew at the same pace or increased for most manufacturers. Retail sales picked up, and demand continued to increase for services. Construction activity grew at a moderate pace, boosted by strong growth in commercial construction. Bankers said demand for financial services was unchanged. The energy industry continued to report strong demand and profits. Crop and livestock conditions were generally good.
Strong demand and tight supplies placed upward pressure on energy prices in August. Any disruption in normal delivery conditions, due to mechanical problems or weather, was immediately reflected in higher energy prices. Natural gas prices were pushed up by strong demand for current consumption and for storage to meet winter demand. Strong demand and tight supplies kept oil prices near $20 per barrel. Gasoline prices remained high--driven partly by a series of mechanical problems at large refineries and by a shortage of additives to produce clean-burning summer gasolines--but are expected to begin a seasonal decline soon. Ethylene capacity continued to be tight, but upward pressure on the selling price of ethylene and some other petrochemical products was restrained because large amounts of new capacity had come on line or is scheduled to come on line in the fourth quarter.
