Reports from businesses in the Third District indicated that economic activity in the region increased moderately in August.  Manufacturers reported some gains in shipments and orders.  Retail sales increased modestly for the month and on a year-over-year basis, although auto sales were just about the same as a year ago.  Lending activity at area banks was up slightly.  Commercial real estate markets continued to firm up a bit, and construction activity has increased, but not by a significant amount.  Homes sales have been steady in most parts of the District, and home prices were reported to be appreciating only marginally.
Most firms contacted for this report continued to describe industrial prices as steady.  Three out of four said both input and output prices have not changed from last month.   More companies noted recent increases than decreases in costs for the goods they purchase, but the number of area firms that raised prices for their own products was offset by the number reducing prices.
Auto dealers said sales ran at a steady pace throughout August and at about the same rate as in August of last year.  Manufacturers incentives have not boosted overall sales, but they have enabled dealers to reduce inventories of current models as they begin to receive shipments of new cars.
Reports from residential real estate agents indicated that home sales in the District have been running at a steady rate recently.  Realtors said the pace has been good, although lower than in the spring.  According to real estate agents and builders, both existing and new home prices do not appear to be appreciating very much.  A continuing large supply of homes for sale is limiting  price increases, although the amount of time homes are on the market before being sold has been declining.
