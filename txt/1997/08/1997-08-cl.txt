Business activity in the District is expanding amid extremely low levels of joblessness and modest wage and price increases.  A growing number of counties scattered around Ohio and northern Kentucky report unemployment rates under 3 percent.  In eastern Pennsylvania, where unemployment is somewhat higher than elsewhere in the District, labor markets are strengthening.  	Demand for temporary workers continues to rise, but at a more moderate pace than earlier in the year.  Temporary employment agencies are having difficulty attracting and retaining a variety of workers, including experienced secretaries and personnel with computer skills.  Many firms are addressing the shortfall of skilled workers through internal training programs.  No respondents reported accelerated wage growth.
Construction activity is vigorous, with housing, commercial, and road and highway building all improved from the spring.  A shortage of bricklayers is noted.
No significant price increases or materials shortages were observed, but several firms indicated difficulty hiring engineers, and employment agencies reported trouble finding workers for light industrial jobs and filling skilled positions such as welders.
Auto dealers report that sales have slowed from the exceptional pace of the previous two years, and imports have recently begun to outperform domestic brands.  Dealers, who indicate that competition has reduced prices and increased promotional costs on a wide variety of models, see profit margins narrowing.
New car inventories are said to be "cautiously lean," with the usual shortages of a few popular models.  Used car sales remain weak, however, and a few dealers indicated deep price discounts on used vehicles.
Spring flooding affected strawberry farmers in southern Ohio and northern Kentucky, and an estimated one-third of the crop has been lost.  Cold weather this spring has adversely affected the District's tree fruit industry.
Bankers indicate that the spread between borrowing and lending rates remains narrow, and a few are considering alternatives to traditional lending, such as investment banking and insurance, to help bolster profits.
