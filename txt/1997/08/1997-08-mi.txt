Midsummer finds the Ninth District economy experiencing continued moderate growth.  Construction seems indefatigable.  Despite some slowing in residential construction, employment and overall activity for the sector continue to grow apace. Sales of autos and consumer goods are solid. Manufacturers describe strong output and do not report problems with inventories or with securing inputs. Oil and gas activity is very strong.  Forest products firms in the eastern part of the district report steady output, but there has been noticeable slowing in Montana.  Farmers have been on a weather roller coaster, and prospects are for a good to average crop.  Beef  and hog producers continue to enjoy higher prices than a year ago, with output largely steady. Unemployment rates are low in most areas, and employment numbers high.  Product prices show little, if any, increase.
Two areas show some problems.  Output is slowing somewhat at a few iron mines in the face of  higher output inventories and ongoing structural change in the steel industry.  The summer season is disappointing to tourist businesses in many areas, with visitation rates somewhat below last year's levels.
Residential permit numbers in Minnesota have slowed somewhat compared to one-year and two-year-ago levels, particularly in apartment buildings.  Nevertheless, construction employment for that state is 4 percent above 1996 and 12 percent above 1995, indicating that the sector as a whole remains strong.  Both commercial and residential building also continue to be strong in western Wisconsin and in southeastern South Dakota.
Markets for existing real estate are also brisk.  "It's really a sellers' market," says one St. Paul, Minnesota, suburban residential realtor.  Commercial property rental markets also are active.
"We are very busy," comments the manager of a Grand Forks, N.D., discount store.  "People are buying lots of things to replace items damaged by the flood."  Even without that special circumstance, retail sales in other areas also appear vigorous.  Sales tax receipts on general merchandise reportedly are running ahead of projections in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Dakotas.  Retail chains generally report good revenues and earnings.
But tourism is the soft side of household spending.  Visits at national parks and monuments in western regions of the district are trailing 1996 by as much as 20 percent.  Canoe outfitters in northern Minnesota describe bookings as somewhat slack, and recurring rain storms have slowed other summer recreation activities in Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula.  Fishing resorts describe moderate, steady business.  One bright spot: Large areas of open water in the prairie pothole regions of eastern North Dakota and South Dakota bode well for fall waterfowl hunting.
But product prices for intermediate and final goods remain quiescent.  Gasoline prices have dropped a cent or two from late spring and are a few cents below summer 1996 levels.
