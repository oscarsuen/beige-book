The Seventh District economy continued its moderate expansion in June and July with no new reports of upward price pressures. Consumer spending picked up from our last report as weather conditions improved, with sales slightly exceeding most retailers' expectations.  Commercial construction activity continued to increase and the residential market, while softer than last year, remained strong.  Manufacturing activity picked up from a brief slowdown in the second quarter, due in part to settled auto-related strikes.  Lending activity was very strong in June and July and asset quality was reportedly improving.  Labor markets continued to tighten and a few new reports of upward wage pressures emerged, particularly in lower-paying and clerical occupations.  Recent rains helped restore favorable conditions for most of the District's developing crops.
