The Second District's economy expanded at a somewhat faster rate than in the last report, led by a rebound in consumer spending.  Retail sales, which had been held down by unseasonably cool weather for most of the second quarter, picked up in late June and were ahead of plan in July.  Office markets throughout the New York metropolitan area continued to tighten in the second quarter, though rents in most areas have risen only modestly.  Housing markets continued a trend of gradual improvement in New Jersey and downstate New York but remained depressed in upstate New York.  Regional purchasing managers' reports indicate moderate growth in manufacturing activity in June.  Price pressures in the District remained subdued.  Finally, local banks report some softening in demand for consumer and non-residential mortgage loans, along with a further decline in delinquency rates.
Virtually all of the retailers surveyed report that inventories are in "great shape" thanks to the recent pickup in sales of summer-related merchandise.  All contacts reported that merchandise costs are essentially flat, and that selling prices are flat to declining.  Retail wage pressures remain subdued, although one contact reports that labor costs have begun rising?mostly for new hires.
Sales and prices of existing single-family homes are up moderately from a year ago in downstate New York and New Jersey, but are down across most of upstate New York.  Similarly, permits to build single-family homes have been trending up in the New York City area and are near an 8-year high; however, in upstate New York, permits are down more than 15 percent from a year ago and at their lowest level since the 1981-82 recession.  Builders in northern New Jersey report that sales of new homes were "okay but not great" in June and early July.  While selling prices are flat, a major concern among builders is high and escalating land costs, reflecting a dearth of usable land.
Commercial real estate markets across the New York City metropolitan area continued to tighten in the second quarter.  Midtown Manhattan's office availability was 11.3 percent at the end of June, down from 11.5 percent a month earlier; Downtown's rate declined to 21.0 percent from 21.2 percent.  Both rates fell by a full point during the second quarter.  Similarly, vacancy rates continued to trend down in northern New Jersey, Long Island, Fairfield, and Westchester Counties in the second quarter.  However, average rents were up only modestly in most areas, except in northern New Jersey, where they have accelerated steadily over the past four quarters and are up 7.5 percent from a year ago.
New York City implemented two new transit-fare changes on July 4th that reduced commuting costs for some residents: free electronic transfers between bus and subway (ending "two-fare zones"), and elimination of the 50-cent Staten Island Ferry fare.
Interest rates decreased for all categories of loans, with 36 percent of banks surveyed reporting lower rates.  This decrease was especially evident in residential mortgages, with 50 percent of banks lowering rates.  Average deposit rates increased, with over 36 percent of banks reporting higher rates.  	Delinquency rates continued to decline for all types of loans except residential mortgages, for which delinquencies remained stable.
