Economic activity in the Fifth District grew at a faster rate in June and July, led by stronger revenue growth in services and retail trade.  Manufacturing continued to expand at a healthy pace in most industries.  Commercial real estate leasing and construction increased somewhat more quickly in recent weeks while residential activity was mixed.  Banks reported greater interest in residential mortgages and stronger demand for commercial loans.  Although labor markets continued to be tight, wage pressures remained largely in check, except in the retail sector.  In agriculture, recent heavy rains brought relief to some crops that had been stressed by unusually dry weather in June and July; however, there was flooding in some areas.
