The District economy continued to grow moderately last month, though with a few signs of slowing.  Manufacturing activity remained strong and energy activity improved further.  Retail sales edged down, however, and construction activity eased somewhat.  In the farm economy, the winter wheat harvest was much better than last year, spring crops were in good condition, and the cattle industry benefited from high prices and excellent pasture.  Labor markets remained tight in much of the District, and some companies responded by increasing wages for entry-level workers and certain skilled positions.  Prices generally held steady at the retail level while increasing slightly for some manufacturing materials.
All respondent banks left their prime lending rates unchanged last month and expect to hold rates steady in the near term.  Most banks did not change their consumer lending rates and anticipate no future changes.  A few banks tightened their lending standards, citing concerns over credit quality.
District cattle feedlots are profitable, although a recent downturn in fed cattle prices has squeezed profits. The number of cattle in feedlots is higher than a year ago, suggesting that supplies of beef to consumers are likely to remain high and fed cattle prices could drift lower in coming weeks.  Feedlots continue to market cattle as quickly as possible to stay ahead of falling prices.  Meanwhile, excellent pasture conditions and high feeder cattle prices are yielding profits for most District ranchers, and ranchers are optimistic that the profits will continue this fall.
District hog producers are also enjoying a profitable year, and a new tide of pork exports to Japan may keep hog prices at profitable levels.  Higher futures prices have encouraged existing hog operations to expand and large corporate farms to move into the District.  While the increased production is boosting rural economic activity, many rural residents are concerned about the impacts on quality of life.
