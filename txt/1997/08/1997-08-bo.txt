The First District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Most retail and manufacturing contacts report rising revenues and little change in prices.  Employment is steady or up slightly, and wages are generally said to be rising at a 2 to 6 percent annual pace; the exceptions are specific occupations in short supply, mostly technical and highly skilled jobs, which command greater wage increases plus other rewards.  Commercial real estate continues to improve in New England, with the Boston market very strong.  Insurance companies' revenues are rising, but they are cutting employment.
Employment is reported to be either steady or increasing in line with sales.  Contacts mention pockets of labor market tightness, including  jobs in construction, tourism, and highly skilled occupations. Low-skill workers still appear to be abundant.  Wages are reported to be growing at a 4 to 6 percent pace.
All respondents report that competitive pressures are keeping both their suppliers' and their own prices steady.  Profit margins are also holding steady.  Across the board, contacts say that efficiency improvements (better inventory control, automation, and purchasing efficiencies) are required to maintain profitability.  Most respondents have moderated their capital expansion plans, but tourism and office supply firms are expanding rapidly.
Looking forward, retailers expect steady growth with  low inflation continuing through 1997.  While contacts evince nervousness that the good times can't last forever, they express cautious optimism about 1998.
Most manufacturers indicate little if any pressure from materials costs, although furniture-grade lumber and copper costs are said to be rising.  Selling prices are also largely stable.  Contacts across a wide spectrum of industries mention that large firms are using their market power to contain costs.
A majority of respondents report that their overall employment is unchanged or up a little from a year ago.  Several mention difficulties filling openings in information and health technologies, engineering, and skilled blue-collar occupations; in most cases, improved compensation packages or up-front bonuses are necessary to attract candidates.  More generally, however, manufacturers tend to describe labor availability as adequate and appear satisfied with paying wage and salary increases in the range of 2 to 4 percent.  In addition, one-quarter indicate they are expanding their use of variable, performance-based compensation.
About one-half of the manufacturing contacts report making heavy capital investments this year.  These projects include additions to capacity (in some cases, to introduce new products) and expenditures on management information systems.  Most other respondents say that capital spending levels remain normal.
Several manufacturers express satisfaction with prospects for continued macroeconomic growth and low inflation, although others mention the challenges of operating in a highly competitive environment or the risks of further appreciation of the dollar.  Several contacts are focused on particular industry trends such as improving demand in computer-related markets or prospective declines in automotive-related business.
