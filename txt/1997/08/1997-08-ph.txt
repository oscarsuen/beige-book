Economic conditions in the Third District improved moderately in June, and the pickup was continuing into July, according to business contacts around the region.  Manufacturers generally reported gains in shipments and orders in July.  Retailers noted some growth in sales during June and the first weeks of July, although auto dealers said overall sales of new vehicles were off.  Slackening demand for cars offset increased sales of light trucks.  Bankers said consumer lending continued to advance and there have been some small increases in commercial lending recently.  Tourism officials throughout the District said the summer season was off to a good start, with generally strong attendance at beach and mountain resorts and high hotel occupancy rates in major cities.
For the region's manufacturing industries as a whole, order backlogs were edging up, but delivery times were unchanged.  Inventories have been reduced slightly.  There has also been a small increase in employment.  Several manufacturers reported that they have been keeping the prices of their products steady in response to continuing strong foreign competition, and makers of consumer goods said retailers have been pressing them to keep prices from rising as they face heavy store-versus-store rivalry.
Most automobile dealers reported that total sales for June and early July continued on a slight downward trend.  Dealers estimate the decline at around 2 percent from a year ago.  The light truck market continued to expand at a rate of about 5 percent, year-over-year, but this increase was not enough to offset the declining car market.  On average, dealers reported that inventories were generally high, which they said encouraged manufacturers to offer relatively large sales incentives.  In contrast to the weakness in new car demand, dealers said sales of used cars remained strong and service activity was high.
Looking ahead, bankers do not foresee an acceleration of loan growth.  Despite the small recent increase in business lending, most of the bankers contacted for this report said the demand for commercial loans is not strong.  Consumer lending is expected to continue growing, but only a modest increase is anticipated.  Facing declining net interest margins and slow growth in lending, banks in the Third District are increasingly looking to introduce and expand fee-earning financial services for both businesses and individuals.
