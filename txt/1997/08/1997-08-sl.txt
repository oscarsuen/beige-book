The District economy is still growing at a moderate pace.  District firms continue to report growth in sales and employment, though tight labor markets persist in many parts of the District.  Contacts are generally optimistic about near-term economic conditions.  Residential construction still lags last year's levels even though half of the District's metropolitan areas saw increases in their monthly permit levels in May.  Total loans outstanding at large District banks rose slightly during the past two months, with commercial and industrial lending posting the largest increase.  In sharp contrast to our previous report, when below-average temperatures and above-average rainfall were the norm, hot and dry weather has prevailed in most areas, causing crop and pasture conditions to deteriorate somewhat.
The District's furniture industry got a boost when a manufacturer decided to consolidate two of its plants into an Arkansas plant, bringing about 900 new jobs.  Two new distribution warehouses will be built in the District, one that will employ almost 400 in Illinois and another that will employ about 450 in Mississippi.  Truck engine and parts sales have recently exceeded expectations, according to a contact who expects this trend to continue in the coming months.  Most contacts remain optimistic about economic conditions in the foreseeable future.
The District's apparel industry, however, is still experiencing plant closures because of overseas competition.  For example, a shirt manufacturer closed at the end of last month, eliminating 135 jobs.  In addition, the District's paper industry will shrink some as a major producer shutters two plants in a companywide restructuring.  About 300 jobs will be lost at the two plants.
The harvesting of the District's wheat crop is largely complete.  Early reports from Illinois suggest yields were above average in many areas and exceeded many farmers' expectations.  Yields are expected to be above average in Indiana and Missouri also, but close to average or slightly below average elsewhere.
