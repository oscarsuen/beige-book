Reports from most contacts suggest that growth remains moderate across much of the District.  Manufacturing in the region has been mixed, and retailers continue to see only a modest rise in sales over last year.  Realtors indicate that recent sales are near last year's strong levels, while builders say that new home construction has dipped below last year's levels in many parts of the District.  However, tourism and business travel remain strong, especially to destinations in Florida.  Wage pressure remains subdued in most areas of the region, with the exception of south Louisiana, which is experiencing a boom created by the reemergence of the oil and gas industry.
District commercial real estate markets remain strong.  Office markets continue to improve as vacancy rates drop, and construction remains at a brisk pace.  Speculative office construction is underway in many District markets.  The industrial market also remains strong across most of the region.  However, lack of suitable land is slowing development in several areas.  The weakest segment of the commercial real estate market continues to be multifamily housing, with several markets showing some overbuilding, declining occupancy rates, and increasing incentives to attract new renters.
