The First District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Sales and revenue gains are reported to be healthy, but manufacturers and retailers express concern about whether the current pace of activity is sustainable.  Prices are said to be generally flat, although wage pressures are increasing in some submarkets.  Contacts say the residential real estate market is performing well.
Employment is reported to be either increasing moderately or holding steady.  Contacts mention pockets of tightness in labor markets, most notably the faster-growing sectors.  In these submarkets, significant wage premiums are being offered to attract labor from competitors.  In contrast, contacts that are mainly hiring for normal turnover report little difficulty in attracting help.  Wages are generally said to be increasing at a 3 to 5 percent annual rate.
Respondents indicate that most prices are holding steady because of an extremely competitive retail environment.  The exception is tourism, where rates are rising to ration the short supply of hotel rooms.  Materials costs are said to be unchanged.  Contacts say that profit margins are either level or increasing slightly because of efficiency improvements that outweigh wage increases.  The two exceptions are office/graphics supplies and tourism;  hotels are realizing increases in profits as prices rise, while office supply stores report wage-driven declines in profitability.
Most contacts plan modest capital expansions for 1998.  Looking forward, retailers expect moderate growth continuing through the first quarter of 1998.  However, a significant minority of retailers mention the possibility of the stock market and international events negatively affecting growth prospects for next year.
Manufacturers indicate that most materials costs are flat to down.  However, high-grade lumber prices are considerably higher than a year ago and expected to increase further as a result of strong demand.  Contacts are also paying higher prices for packaging, upholstery materials, and natural gas.  Only one contact (a manufacturer of upscale furnishings) has implemented a meaningful increase in selling prices.  The remainder report that selling prices are flat to down as a result of competition, resistance on the part of retail chains, or productivity gains.  A sizeable minority express concern that competition will exert further downward pressure on prices.
With some exceptions, employment at respondent firms is holding steady.  Manufacturers are experiencing very tight labor markets for information technology and engineering positions, as well as some shortages of production workers in rural areas.  Average pay is said to be rising at a rate of 3 to 6 percent, with greater increases for some technically-oriented and senior professional categories.
On the whole, projections for 1998 are somewhat guarded.  Some manufacturers foresee revenue growth in the low single digits.  Others expect better results but most hasten to add that rates of growth are unlikely to match this year's performance.
