On average, car dealers report that sales were up about 1 percent in September and October over a year earlier.  Most dealers are offering rebates to help compensate for the sluggish sales.  Contacts also note that, while demand for sport utility vehicles is strong and rising, the market for minivans seems to have dried up.  Overall, contacts are expecting sluggish sales to persist through the end of 1997, and are approaching the first quarter of 1998 with guarded optimism.
Sales remain strong, and many manufacturers expect to hire additional workers to meet the increasing demand.  Ford, for example, is expanding its truck production in Louisville, creating about 1,000 new jobs.  Processing centers for mortgages and insurance claims are opening or expanding, bringing 200 jobs to St. Louis and almost 400 jobs to Louisville.  The gaming region of northwest Mississippi will employ 15,000 by the end of this year, and expectations are that it will add another 1,800 workers next year, although it is unclear where the workers will come from.
The District's apparel industry sustained several new blows.  After letting 2,000 workers go from two Kentucky plants this past August, Fruit of the Loom has announced that another 1,000 will be let go from the same two plants; production is moving overseas.  And because the demand for jeans has dropped so much, Levi Strauss will close two plants in Arkansas, eliminating 675 jobs.
Rail disruptions in the Eighth District, stemming from the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger, continue to be confined primarily to Arkansas, where the bulk of UP's rail lines in the  District are located.  Accordingly, a contact in the grain supply and delivery industry in St. Louis notes minimal disruptions in Illinois, Indiana and Missouri.
