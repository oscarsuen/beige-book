District retailers indicate difficulty finding seasonal workers, although no more so than in recent years.  One notable exception appears to be in central Ohio, where reports of more extreme labor shortfalls are heard.  Temporary employment agencies note a further rise in the already heavy demand for workers, especially clerical help and general laborers.  Only a few sources report increased wage growth, although a number of firms are offering increased benefits and more flexible work rules.
Firms with significant sales in Asia have seen a falloff in orders recently.  In particular, orders for semiconductor manufacturing equipment declined substantially between August and October.
Retailers surveyed indicate that year-over-year sales are currently running about 3% to 5% above last year's level, with a few reporting substantially higher growth rates.  Inventory levels are thought to be adequate for the season, although a strong holiday sales period is generally anticipated.  Retailers continue to report steady prices.  In some cases, wholesale costs actually seem to be falling.
Auto sales in early November continued a string of generally soft reports that began in September, and many dealers expressed concern over their growing inventories.  Price incentives are reported to be on the rise.  Sales activity in the used car market is seen as especially slow, and deep price discounts are being offered.
Kentucky tobacco production is expected to be 8% higher that last year, down slightly from preliminary projections.  The quality and condition of the crop are variable, and there is some concern about poor color and weight.
Major auctions during the first two weeks of November suggest a strong demand in the District's horse farm industry.  At one auction, more than 2,000 horses were sold over the period and gross sales topped $200 million, a record high.  Dealers and breeders report that the improved numbers are due to high stock quality and a healthy domestic economy.  Selling prices, while strong, were not judged to be unusually high.
The spread between borrowing and lending rates remains narrow, and competitive pressures are still reported to be fierce.  A few banks note that competitive pressures have prompted an easing of commercial credit standards.
