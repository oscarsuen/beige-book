Service industry respondents continued to report strong growth.  Respondents from Northern California and the Pacific Northwest reported healthy demand for telecommunication and business services.  Demand for shipping and freight services continued to increase in many District states.  In Southern California port traffic growth reportedly accelerated over an already rapid trend.  Throughout the District, service industry respondents reported a dearth of employees at the desired skill levels.  Contacts also noted that high turnover rates and short employee tenure were becoming  primary concerns.  However, many respondents remained reluctant to raise overall wage levels and instead have begun to take other actions, such as converting part-time to full-time jobs and giving periodic merit awards.
