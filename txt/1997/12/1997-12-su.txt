By industry, heavy equipment manufacturers and steel producers in Chicago and Dallas report strengthening demand.  In contrast, demand for apparel, textiles and electronic equipment appears to be weakening in a number of Districts.

Wage pressures have increased somewhat but are generally isolated to a few industries and occupations with severe labor shortages.  Boston, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco report increasing labor demand in the financial services sector, with some reports of increased wage pressures.  Retailers in almost all Districts are having particular trouble hiring and retaining workers for the busy holiday season.  While some retailers in Boston and Minneapolis have hiked wages, certain stores in the New York and San Francisco Districts have resorted to offering nonwage incentives, such as bonuses and steeper in-store discounts. More generally, businesses are dealing with labor shortages in a variety of ways.  Some are tapping broader geographic labor markets: Atlanta reports that shipyards are recruiting from overseas; Chicago cites businesses recruiting in nearby rural areas or relocating to the inner-city.  Cleveland reports that firms are offering increased benefits and more flexible work rules, while retailers and banks in the San Francisco District are converting part-time to full-time jobs.

Rail disruptions were reported to be minimal in the St. Louis District, but some problems related to the handling and storage of perishable crops were cited by San Francisco.  Minneapolis reports that grain producers in North Dakota have been hurt by severe plant disease problems.
