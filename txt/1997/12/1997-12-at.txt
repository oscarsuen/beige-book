District commercial real estate markets remain healthy.  Most suburban and central District office markets continue to report rising occupancy and rental rates.  A good deal of speculative construction is underway.  Retail construction continues to be dominated by grocery store chain expansions and the move by retailers into secondary marketplaces.  Multifamily construction has begun to decline in many parts of the District in response to higher vacancy rates and the presence of leasing concessions in several key markets.
