Most businesses reported that competitive pressures were limiting the pass through of cost increases to customers.  However, energy prices remained a concern for several industries.  Contacts noted that suppliers of petroleum-based products are continuing to increase prices and most reports indicated no rollbacks in energy surcharges.  Some large vendors have said that they plan to keep surcharges, but adjust them based on energy prices.  The plant manager of a major chemical facility reiterated that increases in natural gas prices, a major input in their operations, have resulted in higher prices for petrochemicals.  Some commercial builders reported that materials prices are increasing faster than they can be passed along, and are concerned that some projects could be delayed or cancelled as a result.
Oil and natural gas production continued to recover in the Gulf of Mexico.  Oil production has returned to over 70 percent of pre-storm levels and natural gas production is back to over 80 percent of normal production.  Contacts report significant increases in exploration planned for 2006.
