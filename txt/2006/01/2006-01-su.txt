Economic expansion continued across the twelve Federal Reserve Districts through the last several weeks of 2005.                Six—New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City—characterized their economies as expanding moderately or modestly.  Activity accelerated or increased at a solid pace in the San Francisco, Richmond, Atlanta, and Dallas Districts.  Boston characterized activity as continuing to expand, while Cleveland reported that conditions remained reasonably strong.
Most Districts reported moderate increases in employment.  Labor markets tightened in some areas and for some occupations, but on the whole, wage increases were characterized as moderate.  Contacts reported that input-price pressures have continued for many items, particularly early in the supply chain, but they were less intense at year-end than earlier.  Retail prices and producers' prices for more finished goods, however, were widely reported as rising only moderately or remaining stable.
Retail sales rose in most Districts, and those Districts that reported on travel and tourism spending said it was generally strong.  Increases in manufacturing activity were widely reported.  Most Districts indicated some cooling in residential real estate activity, while many noted that commercial real estate activity generally continued to improve.  Consumer borrowing was flat or fell in most Districts, while commercial borrowing was more mixed, with many Districts reporting moderate increases in activity.  Conditions in the energy sector seemed strong, while agricultural activity was mixed.
Retail prices were generally regarded as stable, though there was some significant discounting reported in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts during the holiday selling season. More moderate discounting was reported in the Dallas District, levels about the same as last year were reported in the San Francisco District, and no widespread discounting was reported in the Philadelphia District.  Price increases are planned in the months ahead by a large share of retailers, according to the Kansas City District.
Atlanta reported several locations with tight labor market conditions, while Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported specific occupations in which jobs have been difficult to fill.  Several of these Districts cited trucking jobs. Skilled construction workers are relatively sought after in Dallas and San Francisco, and skilled manufacturing jobs were mentioned by Boston, Chicago, and Dallas. Atlanta listed a variety of specialties in "extreme shortage." New York and San Francisco noted that finance-industry labor markets were relatively tight.  Despite reports of labor market tightness, Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco all noted that wage increases have been generally moderate.  However, New York, Chicago, and Dallas all reported some acceleration in compensation.
Automobile sales were generally somewhat sluggish across the nation.  Dealers fared best in the Richmond, San Francisco, and Dallas Districts, where sales improved from low levels.  Sales trends were somewhat more mixed in the Chicago and Atlanta Districts.  Atlanta and Philadelphia reported that sales remained strong for foreign brands, even as demand waned for domestic ones, sales of which were reportedly not helped much by manufacturers' promotions.  Philadelphia and Kansas City characterized truck and SUV sales as especially slow.
Production of high-technology goods was steady to slightly increasing toward the end of 2005, according to the San Francisco and Dallas Districts.  And defense and aerospace industry production improved in the San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta Districts.  Manufacturers of machine tools and industrial equipment also reported more robust demand in the San Francisco, Chicago, and Philadelphia Districts.  Production of construction-related materials and equipment expanded noticeably in the San Francisco, Dallas, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts but was characterized as slightly less strong in the Boston District.  Primary metals producers reported strong demand in the Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts.  Producers of plastics and petrochemicals noted some slowing in demand in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts, though this was from fairly high levels.  By contrast, reports from the Richmond and St. Louis Districts suggested some improvement in the sector.  And weakness in the textile industry was reported in the Boston, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts.
In the transportation equipment sector, reports from the Boston, Philadelphia, and Atlanta Districts suggested weakness among automakers and their suppliers.  However, in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts, activity appeared to be somewhat stronger.  Heavy truck production was also characterized as improving in the Chicago District.  Conditions in the transportation equipment sector were more mixed in the St. Louis District.
Conditions in Districts' commercial real estate markets generally continued to improve.  Vacancy rates fell in the San Francisco, Minneapolis, New York, Dallas, Richmond, and Kansas City Districts.  Chicago reported a more mixed picture, with some areas of the District expanding but activity in the city of Chicago flat.  Largely because of lower vacancy rates, rents rose in San Francisco and New York, while previous concessions were reduced or eliminated in Dallas.  New construction activity was reported to be increasing in the San Francisco, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Atlanta, and Cleveland Districts, and many contacts expect this trend to continue in 2006.
