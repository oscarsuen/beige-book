District business conditions remained reasonably strong through the last six weeks of 2005; however, business spending was somewhat stronger than that for households.  In particular, holiday spending appears to have been weaker than the District's retailers had hoped for, while home and auto sales were down, and the provision of consumer credit was flat.  By contrast, commercial construction and credit issuance rose at the end of 2005.  In the manufacturing sector, durable goods producers saw shipment volumes rise, while shipments were steady for producers of nondurable goods.  Finally, trucking and shipping services providers continued to report robust demand.
Reports suggested that input cost increases were more modest as the year ended, however more firms mentioned attempting to increase their own prices to try to offset previous increases in input costs.  Overall, hiring still appeared somewhat limited throughout the District, though staffing services companies reported an increase in client orders, which was attributed to expectations of ongoing economic expansion in 2006.
Manufacturers generally reported that their overall input costs increased little through the last six weeks of 2005.  Nevertheless, most producers reported raising their own prices, in an effort to mitigate earlier increases in input costs.  Hiring appeared to strengthen somewhat among durable goods producers, but remains much more limited among nondurable goods producers.
Many retailers reported more markdowns and promotional activity throughout this holiday selling season than was true a year ago.  Several contacts suggested that some retailers' desire to move merchandise may have come at the expense of profits.  In addition, a few contacts noted that some sales were lost due to inventories that were managed "too" tightly.  Regarding hiring, one contact noted that there will be staffing reductions during the spring season as a result of this firm's poor sales performance over the holidays.
Sales at District auto dealerships were down during the last six weeks of 2005, despite aggressive promotions among the "Big Three".  As a result, dealers' inventories were generally characterized as above desirable levels.
Unlike homebuilders, commercial contractors ended 2005 with an increase in activity, relative to this period a year ago.  Additionally, business was better throughout 2005 for most firms than was true in 2004.  Commercial builders' backlogs were also characterized as good.  Most contacts reported that their firms had increased prices as the year ended, with some part of these increases intended to recoup earlier escalations in costs.  Through the last six weeks of 2005, commercial contractors reported modest increases in materials costs, often citing increases in the prices for fuel and drywall.  Only slight increases in some firms' workforces were reported.
