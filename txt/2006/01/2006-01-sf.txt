The Twelfth District economy continued to expand at a solid pace during the survey period of late November through the beginning of January.  Price inflation was modest overall, helped in part by recent declines in energy prices.  Contacts reported moderate wage increases in general, with more rapid increases reported for workers with specialized skills in selected industries.  Retail sales expanded during the holiday season, and service providers reported further demand growth.  Manufacturers and agricultural producers saw strong demand for their products.  Activity in residential real estate markets generally remained at high levels but slowed in some areas, while demand for commercial real estate improved further.  District banks reported steady loan demand overall and very good credit quality.
Wage increases reportedly were moderate on net, in the range of 3 to 5 percent on an annual basis.  However, the pace of wage growth was substantially more rapid for workers with specialized skills in the financial, construction, and health-care services sectors.  Employers' costs for employee benefits, particularly for health insurance, continued to rise more rapidly than wages.
Service providers reported continued strong demand.  Sales grew further in the food and beverage, health-care, media, and transportation sectors.  District travel and tourism activity remained vigorous, especially in Hawaii, where growth in visitor numbers and spending has been setting records and hotel occupancy rates have continued to rise.
