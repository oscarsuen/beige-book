Tourism has remained strong since the last report.  Manhattan hotels report brisk business in December, with the transit strike apparently having little net effect.  Occupancy rates remained close to 85 percent in December and were little changed from a year earlier, and total revenues were up roughly 15 percent--even during the week of the transit strike.  Broadway theaters report that both attendance and total revenues dipped noticeably during the week of the transit strike but bounced back strongly in the final week of December.  For the month as a whole, attendance was down marginally from a year earlier but revenues were still up 10 percent--down from gains of over 20 percent in October and November.
Consumer confidence in the region ended 2005 on a strong note.  Based on the Conference Board monthly survey of residents of the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, PA), consumer confidence posted its third consecutive monthly gain in December, rising to a five month high.
Commercial real estate markets across the New York City metropolitan area showed broad-based strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2005.  Vacancy rates in northern New Jersey, lower Manhattan and midtown Manhattan fell by at least  percentage point for the quarter and were down by roughly 2 points from the end of 2004.  Vacancy rates in Long Island and the lower Hudson Valley were down marginally.  Asking rents were up moderately across most of the region. Industrial markets were mixed in the fourth quarter: Long Island's industrial vacancy rate fell to a five-year low, but rates in Westchester and the lower Hudson Valley rose modestly, while northern New Jersey's rate was little changed.
Activity in goods production and distribution has also shown signs of expanding.  A major shipping firm reports a steady and substantial increase in the volume of merchandise exports shipped through the northern New Jersey ports in recent months.  This contact notes that 2005 was also a very strong year for incoming shipments at the port.  New York State manufacturers report favorable business conditions at the end of 2005 and express fairly widespread optimism about prospects for the first half of 2006, as well as some increase in hiring plans.  Manufacturers also note ongoing escalation in input prices, and a growing proportion report that they are hiking their selling prices.
