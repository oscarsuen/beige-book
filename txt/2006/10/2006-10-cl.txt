The District's economy showed modest growth since mid-August; however,   growth was mixed and there is concern about the sustainability of lower energy   prices and a continuing slowdown in the auto sector and residential construction.   Most district manufacturers reported steady production with production forecasted   to remain at current levels for the next six months. However, reduced activity   in the auto sector is tempering the outlook for some manufacturers. Retailers   experienced mixed sales activity with lower gas prices and cooler weather helping   boost sales at some District outlets. Commercial builders reported strong activity   but were concerned that inquiries were beginning to taper off. New home sales   continued to be soft with several builders saying they have no backlog. Banking   contacts reported a gain in core deposits and an increase in corporate borrowing.   And the demand for trucking and shipping services continues to soften.
On net, hiring across the District was steady. Staffing firms reported job   openings were moderately increasing in August and September with demand coming   from professional business services and healthcare. Wage pressures were not   seen as an issue at this time. Almost all contacts said that the rise in input   costs has moderated and cite a drop in energy prices as the reason. Manufacturers   attempting to raise their prices met with a mixed degree of success. Retailers   generally reported holding their prices steady.
Production at the District's nondurable goods facilities has been stable   since mid-August with higher levels reported on a year-over-year basis. Expectations   for the next six months are flat to up with some manufacturers saying that the   auto industry could affect their production levels. Most contacts reported idle   capacity--food producers being the exception. A majority of manufacturers   said capital expenditures were on target with no increases anticipated during   the next few months. Input costs were mixed following oil price fluctuations.   None of the contacts reported increasing employment in the past six weeks and   few said they plan to hire in the near future. Wage pressures are contained.
Overall, vendor prices have remained stable since mid-August which is reflected   in stable prices for customers. Contacts reported limited wage pressures and   are planning normal Christmas hiring.
Most contacts said that new car sales improved in August, but fell in September.   August is normally closeout time as dealers make a push to sell the remaining   prior year's inventory. SUVs continued to sell poorly and used car sales   were consistent with sales in past months.
The District's commercial contractors reported strong activity since   mid-August with an increase in business on a year-over-year basis. Most contacts   anticipate activity will remain strong through the first half of 2007 due to   project backlogs which remain at high levels--for one contractor, the highest   in five years. However, inquiries seem to be tapering off slightly which could   result in slowness about a year out. Segments reporting stronger activity were   health care, education, and public works. Material cost increases that were   prevalent over the past few months are slowing or have stabilized. Margins for   a few contacts have increased slightly due to a slower acceleration in costs.   Contractors reported little change in the size of their labor force.
