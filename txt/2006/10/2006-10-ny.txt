The Second District has shown signs of strengthening since the last report,   with few signs of increased price pressures. Labor markets have been steady   to stronger, according to firms in manufacturing and most service industries.   Manufacturers report steady growth in activity since the last report, along   with less widespread increases in input prices. Retailers indicate that sales   picked up in September, while prices remained flat. Tourism activity remained   robust in New York City, with both hotels and Broadway theaters reporting double-digit   increases in prices over the past year. Consumer confidence in the region rose   to a five-month high in September.
Housing markets have been mixed since the last report: New York City's   co-op and condo market has remained fairly strong, and the rental market has   tightened further; however, housing markets in New Jersey and upstate New York   show continued weakness. Commercial real estate markets across the New York   City metro area generally strengthened in the third quarter, for both office   and industrial space. Finally, bankers again report weakening in loan demand--particularly   for home mortgages--somewhat tighter credit standards in the commercial   sector, and little change in delinquency rates.
Tourism activity has been fairly steady at a high level since the last report.   The occupancy rate at Manhattan hotels edged up to 87 percent in August, slightly   higher than a year earlier, while room rates climbed more than 10 percent from   comparable 2005 levels. Broadway theaters report mixed results for September:   attendance was down roughly 3 percent from a year earlier, but total revenue   jumped 11 percent, reflecting sharply higher admission prices. Based on the   Conference Board's survey of Middle Atlantic (New York, New Jersey and   Pennsylvania) residents, consumer confidence, which had drifted down in July   and August, jumped to a 5-month high in September.
In contrast, Manhattan's co-op and condo market showed signs of resilience   in the third quarter. Based on quarterly data from a leading appraisal firm,   both the number of apartments sold and the price per square foot were up roughly   6 percent from a year earlier, despite a sharply higher inventory of available   units. Manhattan's rental market has tightened further since the last   report, particularly at the high end, reflecting a dearth of large rental units   on the market at the end of the third quarter; a major real estate firm estimates   that rents on studio and one bedroom apartments are up 5 to 10 percent from   a year earlier, while rents on larger units are up 10 to 15 percent.
Commercial real estate markets across the New York City area showed further   signs of tightening in the third quarter. In Manhattan, office vacancy rates   continued to edge down, reaching their lowest levels since early 2001, while   asking rents accelerated, rising more than 10 percent from a year earlier. One   industry contact notes that large blocks of space have become nearly impossible   to find in Midtown Manhattan. In the nearby suburban markets, vacancy rates   were also down from a year earlier and at or near cyclical lows, though rents   increased more moderately. The industrial market has been mixed but, on balance,   stronger in the third quarter: vacancy rates declined to cyclical lows in Long   Island, Westchester and Fairfield Counties, but continued to rise in northern   New Jersey.
