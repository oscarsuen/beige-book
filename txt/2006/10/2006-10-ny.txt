In contrast, Manhattan's co-op and condo market showed signs of resilience in the third quarter. Based on quarterly data from a leading appraisal firm, both the number of apartments sold and the price per square foot were up roughly 6 percent from a year earlier, despite a sharply higher inventory of available units. Manhattan's rental market has tightened further since the last report, particularly at the high end, reflecting a dearth of large rental units on the market at the end of the third quarter; a major real estate firm estimates that rents on studio and one bedroom apartments are up 5 to 10 percent from a year earlier, while rents on larger units are up 10 to 15 percent. Commercial real estate markets across the New York City area showed further signs of tightening in the third quarter. In Manhattan, office vacancy rates continued to edge down, reaching their lowest levels since early 2001, while asking rents accelerated, rising more than 10 percent from a year earlier. One industry contact notes that large blocks of space have become nearly impossible to find in Midtown Manhattan. In the nearby suburban markets, vacancy rates were also down from a year earlier and at or near cyclical lows, though rents increased more moderately. The industrial market has been mixed but, on balance, stronger in the third quarter: vacancy rates declined to cyclical lows in Long Island, Westchester and Fairfield Counties, but continued to rise in northern New Jersey. Other Business Activity Manufacturing contacts report steady improvement in business conditions since the last report, along with further abatement in price pressures. Manufacturers also indicate increased employment, along with higher levels of capital spending in the months ahead. Surveys of purchasing managers in the Buffalo, Rochester and New York City areas also indicate some lessening in price pressures in September, but signal some slowing in manufacturing activity. Outside of manufacturing, contacts in most industries report little change in overall business conditions, along with steady or rising employment levels; however, contacts in the publishing industry note some weakening in employment. Financial Developments Contacts at small to medium-sized banks in the 2nd District report decreased demand for all types of loans since the last report--particularly residential mortgages, for which more than two-thirds of bankers reported decreases. Respondents also continue to report widespread declines in refinancing activity. Bankers report tightened credit standards for commercial loans and mortgages, while standards remained unchanged for the consumer and residential mortgage categories. Bankers report little change in loan rates overall, with somewhat higher rates on consumer credit and commercial and industrial loans but somewhat lower rates on home mortgages. Delinquency rates are again reported to be little changed across all categories.
