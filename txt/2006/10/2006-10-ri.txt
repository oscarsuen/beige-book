Economic activity in the Fifth District expanded at a moderate pace in late   August and September, as firmer factory output and somewhat stronger store sales   were balanced against a continued weakening in housing markets. Manufacturing   shipments and new orders rebounded in September following a soft patch in August.   Retail sales increased more quickly outside of housing-related categories and   domestic automobiles. Revenues at services firms continued to expand on pace   with a notable pickup at computer-related businesses. Both construction and   sales of houses softened further in most markets, though activity edged higher   in a few areas. In banking, mortgage lending weakened, while commercial lending   was steady. Tourist activity was temporarily dented in early September by Hurricane   Ernesto, but held up in areas away from the coast. Labor markets remained generally   tight, with hiring increasing modestly at factories and services firms. Skilled   workers remained difficult to find, and some upward wage pressures were noted.   Price pressures were more pronounced in manufacturing, but the pace of increase   moderated in the services sector. In agriculture, substantial crop damage was   inflicted by Hurricane Ernesto in early September, but subsequent weather conditions   have been favorable for harvesting activity.
Commercial real estate agents across the Fifth District reported that leasing   activity remained steady in recent weeks. An agent in Richmond, Va., said that   client interest and inquiries increased, though actual activity had yet to improve.   A contact in Washington, D.C., however, noted a slowdown in retail leasing.   He speculated that a reduction of consumers' wealth had forced area retailers   to curb their expansion plans. On balance, there was little change in new construction   reported across the District. In addition, little change in vacancy and rental   rates was noted.
