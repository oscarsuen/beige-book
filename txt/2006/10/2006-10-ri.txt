Economic activity in the Fifth District expanded at a moderate pace in late   August and September, as firmer factory output and somewhat stronger store sales   were balanced against a continued weakening in housing markets. Manufacturing   shipments and new orders rebounded in September following a soft patch in August.   Retail sales increased more quickly outside of housing-related categories and   domestic automobiles. Revenues at services firms continued to expand on pace   with a notable pickup at computer-related businesses. Both construction and   sales of houses softened further in most markets, though activity edged higher   in a few areas. In banking, mortgage lending weakened, while commercial lending   was steady. Tourist activity was temporarily dented in early September by Hurricane   Ernesto, but held up in areas away from the coast. Labor markets remained generally   tight, with hiring increasing modestly at factories and services firms. Skilled   workers remained difficult to find, and some upward wage pressures were noted.   Price pressures were more pronounced in manufacturing, but the pace of increase   moderated in the services sector. In agriculture, substantial crop damage was   inflicted by Hurricane Ernesto in early September, but subsequent weather conditions   have been favorable for harvesting activity.
Manufacturing activity picked up in September. Manufacturers told us that shipments   grew briskly following a contraction in August, while new orders gained momentum   and employment growth remained on pace. Contacts in the electronic, plastics,   and printing and publishing industries reported particularly strong growth in   demand since our last report. A printing and publishing manufacturer in South   Carolina, for example, said that some firming of local economic and employment   conditions helped boost their revenues. A plastics producer reported that they   were "still busy with good projects," and an electronic equipment   manufacturer in Maryland indicated that their sales were notably stronger than   a year ago. In contrast, a producer of residential doors in North Carolina reported   a substantial decrease in orders. Factory hiring expanded on pace with recent   months and wages increased somewhat more quickly. Manufacturers told us that   raw material prices jumped higher in September and that prices for finished   goods rose moderately.
Commercial real estate agents across the Fifth District reported that leasing   activity remained steady in recent weeks. An agent in Richmond, Va., said that   client interest and inquiries increased, though actual activity had yet to improve.   A contact in Washington, D.C., however, noted a slowdown in retail leasing.   He speculated that a reduction of consumers' wealth had forced area retailers   to curb their expansion plans. On balance, there was little change in new construction   reported across the District. In addition, little change in vacancy and rental   rates was noted.
Tropical storm Ernesto brought much-needed rainfall to the Fifth District in   early September, but hindered field work and damaged crops in low-lying fields   in coastal regions. Analysts in North Carolina told us that tobacco farmers   in the state lost 25 percent of their crops because of flooding from Ernesto,   and incurred $76 million of crop damage across 19 counties. In South Carolina,   crop and other farm damage from Ernesto was estimated at $11.5 million. In contrast,   drier weather returned to the District during the latter part of September,   allowing farmers to keep harvesting activity on schedule. In Maryland, farmers   were beginning to harvest their soybean crops; the harvesting of corn and sowing   of barley were progressing well in Virginia, and the apple harvest was ahead   of schedule in West Virginia.
