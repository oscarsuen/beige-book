Agriculture Tropical storm Ernesto brought much-needed rainfall to the Fifth District in early September, but hindered field work and damaged crops in low-lying fields in coastal regions. Analysts in North Carolina told us that tobacco farmers in the state lost 25 percent of their crops because of flooding from Ernesto, and incurred $76 million of crop damage across 19 counties. In South Carolina, crop and other farm damage from Ernesto was estimated at $11.5 million. In contrast, drier weather returned to the District during the latter part of September, allowing farmers to keep harvesting activity on schedule. In Maryland, farmers were beginning to harvest their soybean crops; the harvesting of corn and sowing of barley were progressing well in Virginia, and the apple harvest was ahead of schedule in West Virginia.
