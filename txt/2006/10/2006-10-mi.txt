The Ninth District economy grew moderately since the last report. Increases   in activity were noted in consumer spending, commercial real estate, tourism,   agriculture, mining, and energy. Meanwhile, manufacturing activity was mixed,   commercial construction was steady, and residential real estate and construction   activity decreased. Labor markets tightened since the last report, and wage   increases were moderate. Significant price increases were noted for some building   materials, and significant decreases were noted in fuel and lumber.
An auto dealer in eastern Montana reported that sales were up slightly from   a year ago. A representative of an auto dealers association in North Dakota   noted that sales over the past two months were sluggish compared with last year.
Late summer and fall tourism activity was up slightly from last year. A Chamber   of Commerce representative in northwestern Wisconsin noted strong traffic during   a recent autumn event. The fall tourism season is starting to pick up in South   Dakota, according to an official; the pheasant hunting season looks promising.   A tourism official in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan noted positive reports   by tourism-related businesses during August and September. Some lodging operators   in northeastern Minnesota noted a slower August compared with last year.
Residential real estate continued to slide. August home sales in Minneapolis-St.   Paul were down 27 percent from 2005, with pending sales down 23 percent. Sales   were down 10 percent from last year in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan; the   market for recreational land is the only strong segment there. However, a representative   of a Realtors' association in Sioux Falls, S. D. described the market there   as on pace with last year's record-breaking levels, with lower priced homes   driving the market. The commercial sector stayed strong, however, particularly   the Minneapolis industrial market, which saw rising prices, according to an   official from a commercial real estate firm. The markets for retail space in   North Dakota and Montana are strong. Office vacancies crept up in the Minneapolis   and St. Paul central business districts.
Wage increases were moderate. Wages for manufacturing workers in District   states increased 1.8 percent for the three-month period ended in August compared   with a year ago. Workers at five hospitals in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area   recently agreed to a new contract that provides wage increases of 4 percent   in each of the first two years and 3 percent in the third, and employer contributions   to health insurance premiums will increase.
Significant price increases were noted in some building materials, and decreases   were noted in fuel and lumber. Prices for copper and brass mill shapes, steel   mill products, asphalt, and wire and cable were notably higher than a year earlier.   Meanwhile, gasoline prices decreased since the last report. In Minnesota, gasoline   prices toward the end of September were 49 cents per gallon lower than a year   ago and 75 cents lower than a month earlier. Regional prices for diesel fuel   were 23 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. Recent plywood and softwood   lumber prices were also down from last year.
