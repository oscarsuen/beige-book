The Eleventh District economy continued to cool from high levels in September.   Falling fuel prices increased profits and optimism for some firms, but increased   caution has crept into the residential construction and energy industries. Energy   activity is still robust, but drilling has paused amid growing concern about   a glut of natural gas in storage. Nonresidential construction is vigorous, and   residential building is strong but continuing to cool. Manufacturing activity   is also quite strong, despite slowing demand from residential builders. Retail   sales were up, and demand in the service sector is still very good, but there   continue to be pockets of softness. Financial service firms reported slower   consumer lending, but commercial lending remained strong. Rain has slightly   improved agricultural conditions.
After peaking near $78 in July, crude oil prices fell to near $60 in September.   Demand for crude oil has been strong, but inventories are well above last year's   level and the 5-year average. Wholesale gasoline prices fell about 50 cents   per gallon in September, and the pump price fell further. Distillate prices   fell less rapidly than gasoline because the winter heating season is approaching.   Spot natural gas prices dipped from about $6 to just over $4 per million Btu   at Henry Hub. Natural gas in storage is roughly 12 percent higher than the 5-year   average. Some producers say they are holding natural gas off of the market in   anticipation of the higher prices the futures market shows for winter. Other   producers are preparing but not perforating their natural gas wells, so they   can sell forward the initial surge of production at a higher price.
Home prices continued to rise in Houston, but in other cities softer demand   has led builders to add incentives. Apartment rental rates are edging up, but   at a slower pace than was expected earlier this year. Commercial builders reported   higher construction costs.
Demand continued to slow for products used in residential construction, but   some firms said recent slowing may have been partially weather-related. Producers   of stone, clay and glass reported sales declines of as much as 20 percent from   a year ago, and inventories are up for some products. Lumber producers reported   a significant drop in demand and increase in inventory over the past month,   mostly because of reduced demand from national markets, although sales in Texas   were also weaker. Producers of wood products, such as cabinets, say demand is   unchanged. A few producers of construction-related products report that some   large publicly-traded builders have sent letters asking for price reductions   to help them achieve quarterly income projections. This has led producers to   become wary about doing business with these builders.
Fabricated metals producers report no change in sales volume but had become   more optimistic. Demand for residential construction products has been soft,   but sales to the energy industry remain strong. Primary metals producers reported   little change in demand overall, with strong demand for commercial building   helping compensate for slowing activity from the residential sector.
Gulf Coast refineries continued to operate at very high levels, near 97 percent   in recent weeks. Gasoline demand fell seasonally but is still 4 percent stronger   than last year. Demand softened for synthetic rubber and ethylene. Plant outages   temporarily boosted ethylene prices, and contacts suggested recent weakness   in sales is a result of customers using inventory in anticipation of lower prices   in the weeks ahead.
Overall cargo shipping continued to increase, with some contacts noting particularly   strong international activity. Railroads reported strong demand, but there has   been a modest decline in trucking volume. Airlines reported a rebound in passenger   traffic, with good loads and bookings for long-haul and international flights.   Demand was reported as slower for short hops that are more affected by the increased   hassle of increased security restrictions.
The housing market continues to soften but remains quite strong. Sales are particularly   strong in Houston, Austin and El Paso. Dallas real estate agents say the "buying   fervor" is a little slower, but relocations and healthy job growth are   still boosting activity. New home inventories have inched up, despite strong   demand in some markets. Building is expected to slow from the rapid pace of   growth seen earlier this year. While the market remains strong, contacts have   become "more nervous and anxious" in their outlook, especially given   recent reports of a decline in housing sales and prices at the national level.
Apartment construction remains strong, and occupancies are still near or above   90 percent in most areas. In Dallas, demand for apartments picked up robustly   over the past couple of months, boosting occupancies and rents. Houston contacts   attribute some recent softness to the "Katrina effect" as evacuees   leave apartments for permanent residences. With many Houston projects in the   works, some contacts were concerned with the possibility of overbuilding.
Construction and demand for office space is still increasing. Contacts characterize   the Houston market as "the healthiest we've seen in a long time."   Dallas contacts say the large blocks of space have become more limited, shifting   pricing power to landlords.
Heavy supplies of natural gas have increased pipeline pressure in parts of   the country. Concern is rapidly growing about the possibility that a warm winter   would sustain lower prices. Drilling has not yet been cut, which contacts say   is partly because of the backlog of equipment and workers in the industry. Firms   are hesitant to give up a rig or their place in line for oilfield equipment   or services. While oil prices have fallen, this drilling is expected to be more   immune from a price downturn because oil projects are larger and based on conservative   outlooks for oil prices, have long-term horizons and deeper pockets behind them.
Most of the District continues to suffer from severe or extreme drought, but   September rain brought some relief. The moisture helped the wheat crop get off   to a good start, improved range and pasture conditions and eased pressure on   livestock producers to liquidate herds. Cotton harvesting is under way in some   parts of the District, and contacts say production will be 35 percent less than   last year. Contacts remain concerned that low crop production and rising costs   will make it difficult for producers to repay farm loans. Federal grants recently   made available under the livestock assistance program are expected to ease the   cash flow situation for some producers.
