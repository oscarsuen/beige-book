Reports from Sixth District contacts indicated that business activity was mixed   in September. District merchants reported that sales exceeded expectations,   although auto sales were mixed. Home sales and housing construction continued   to trend lower in Florida, and there were reports of declining housing market   activity in other areas as well. In contrast, nonresidential construction continued   to expand modestly. Real estate loan demand moderated further, and an increase   in foreclosures was noted in parts of the District. Reports on manufacturing   and tourism were generally positive. Labor shortages were a source of wage pressure   in some industries, and cost increases related to energy and raw material prices   continued to be reported. Several businesses noted they had successfully raised   their output prices to offset a portion of the higher input costs.
Reports from commercial builders indicated that nonresidential construction   in the District was slightly stronger in September compared with a year earlier.   However, contacts also reported that rising material costs caused highway and   road projects in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia to be scaled back. Most reports   anticipated continued modest growth in nonresidential activity over the next   several months.
Many of the companies contacted stated that they have been able to pass on   at least some of their cost increases to their customers. However, a concrete   products manufacturing company had to absorb recent energy, freight, and raw   material cost increases because of the slowdown in homebuilding. Property insurance   premium increases continued to be a major concern for businesses in coastal   areas of the District.
High energy prices and a calm hurricane season resulted in a significant expansion   of exploration in the Gulf of Mexico in recent months. According to initial   estimates, a new, large find in the deep waters of the Gulf has the potential   to double U.S. crude oil reserves.
