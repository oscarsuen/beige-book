Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity   continued to expand since the last report. Four Districts reported that economic   growth firmed while a couple of Districts noted that growth cooled. Other reports   generally characterized growth as moderate or mixed.
Consumer spending increased more quickly in a number of Districts, although   several reports continued to note that automobile and home-related sales were   sluggish. Tourism was generally strong and added some momentum in the New York   and Kansas City Districts. Activity in the service sector expanded in most Districts,   but Boston described activity as flat and Cleveland and Dallas identified pockets   of softness in some industries. Manufacturing conditions generally held up well,   with several Districts indicating that growth increased, though Philadelphia   reported that activity edged down. Commercial construction gained strength in   most of the country. Reports on residential real estate, however, indicated   widespread cooling with the majority of Districts citing lower asking prices,   rising inventories of homes on the market and softening sales. A number of reports,   however, indicated that residential activity increased in some markets. Financial   institutions continued to report that residential mortgage lending had tapered   off, but commercial lending activity picked up in several Districts. Agricultural   conditions generally improved as rainfall brought relief to drought-stricken   areas.
A number of Districts reported that labor markets were tight with some noting   shortages of skilled workers. Wage pressures were associated with tightening   conditions in a few Districts, though other reports noted that wage pressures   were in check. While the majority of Districts characterized price pressures   as contained, input prices increased in several Districts and a few reports   mentioned increased pass throughs by businesses.
Vehicle sales weakened in several Districts--particularly sales of domestic   automobiles, SUVs and light trucks. However, a few Districts reported increased   sales of foreign cars and fuel-efficient automobiles. Philadelphia noted that   a growing number of smaller automobile dealerships had closed and dealers in   the Atlanta District added incentives to move inventory. In the Dallas District,   sales of luxury vehicles increased.
Tourist activity strengthened since our last report. New York said that tourism   remained robust in New York City. Kansas City reported solid gains in hotel   occupancy rates, while tourist activity in the San Francisco District remained   at a high level despite some moderation. Tourism in the Richmond District was   temporarily dented by Hurricane Ernesto in early September, but rebounded later   in the month.
New York and St. Louis reported mixed housing activity. On the upside, Manhattan   condominium sales showed signs of resilience, and housing sales rose in Memphis,   but both Districts noted weakness in most markets. Richmond reported generally   weaker housing activity, but also noted increases in some markets. Atlanta said   that housing activity rose in its Mississippi Gulf market, and Minneapolis'   Sioux Falls market remained on pace with last year's record-breaking level.   Dallas reported particularly robust home sales in its Houston, Austin and El   Paso markets.
Commercial real estate markets were strong in most Districts, and activity   increased at a faster pace in a number. Leasing activity increased in New York,   Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco, and held steady in Richmond.   Chicago and St. Louis, however, said leasing activity was mixed. Rent increases   were reported by New York, Minneapolis and San Francisco, with Dallas indicating   that pricing power was shifting to landlords.
Nonresidential construction was generally strong. Construction activity was   steady in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts   and increased in the Chicago and Dallas Districts. Material costs and budget   concerns scaled back some projects in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts. The   Chicago and Minneapolis reports noted concerns among some contacts that commercial   construction may slow in the coming months.
Activity in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from the   Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. Minneapolis indicated   that alternative energy industries continued to expand at a rapid pace and that   mining production was at near-capacity across the District. Kansas City noted   that oil and gas drilling rig counts remained above year-ago levels, while San   Francisco said that oil and natural gas extraction continued at a rapid pace.   In contrast, Dallas reported that activity in the oil and energy producing sector   was virtually unchanged although demand for oil-field equipment and energy services   remained strong.
Wage growth around the nation was generally modest, although faster wage growth   for skilled services workers was cited by a number of Districts. The San Francisco   District noted that a short supply of healthcare, finance and construction workers   pushed wages higher. In addition, Richmond noted a sharp uptick in retail wages   and Atlanta reported that some manufacturers had raised entry-level wages in   an effort to attract workers.
Most Districts reported few signs of increased price pressures in recent weeks.   A number of Districts said that energy prices moderated, but increases in raw   materials prices were noted by Philadelphia, Richmond and Atlanta, and a rise   in building materials prices was reported by Minneapolis. Instances of businesses   passing on higher costs were scattered across Districts; Cleveland and Atlanta   said some manufacturers attempted to raise output prices while Boston reported   increases in retail prices. Boston also reported that costs for some businesses   had increased--especially for airfare and hotel accommodations. Likewise, the   New York District noted that accommodation and theatre ticket prices had risen   sharply compared to a year ago.
