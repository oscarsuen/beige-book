Economic activity in the Seventh District expanded at a moderate pace during   late August and September. Consumer spending continued to increase modestly,   and business spending expanded again. Labor market conditions were little changed,   with small gains in employment on net. Residential construction and real estate   activity declined again in most areas, while nonresidential construction advanced   at a steady pace. Manufacturing activity expanded again, though at a modestly   slower pace than in the previous reporting period. Mortgage lending declined,   while commercial lending increased at a slightly slower rate than in the previous   reporting period. Nonenergy price pressures and overall wage increases held   steady. Corn and soybean harvests in the District were delayed by cool and rainy   weather in September, and early results indicated mixed yields relative to a   year ago.
