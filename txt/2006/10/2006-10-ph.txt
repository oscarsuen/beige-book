Economic activity in the Third District increased in September, but conditions   varied by sector, and overall growth appears to have slowed. Manufacturing in   the District edged down from August to September. Retail sales of general merchandise   rose, but auto sales remained sluggish. Bank lending increased overall, although   mortgage lending declined. Service-sector activity continued to increase, but   the pace of growth has eased since midsummer.
Third District business contacts generally expect business activity in the   region to continue to expand but at a slow pace. Manufacturers expect improvement   but do not anticipate strong gains. Retailers forecast a modest growth in sales;   however, auto dealers do not expect sales to pick up. Bankers expect a further   decline in mortgage lending and slight gains in business and consumer lending.   Service-sector firms expect business to continue to move up slowly.
Overall, manufacturers expect demand for their products to improve, but their   outlook is not as optimistic as it was earlier this year. Among the manufacturers   contacted in September, slightly more than one-third expect their shipments   and orders to increase during the next six months, and about one-fourth expect   decreases. Capital spending plans reported by Third District manufacturers in   September rose somewhat from August. On balance, however, it appears that fewer   firms are scheduling increased outlays for 2007 than planned increases for 2006.
Auto sales in the region remained sluggish in September. Dealers said domestic   manufacturers’ incentives have done little to boost sales. Production   cutbacks have helped area dealers keep inventories manageable, although the   number of light trucks on dealers’ lots is still high. Auto dealers in   the region do not anticipate an improvement in sales in the near future. There   has been an increase in the number of dealerships closing in the past few months,   especially smaller ones.
Bankers in the District expect business and consumer lending to increase in   the months ahead, but not strongly. They also expect gains in credit card lending.   However, they anticipate a further decline in the demand for residential mortgages.   Some bankers also said they expect an increase in mortgage delinquencies as   payments of principal start to become due on non-amortizing mortgages and as   rates rise on adjustable-rate mortgages.
Employers in many industries reported that labor markets remain tight for   skilled workers, but the availability of unskilled workers has increased somewhat.   In service industries, firms report rising hiring rates and turnover among some   occupational specialties, especially in information technology. Area employers   indicated that wages have been rising slightly faster than at this time last   year, but the rate of increase has not accelerated in recent months.
