on residential mortgages, and some said the average creditworthiness of applicants for mortgages and consumer loans has declined recently. Bankers in the District expect business and consumer lending to increase in the months ahead, but not strongly. They also expect gains in credit card lending. However, they anticipate a further decline in the demand for residential mortgages. Some bankers also said they expect an increase in mortgage delinquencies as payments of principal start to become due on non-amortizing mortgages and as rates rise on adjustable-rate mortgages. Services Most of the Third District service firms contacted in September reported that activity was increasing, but for many firms growth has slowed recently. Business services firms generally indicated that they have experienced slower growth in work done for existing client firms and a slower pace of new client acquisition. Trucking firms reported significant slowdowns in the rate at which their business has been growing. Information technology firms have generally reported steady growth in the past few months. Employment agencies and temporary help firms reported that demand for workers has been rising at a nearly steady pace. Service-sector firms expect business to continue to advance, but they expect growth to remain slow, at best, in the months ahead. Prices and Wages Business firms in the Third District noted increases in the costs of raw materials and intermediate goods, although reports of price increases were not as widespread in September as they were earlier in the year. Manufacturers noted continued increases in prices for metals and energy. However, retailers generally indicated that selling prices have not been rising significantly, and they noted that discounting was widespread during the back-to-school shopping period. Employers in many industries reported that labor markets remain tight for skilled workers, but the availability of unskilled workers has increased somewhat. In service industries, firms report rising hiring rates and turnover among some occupational specialties, especially in information technology. Area employers indicated that wages have been rising slightly faster than at this time last year, but the rate of increase has not accelerated in recent months.
