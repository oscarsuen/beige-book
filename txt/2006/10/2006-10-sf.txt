Economic activity in the Twelfth District expanded at a moderate pace on net   during the month of September. Falling energy prices reduced upward pressures   on the final prices of some goods and services, while the pace of wage increases   generally remained contained but exerted upward price pressure in some industries.   Reports on retail sales suggested modest growth on net, while demand for most   services remained strong. Orders and output grew further for manufacturers and   agricultural producers. Residential real estate markets continued to cool, while   activity in commercial real estate markets generally expanded further but moderated   in some areas. District banks reported solid loan demand and good credit quality   but further declines in demand for residential mortgages.
Overall wage growth remained moderate, in the range of 2-4 percent on an annual   basis. Wage growth was more rapid for selected groups of workers in short supply,   notably in the health-care, finance, and construction sectors, and in fast-growth   areas with very tight overall labor markets, such as Idaho and Utah; however,   a few respondents in those areas indicated reduced wage pressures of late. Rising   labor costs were offset by enhanced production efficiency in most cases, but   a few reports indicated significant pass-through to final prices.
Service providers generally reported strong demand. Activity continued to   expand at a robust pace for providers of health services, and sales grew further   for providers of media and high-tech services. Tourist activity remained at   high levels in most major markets, but some moderation was noted. In Hawaii,   tourist visits and spending were down compared with a year earlier. In parts   of California, hotel occupancy rates reportedly have stabilized following a   prolonged climb, but room rates continued to rise.
