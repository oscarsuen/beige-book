Economic activity in the Twelfth District expanded at a moderate pace on net   during the month of September. Falling energy prices reduced upward pressures   on the final prices of some goods and services, while the pace of wage increases   generally remained contained but exerted upward price pressure in some industries.   Reports on retail sales suggested modest growth on net, while demand for most   services remained strong. Orders and output grew further for manufacturers and   agricultural producers. Residential real estate markets continued to cool, while   activity in commercial real estate markets generally expanded further but moderated   in some areas. District banks reported solid loan demand and good credit quality   but further declines in demand for residential mortgages.
District reports indicated that overall price inflation remained modest. Energy   prices fell noticeably in most areas, reducing the retail price of gasoline   and relieving upward price pressures for assorted energy-intensive products.   Contacts also noted a decline in the prices of selected building materials used   primarily for residential construction, although the prices of some other building   materials rose. More generally, respondents noted limited price pressures.
Overall wage growth remained moderate, in the range of 2-4 percent on an annual   basis. Wage growth was more rapid for selected groups of workers in short supply,   notably in the health-care, finance, and construction sectors, and in fast-growth   areas with very tight overall labor markets, such as Idaho and Utah; however,   a few respondents in those areas indicated reduced wage pressures of late. Rising   labor costs were offset by enhanced production efficiency in most cases, but   a few reports indicated significant pass-through to final prices.
Service providers generally reported strong demand. Activity continued to   expand at a robust pace for providers of health services, and sales grew further   for providers of media and high-tech services. Tourist activity remained at   high levels in most major markets, but some moderation was noted. In Hawaii,   tourist visits and spending were down compared with a year earlier. In parts   of California, hotel occupancy rates reportedly have stabilized following a   prolonged climb, but room rates continued to rise.
Demand for District manufactured products grew further during the September   survey period. Sales of semiconductors expanded at a solid pace that was in   line with industry forecasts, although inventories reportedly rose slightly;   capacity utilization generally remained in the range of 90 percent. Rapid production   activity continued for producers of commercial aircraft and for their parts   suppliers, while makers of machine tools reported substantial growth in new   orders of late. Food processors reported further sales gains, and demand for   apparel was "steady." By contrast, demand for selected building materials used   primarily for residential construction fell further. Except for tight supplies   of skilled workers in some areas, manufacturing contacts generally reported   little or no constraints on their ability to expand output further.
