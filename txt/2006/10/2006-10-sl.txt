Economic activity in the Eighth District expanded modestly since our previous   survey. Reports from manufacturing continued to be positive and contacts indicated   that the services sector continued to grow. Reports from contacts in residential   real estate markets were mixed; similarly, commercial real estate market conditions   varied across the District. Total loans at a sample of small and mid-sized District   banks increased slightly from mid-June to the end of August.
The District's services sector continued to expand. Firms in the freight   transportation, recreation, and professional business services industries reported   plans to build new facilities and expand operations. In contrast, a firm in   the business support services industry reported plans to close a facility in   the District. Car dealers in the District reported that sales from late August   through early September were down, on average, over year-earlier levels. Sales   of domestic cars and sport utility vehicles were particularly slow.
Commercial real estate market conditions continued to be mixed throughout   the District. In Little Rock, the second-quarter 2006 industrial vacancy rate   increased slightly, the downtown office vacancy rate decreased, and the suburban   office vacancy rate increased. Contacts in east Memphis reported high demand   for Class A office space. Contacts in Little Rock reported that several large   construction projects are expected or underway. Contacts in northeast Arkansas   reported that commercial building remains slow, while contacts in Madison County,   Tennessee, reported that commercial construction is booming. In St. Louis, contacts   reported that new industrial construction is vibrant.
Ample rainfall in much of the District since August slowed harvesting progress   in some areas. The District's overall corn harvest is behind its average   pace by 14 percent because of slower-than-normal paces in Illinois, Indiana,   and Kentucky; the soybean harvest is behind by 20 percent because of slower-than-normal   paces in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Missouri; and the sorghum harvest   is behind by 4 percent because of the slower-than-normal pace in Illinois. In   contrast, the cotton harvest in Arkansas and Mississippi is ahead of its normal   pace by 88 percent, while the rice harvest is ahead by 12 percent. The rain   improved pasture conditions in all District states, but at least one-third of   the pastures in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee still remain   in poor condition.
