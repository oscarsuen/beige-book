The District's overall corn harvest is behind its average pace by 14 percent because of slower-than-normal paces in Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky; the soybean harvest is behind by 20 percent because of slower-than-normal paces in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Missouri; and the sorghum harvest is behind by 4 percent because of the slower-than-normal pace in Illinois. In contrast, the cotton harvest in Arkansas and Mississippi is ahead of its normal pace by 88 percent, while the rice harvest is ahead by 12 percent. The rain improved pasture conditions in all District states, but at least one-third of the pastures in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee still remain in poor condition.
