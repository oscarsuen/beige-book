The Twelfth District economy expanded at a solid pace during the survey period of March through mid-April.  Contacts reported modest wage and price inflation on net, although wage growth remained rapid for selected worker groups with specialized skills in some industries.  Retail sales rose, owing in part to a rebound in auto sales, and demand for services was strong.  Output and sales grew significantly in most manufacturing sectors and for producers of agricultural and resource-related products.  Residential construction, sales activity, and price appreciation slowed slightly in most areas, while the demand for commercial real estate grew further.  District banks reported strong loan demand on net and very good credit quality.
Overall wage increases remained moderate on net, with numerical reports for broad worker groups in the range of 3 to 4 percent on an annual basis.  However, availability remained tight and wage increases remained relatively rapid for some groups of workers with specialized skills, notably in the financial, construction, health-care services, information technology, and professional services sectors.  Contacts also noted that employers' costs for employee benefits, particularly for health insurance, continued to rise more rapidly than wages.
Activity in the services sector generally was vibrant, with some exceptions.  Demand remained strong in the health-care services, professional services, and transportation sectors, while conditions were mixed for providers of information technology and media services.  District travel and tourist activity expanded further from very high levels, although contacts in Hawaii and California noted that hotel occupancies have been leveling off.  Contacts also noted general growth in demand for air travel and improved financial performance by major carriers.
