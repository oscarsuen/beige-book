Foreign models continued to have better year-to-year sales comparisons than domestic models.  Sales have slowed for vehicles that are not eligible for manufacturers' incentives.

Bankers in the District expect moderate growth in business and consumer lending in the months ahead but foresee further weakening in residential mortgage lending.
