Eighth District economic activity expanded modestly since the previous survey. During March, the service sector continued to grow, and manufacturing showed signs of continued improvement. Many contacts in retail trade reported gains relative to last year, although reports from auto dealers indicated decreases in sales relative to this time in 2005. Commercial construction activity continued to increase, while home sales and single-family residential permits in January and February varied across the District. Total lending activity among small and mid-sized banks remained steady.
The District's service sector continued to expand in most areas. Contacts in the business support, warehousing, and health services industries reported plans to expand their workforces. Contacts in the freight transportation industry reported strong demand for their services. Most District retailers reported increases in sales of 5 to 10 percent over March 2005 levels. Clothing, building materials, and "big box" retailers reported especially strong growth. Auto sales during March, in contrast, remained below 2005 levels in most areas of the District. Domestic and sport utility vehicles, as well as trucks, experienced the largest decreases in sales. Several auto dealers also reported that sales of luxury models were "soft." Imports and used vehicles fared better, with sales of these described as "relatively brisk" in some areas of the District.
Commercial real estate markets in the District continued to grow. Contacts in southern Indiana reported that commercial construction was active, and contacts in northeast Arkansas reported that a number of projects were being planned. Reports indicated strong commercial construction activity in Little Rock, and contacts in St. Louis reported that, in terms of square footage, commercial construction for 2006 would surpass commercial construction projects completed in 2005. Contacts in west Tennessee reported positive expectations for commercial and industrial construction for 2006, and contacts in northeast Mississippi reported that a large industrial project was recently announced for that area.
