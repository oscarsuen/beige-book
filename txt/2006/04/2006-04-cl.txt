Economic activity continued to show steady gains throughout the District in March and early April.  Manufacturers saw steady increases in production in the six weeks through the middle of April, relative to earlier this year.  Construction activity also appeared to strengthen, though rates of home building were below those of this time last year.  Commercial lending remained relatively robust.  And the demand for trucking and shipping services was strong and broad-based.  While retailers reported that sales were weaker-than-expected in March and early April, this was thought to be partly attributable to Easter's arrival in April.
In general, hiring remained relatively limited across the District.  For firms that were hiring, outside of a few specialties, employers appeared able to find the workers they needed; there were no reports of any accumulating wage pressure.  Staffing services companies, however, did report that those seeking jobs were able to find them more quickly than in the recent past.  Regarding cost pressures, contacts reported increases in the prices for cement, various metals, and petroleum products, and some ability to pass price increases through to end users.  Nevertheless, retail prices remained relatively flat.
Production showed slight increases for many manufacturers of nondurable goods in March and early April, relative to earlier this year.  And new orders showed increasing strength as well, suggesting that production may continue to improve in the months ahead.  Nevertheless, current production levels remain less than those of a year ago.  In general, nondurable goods manufacturers are not investing in additional capacity.  Most firms are also not adding to their staffs.  Like durable goods producers, many nondurable goods manufacturers mentioned increases in metals and petroleum prices, though some petroleum-derived products were actually less expensive than earlier this year.
Sales of new and used automobiles improved slightly in March, relative to the beginning of this year.  However, sales of new domestic nameplates remained at relatively lower levels.  Contacts reported attempting to more effectively manage their inventories, and trim the number of vehicles on their lots, given that holding costs have increased.
For firms involved in commercial construction, sales increased slightly relative to earlier this year, and were also up relative to a year ago.  In addition, most commercial contractors reported that their backlogs were strong.  Demand was driven in part by health care providers and educational establishments; construction of new office space was relatively less robust.  Increases in materials costs were more widely reported among commercial contractors.  Many builders reported increases in steel, cement, and petroleum-product prices.  Still, most builders have been able to pass through these costs increases.  Hiring remained relatively limited in the industry, and while subcontractors seem to be readily available at present, some contacts were concerned that there will be shortages soon.
