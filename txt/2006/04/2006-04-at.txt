Reports from Sixth District business contacts were mostly positive in March and early April. Merchants experienced modestly increasing sales, while vehicle sales were little changed over the month. Real estate contacts noted softening sales in some parts of the District, and declining sales in Florida. Residential construction remained strong throughout the region as builders worked off backlogs. Nonresidential sales and construction improved overall, but there were some reports of commercial projects being delayed because of rising costs. Manufacturing reports were mixed.  Strong demand boosted production and hiring in some manufacturing sectors, while layoffs were announced in others. The demand for transportation services remained robust. Reports from the tourism industry were positive, although rising gasoline prices and concerns about the upcoming hurricane season clouded the outlook. Commercial and industrial lending activity strengthened while residential loans slowed in parts of the District. Labor market conditions remained firm with numerous reports of labor shortages, especially in skilled positions. Contacts again cited high prices for building materials, energy, and industrial inputs, while firms' ability to pass on higher costs to consumers varied.
The overall pace of vehicle sales was little changed. Contacts noted that imports continued to gain market share while domestic dealers reported lower sales. The demand for fuel efficient vehicles increased.  Commercial fleet sales by domestic automakers declined from earlier in the year.
District commercial real estate markets continued to experience stronger levels of demand, but overall development remained at low levels. There were scattered reports of projects put on hold or delayed because of rising construction costs.  Some contacts noted that projects have been scaled back or redesigned in an effort to rein in costs.  The pace of redevelopment along the Gulf Coast remains slow and debris removal continues to dominate activity.
Energy costs were noted as a constraining factor in most industries, and higher input prices continued to affect manufacturers and builders. The ability to pass on higher costs to customers varied across firms. Contacts noted that more building contractors were adding a margin to their quotes to try and protect themselves against further input price increases.  However, those with fixed contracts have been unable to pass along cost increases, and some firms have reportedly delayed projects as a consequence.  Oil service companies have been able to increase prices for equipment and services because of strong demand.
