The Ninth District economy grew since the last report. Increases in activity   were noted in consumer spending, manufacturing, energy, mining, and agriculture.   Meanwhile, tourism activity was mixed, and residential real estate and construction   activity decreased. Signs of a tighter labor market were noted. Overall price   increases were modest as fuel prices decreased.
Overall tourism activity was mixed. Fall tourism in northern Minnesota and   Wisconsin was up from last year, according to Bank directors. The number of   deer hunting licenses issued this fall was slightly above last year's level   in Minnesota. After a strong September, October tourism activity was down about   7 percent from last year's level in western South Dakota, according to an official.   Crossings at the International Bridge in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were   down 6 percent in October compared with a year ago.
Commercial real estate activity continued at a fast pace. Industrial, retail   and office markets in the Minneapolis area saw positive absorption in the third   quarter; office absorption is expected to top 1 million square feet there by   year end, and lease rates are rising. Residential real estate continued to slide.   The median home sales price for Minneapolis-St. Paul fell 1 percent in October,   and closed sales were down almost 20 percent. A Bank director in Billings, Mont.,   reported that home sales were down slightly from a year earlier, but dollar   volumes were down more. Preliminary results indicate more than three-quarters   of respondents to the Minneapolis Fed's business outlook poll (November) expect   housing starts to be down in their communities this year, but most don't expect   that to adversely affect their sales, profits, investment or hiring.
However, in Minnesota almost 300 jobs at a department store's head offices   and a distribution center will be eliminated by next spring, a vending machine   manufacturer recently laid off 200 workers, a printing services provider will   close a plant resulting in 72 job losses and a newspaper plans to eliminate   about 40 positions. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a manufacturer announced   plans to lay off 170 workers.
Overall wage increases were moderate. The aforementioned business outlook   poll showed nearly three-quarters of respondents expect wages and salaries in   their community's businesses to increase between 2 percent and 3 percent. However,   a member of the Advisory Council on Small Business and Labor reported that wages   at mines in Montana were up over 10 percent and generous signing bonuses have   been offered.
Overall price increases were modest as prices for fuel declined. Prices for   many fuels and natural gas were down since the last report. Mid-November gasoline   prices in Minnesota were about the same as they were at the end of September,   but down 81 cents per gallon since August. Price increases were noted for roofing   shingles and foam rubber.
