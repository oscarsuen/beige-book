Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to expand at a moderate   pace on net during the survey period of October through mid-November. Reduced   energy prices reversed upward price pressures for some products, while the pace   of wage growth remained contained overall but exerted upward price pressures   in some industries and areas. District retailers generally reported improved   sales and service providers saw strong demand. Orders and output grew further   for most manufacturers and agricultural producers. District housing markets   continued to cool, while demand for commercial real estate expanded but at a   slower pace than previously. Banks reported solid loan demand and good credit   quality in general.
Overall wage growth remained moderate. However, wage growth continued to be   more rapid for selected groups of skilled workers, notably in the health-care,   finance, and construction sectors, and in areas with very tight labor markets   overall, such as Idaho and Utah. Scattered reports also suggested employers   were becoming increasingly reliant on using hiring bonuses to recruit skilled   workers who are in short supply. These compensation increases exerted noticeable   upward pressure on final prices in some cases.
Service providers reported generally strong demand. Sales grew significantly   in the food and beverage, health-care, and transportation sectors. Contacts   in various sectors reported that fuel surcharges have been trimmed due to lower   energy costs, reducing the price of transportation services. Overall tourist   activity remained at high levels, although a Southern California contact noted   that recent convention business there has not kept pace with last year.
