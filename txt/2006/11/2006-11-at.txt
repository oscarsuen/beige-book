Reports from Sixth District contacts indicated that business activity remained   mixed for October through mid-November. Retail sales were described as modest   while auto sales were varied. Construction activity continued to decline, as   cuts to residential building were only partially offset by modest growth in   nonresidential development. Manufacturing reports were mixed. For instance,   defense-related industries noted stronger activity, while building material   suppliers reported weaker demand. Transportation firms also observed slower-than-expected   demand. Banking conditions were little changed. Shortages of workers in several   professional and technical occupations were noted throughout the District, and   lower-skilled workers were in short supply on the Gulf Coast and in South Florida.   These shortages were being reflected in higher wages. Most industrial contacts   noted that input prices had moderated.
District auto sales remained uneven across vehicle brands and market areas.   Domestic auto dealers reported soft sales, while imports continued to gain market   share. High inventory levels caused a large South Florida-based auto dealer   to cut fourth-quarter orders from domestic automakers by 30 percent. Contacts   from regional import distributors reported stronger October performances, with   regional sales better than comparable sales nationally.
Growth in nonresidential construction remained modest, with infrastructure   repairs and improvements continuing to dominate activity in the District. The   most significant increase in activity was noted in Louisiana. Most commercial   builders continued to expect modest growth in the coming months, although the   pace of activity is expected to accelerate along the Gulf Coast.
Trucking contacts reported disappointing freight demand, with much of the   weakness concentrated in the retail and building materials sectors. Trucking   industry contacts in Atlanta noted that retailers were not increasing inventories   to the levels usually seen at the beginning of the holiday-shopping season.   Trucking firms servicing the construction industry reported a decline in orders.
Most reports indicated that commodity prices had moderated. According to construction   industry contacts, lumber prices dropped in November. Also, energy and related   feedstock costs have declined for industrial users. Pulp and paper, chemical,   and plastics manufacturers noted that costs for their oil and gas inputs had   eased, and this has helped profitability. Some reports also noted that the decline   in gasoline prices was feeding through to lower fuel surcharges on shipping.
