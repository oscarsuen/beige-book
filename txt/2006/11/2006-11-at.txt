Tourism and Business Travel Most reports from the tourism industry were positive. Attendance at major trade shows and conventions increased in central Florida. Nashville and Atlanta's hospitality industry also reported improved business, with hotels enjoying increasing occupancy rates. Mississippi Gulf Coast gaming revenues were near pre-Katrina levels in September and October as many of the damaged casinos have re-opened. According to gaming officials, employment at the casinos on the Mississippi Gulf Coast had also returned to near pre-hurricane levels. Banking and Finance Overall banking conditions were little changed in October. Weak loan demand continued to be noted in most parts of the District, lead by lower levels of mortgage lending. Deposit growth was mixed, with some parts of the District noting strong deposit growth, while others observed flat to slow growth in October and early November. Credit quality remained strong in the region. Commercial and industrial lending slowed overall, though there were reports of stronger demand in southern Louisiana. Employment and Prices Skilled workers remained in short supply in parts of the District. Contacts in South Florida and Nashville noted shortages of nurses, while North Alabama reported difficulty filling engineering positions. In Louisiana, shortages of skilled workers in the energy extraction industry were noted. Some shortages were posted for other types of labor as well, especially along the Gulf Coast and South Florida. An Alabama temporary staffing firm has seen increased demand from manufacturing and defense-related companies. In addition, some retail contacts expressed concern about their ability to find additional workers for the holiday period, and some holiday-related temporary positions have experienced higher wages as a result. Wage increases were also reported in the hotel, financial services, and healthcare industries. Some layoffs in the construction industry were reported in Florida, and wages were said to be stabilizing. Most reports indicated that commodity prices had moderated. According to construction industry contacts, lumber prices dropped in November. Also, energy and related feedstock costs have declined for industrial users. Pulp and paper, chemical, and plastics manufacturers noted that costs for their oil and gas inputs had eased, and this has helped profitability. Some reports also noted that the decline in gasoline prices was feeding through to lower fuel surcharges on shipping.
Agriculture and Natural Resources Poultry and livestock producers reported an escalation of feed costs, partly resulting from the growing use of corn for ethanol production. Most of the post-hurricane infrastructure repair work has been completed in the District's energy sector.
