In October and the first half of November, the Eleventh District economy continued   to decelerate from high levels. While there remains strength in the manufacturing,   construction, finance and service sectors, there are also areas of softness.   Many industries reported increased caution about the outlook. Energy activity   was strong overall, but there was still little change in the rig count. Retail   sales were weaker than expected. Manufacturing activity remained strong to supply   the energy industry but continued to report slowing sales to residential building.   Service sector activity was also mixed, with a dip in demand for temporary workers.   Nonresidential building is strong, but home sales and home building weakened   further. Financial service firms reported softer consumer lending, but credit   quality is healthy and commercial lending is good. Agricultural conditions improved   over the past six weeks.
Other prices were mixed. Overall home prices are unchanged, but prices have   declined in some metropolitan areas, particularly in Dallas and Fort Worth.   Building costs to supply nonresidential construction are unchanged, but prices   are lower for products supplying home building. Paper prices were unchanged,   but prices of corrugated boxes were lower. Accounting firms raised fees to cover   rising salaries. Prices for corn, grain sorghum and wheat were up sharply.
While the labor market remains tight, softening sales have led some manufacturers   to slow hiring as a precaution. The shortage of qualified truck drivers seems   to have eased some.
Gulf Coast refineries are now operating at high levels. The return from maintenance   was delayed in some cases by labor and construction shortages or by relatively   weak margins that offered less incentive to produce. Refining margins have been   strong by historical standards, but are only half to one-third of the high margins   enjoyed over the summer.
Petrochemicals were mixed. Ethylene production was affected by a series of   planned and unplanned outages that have supported prices and kept profit margins   high. There was a sharp seasonal decline in demand for polyethylene, and the   decline in homebuilding has hurt demand for PVC pipe. In contrast, demand for   synthetic rubber is very strong. Prices are high, and margins are excellent.   Demand for isobutylene, used in many consumer products, weakened in September   and October but returned strongly and has been pushing capacity limits in early   November.
Shipping firms report good demand but anticipate slower growth in coming months.   Cargo volumes remained flat and continued to be buoyed by domestic demand for   nondurable goods. Container trade activity rose sharply, with growth partly   coming from an increase in steel imports. Railroads indicated no change in overall   volumes but noted that shipments of lumber, wood and other building products   were down substantially over the past month. Trucking firms said demand softened   further which, according to contacts, helped ease the shortage of truck drivers   in the industry. Airlines report continued good demand overall.
Demand for autos remains soft, although lower gasoline prices have resuscitated   sales of some domestic vehicles. There were reports of higher than desired inventories.
Apartment demand remained solid, and rents are rising. Despite the departure   of Katrina evacuees, apartment occupancies are at or above 90 percent in most   Texas metros. Multifamily construction activity was still strong, but contacts   said a shortage of building sites and high construction costs have held back   construction of Dallas-area apartments.
Demand for office space remains strong, and rents continue to increase. Contacts   say investor interest remains high. Occupancy rates are edging up--and in Austin   have reached a five-year high. A Houston respondent said rents were up dramatically   in some areas. Office construction continues in all major metros. Dallas contacts   remain optimistic that demand will be sufficient to absorb the increased volume   of speculative projects currently under construction.
Contacts are cautious about weak natural gas prices and rising drilling costs,   and say that drilling for natural gas in high cost areas is the most vulnerable.   Firms have completed extensive hiring and training of new employees and made   large commitments to internal capital expansion and R&D. Companies say they   can shift crews and equipment across basins or around the world, wherever backlogs   continue.
