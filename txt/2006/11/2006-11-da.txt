Construction and Real Estate District home sales continued to slow, but activity has been mixed. Sales are still strong in some areas, such as Houston, but sales and traffic are down significantly in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Cancellations have edged up, especially for lower priced homes. Homebuilders and real estate agents noted increased uncertainty and uneasiness among buyers that they blamed partly on reports of weakness in other parts of the country. Builders have pulled back on starts and increased buyer incentives in an attempt to manage rising inventories. Apartment demand remained solid, and rents are rising. Despite the departure of Katrina evacuees, apartment occupancies are at or above 90 percent in most Texas metros. Multifamily construction activity was still strong, but contacts said a shortage of building sites and high construction costs have held back construction of Dallas-area apartments. Demand for office space remains strong, and rents continue to increase. Contacts say investor interest remains high. Occupancy rates are edging up--and in Austin have reached a five-year high. A Houston respondent said rents were up dramatically in some areas. Office construction continues in all major metros. Dallas contacts remain optimistic that demand will be sufficient to absorb the increased volume of speculative projects currently under construction. Financial Services Consumer lending continued to slow for all types of products, including mortgages, credit cards, personal and auto loans. Credit quality is still good, and mortgage delinquencies do not appear to be a problem for District lenders. Commercial lending is very good, although contacts expect activity to slow. Competition for experienced and talented lenders continues to be intense. Energy Energy activity remained generally strong, but the rig counts continued to be mostly unchanged in the United States and Texas. Oil service companies are working through an extensive backlog of orders, and there are still shortages of people and equipment. Day rates continue to rise but more slowly than earlier in the year. International activity continued to grow strongly. Contacts are cautious about weak natural gas prices and rising drilling costs, and say that drilling for natural gas in high cost areas is the most vulnerable. Firms have completed extensive hiring and training of new employees and made large commitments to internal capital expansion and R&D. Companies say they can shift crews and equipment across basins or around the world, wherever backlogs continue. Agriculture Recent rains boosted cattle grazing conditions, and many producers are optimistic they will get a good cutting of hay before the first freeze. Still, supplemental feeding of herds continues in the driest regions, and rapidly rising feed costs--particularly for corn--have substantially lowered calf prices. Rain has helped wheat and oat crops get off to a good start, but were too late for cotton, pecan, peanut, soybean and sorghum. Harvest of these crops is underway, and yields are better than expected but below last year's levels.
