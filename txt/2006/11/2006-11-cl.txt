Economic activity in the Fourth District grew at a moderate pace since early   October; however, the housing market, restructuring in the auto sector, and   some raw material prices have tempered enthusiasm. Production at District manufacturers   was steady to increasing with the expectation that production will remain at   current levels for the next six months. Several commercial builders report activity   has slowed, but business remains relatively strong overall. New residential   construction was mixed with a few builders experiencing a pick-up in activity.   Sales by District retailers were more in line with expectations after a somewhat   disappointing September. Loan demand at District banks was flat while core deposits   were up slightly. And the demand for trucking and shipping services continues   to soften.
On net, hiring across the District was stable. Staffing firms reported increased   job openings since early October with some contacts saying that openings were   up across the board. Wage pressures are not seen as an issue at this time. Almost   all contacts said that, with the exception of metals, the rise in input costs   continues to moderate. Manufacturers attempting to raise their prices met with   a mixed degree of success. And almost all retailers reported that they were   holding their prices steady.
Production levels at the District's nondurable goods facilities were steady   to increasing since early October and on a year-over-year basis. Expectations   for the next six months are mixed with one manufacturer saying that the auto   industry could affect their output. About half of our contacts reported idle   capacity. Most manufacturers said capital expenditures met or exceeded projections;   further, about half expect to increase spending during the next few months.   Input costs were relatively stable. Most manufacturers said they have no plans   to hire in the near future and three reported reducing their workforce during   the past six weeks. Wage pressures remain contained.

The District's commercial contractors reported that activity has slowed since   early October, but remains relatively strong overall. Most contacts have experienced   an increased level of business on a year-over-year basis. Contractors are anticipating   a strong first half in 2007 due to current backlogs and stable inquires. Segments   continuing to show strong activity are health care and public works; manufacturing-related   construction is beginning to pick-up. Material cost increases continue to slow   or have stabilized which is contributing to a small increase in profit margins.   Contractors reported little change in the size of their workforce, although   a few have hired or are looking to hire.
