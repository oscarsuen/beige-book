Transportation Demand for trucking and shipping services continues to soften with a slight volume decrease on a year-over-year basis. Most contacts reported a slowdown in the shipment of auto-related products. Trucking companies continue to pass on fuel costs using surcharges; however, it's becoming more difficult due to competition and customer resistance. Trucking companies were hiring, but activity was limited to finding replacements due to driver turnover. One contact reported laying-off workers. Wages have remained stable during the past six weeks.
