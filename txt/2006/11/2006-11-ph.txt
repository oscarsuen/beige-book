Economic conditions in the Third District improved slightly in November. Manufacturers   posted small increases in shipments, but there were also marginal declines in   new orders. Retail sales of general merchandise rose. However, auto sales did   not increase. Bank lending increased overall, although not strongly, but mortgage   lending declined. Residential real estate activity continued to decrease; by   contrast, commercial real estate markets tightened further.
Third District business contacts generally expect business activity to continue   to expand, but at a slow pace; however, they anticipate further softening in   residential real estate. Manufacturers expect some improvement during the winter.   Retailers are forecasting increased sales for the upcoming holiday season compared   to a year ago. Auto dealers do not expect sales to pick up in the near future.   Bankers anticipate slight gains in business and consumer lending but a further   decline in mortgage lending. Residential real estate agents and builders expect   further slowing in home sales through the winter. Contacts in commercial real   estate expect demand for office and industrial space to remain strong.
Third District manufacturers reported little change in business conditions from   October to November. On balance, they reported a slight increase in shipments   and a slight decrease in new orders. The decrease in orders affected most of   the region's major manufacturing sectors, although makers of food products and   apparel generally noted rising demand. Area manufacturers reported an easing   in order backlogs but also a small increase in delivery times.
Overall, manufacturers expect demand for their products to increase, but they   are not forecasting strong gains. Among the manufacturers contacted in November,   a little more than one-third expect their shipments and orders to increase during   the next six months; about one-fifth expect decreases. The capital spending   plans of Third District manufacturers increased between October and November.   On balance, however, the number of firms scheduling increased outlays remained   below the number that raised capital spending earlier in the year.
Auto sales in the region showed no signs of increasing in November, and some   dealers reported a slowing in sales. Year-to-year sales comparisons continued   to be better for foreign makes than for domestic makes. Inventories remained   above desired levels for many dealers but did not appear to be increasing. Auto   dealers in the region expect sales to remain sluggish through the winter, and   they say the outlook for 2007 is uncertain.
Bankers in the District expect business and consumer lending to increase slowly   in the months ahead, but they foresee a further decline in the demand for residential   mortgages. Bankers noted that both business and personal loan quality was good.   However, several bankers said they are concerned that builders, land developers,   and other firms involved in residential real estate and construction might soon   face cash flow problems, and they are monitoring these borrowers closely.
Residential real estate agents and homebuilders surveyed in November indicated   that sales were declining, continuing the sharp slowdown that began during the   summer. Real estate contacts noted that the number of existing homes for sale   and the time they are on the market have risen. Home builders reported significant   increases in cancellations. They have reduced prices for resold houses and increased   the value of free upgrades for all houses sold. Price appreciation of existing   homes in recent months has been well below the pace recorded over the past few   years. Homebuilders and real estate agents expect the pace of sales to slow   further during the winter. While most expect sales to recover next spring, several   said they do not anticipate a substantial rebound.
Employers in many industries reported that labor markets remain tight for   skilled workers and some professional occupations. Retailers noted that they   have had some difficulty in hiring temporary sales workers for the holiday season.   In contrast, the slowdown in residential construction has resulted in greater   availability of construction workers. Area employers indicated that wages have   been rising at a nearly steady rate in the past few months, somewhat above the   rate of increase recorded earlier this year and a year ago.
