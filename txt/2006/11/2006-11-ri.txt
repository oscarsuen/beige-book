Economic activity in the Fifth District expanded at a somewhat stronger pace   from late October through mid November, despite continued sluggishness in housing   markets. Revenues at services firms grew slightly faster, aided by firmer demand   at health care organizations and government contractors. Retail sales grew briskly,   despite sluggishness in most big-ticket categories. Manufacturing reversed its   October dip, posting increased shipments and orders in recent weeks. Commercial   leasing remained strong, while housing activity continued to weaken somewhat,   with softer prices more in evidence. Mortgage lenders, however, noted some firming   in loan demand following several months of weakening activity. Tourism was healthy,   with most areas reporting gains in recent weeks. Labor markets tightened further,   with some reports of higher wages and shortages of skilled workers. Price pressures   were mixed, moderating in retail and services, but ramping up in manufacturing.   Mild temperatures and ample rainfall helped small grains, but limited fieldwork   opportunities for District farmers.
Commercial real estate agents across the District reported that leasing activity   remained healthy in recent weeks. In the Raleigh market, a contact said industrial   activity was "on fire," driven by strong population growth in the area. Contacts   generally reported that vacancy rates edged down since our last report and several   noted a slight uptick in rental rates.
