Despite continuing softness in automobile and housing-related sales, most   Districts reported that consumer spending increased during October and early   November, and the retail sales outlook for the holiday season was cautiously   optimistic. According to most reports, growth in other service-producing industries   remained generally solid. Manufacturing activity was positive overall, with   the weakest reports concentrated among auto and housing-related producers. Reports   on housing markets continued to indicate an overall decline in single-family   home sales, and there were some reports of lower home prices. Indicators of   single-family construction continued to weaken in most Districts. However, housing   demand continued to be strong in a few specific markets, and nonresidential   activity generally improved. Many Districts noted a continued slowing in mortgage   lending, while reports on other lending were mixed. Some Districts reported   a slight increase in delinquencies.
A number of Districts continued to report that labor markets were tight, especially   for high-skilled occupations. Wage growth remained generally moderate, although   some Districts gave accounts of stronger wage pressures for some specialized   professions. Most Districts reported that prices moderated for construction   materials and energy products.
Most Districts reported continued softness in vehicle sales, led by weaker   sales for the Big Three U.S. auto makers. Slow or declining sales were noted   by Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, and high   vehicle inventories were reported by several Districts. The only account of   improved vehicle sales came from St. Louis, while Chicago described auto sales   as steady.
The Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, New York, and Richmond Districts indicated   that temporary staffing firms experienced solid demand for their services, although   Chicago and Dallas noted that the demand for temporary workers had softened.   The Atlanta and Cleveland Districts reported disappointing demand for freight   services. Atlanta noted that much of the weakness was concentrated in businesses   specialized in moving building materials, while Cleveland reported softness   for shipments of auto-related products. St. Louis noted that the local freight   transportation sector was expanding. Dallas observed that transportation demand   was good, although contacts are anticipating slower growth in coming months.
Reports from the tourism industry were generally positive. Atlanta said that   the Mississippi Gulf Coast gaming revenues returned to near pre-Katrina levels   in October on the strength of re-opened casinos. Kansas City noted continued   high hotel occupancy and solid airport traffic. Boston reported that tourism   was currently "going gangbusters" and that business travel was strong.   Richmond and New York also observed that tourism was stronger than in the last   report.
According to most reports, nonresidential markets improved since the last   report. Strengthening demand for office space was seen in the Boston, Dallas,   Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York, and Philadelphia regions. However, some   slowing was noted in the Chicago District. Atlanta noted that the overall level   of nonresidential construction remained modest. In the San Francisco District,   commercial and public project activity continued to expand, although the pace   of growth was slower than earlier in the year.
Wage growth remained generally moderate, but Boston, New York, and San Francisco   reported faster wage growth for some specialized professions. San Francisco   noted continued rapid wage growth for health care, finance, and construction   workers. According to Boston, pay levels for professional and technical jobs   were being boosted in order to recruit new workers and reduce staff turnover.   Employers in the Philadelphia District indicated that wages have been rising   more rapidly in the past few months than earlier in the year, whereas the pace   of wage increases was steady according to Chicago.
Most Districts reported that prices moderated for construction materials and   energy products. Kansas City noted that prices for some building products have   moderated because of the combination of lower demand and reduced transportation   costs. However, Minneapolis reported further price increases for roofing shingles   and foam rubber, and Cleveland noted that prices for petroleum-related products   remained high. Atlanta and Chicago observed that lower energy prices had led   to a decline in some fuel surcharges. According to Philadelphia, price increases   were not as widespread as they were earlier in the fall. Richmond said that   prices for manufacturing inputs and finished goods rose since the last report,   and Chicago noted that toolmakers and food processors reported raising prices.
Activity in the energy and mining sectors was generally robust in late October   through mid-November. Dallas, San Francisco, and Minneapolis reported that energy   extraction activity was strong, while Kansas City noted that activity declined   moderately but remained high by historical standards. Atlanta said that much   of the post-hurricane infrastructure repair work had been completed in the Gulf   of Mexico, and Dallas noted that the Gulf Coast refineries are now operating   at high levels.
