Business contacts in the First District are fairly upbeat, with the exception   of most retail respondents. Revenues in the fall months were generally ahead   of year-earlier levels, with double-digit increases for software and information   technology services firms and also for staffing firms. Commercial real estate   markets continue to strengthen. By contrast, while tourism-related businesses   are doing well, most contacted retailers say sales have softened; in addition,   manufacturers report that orders or sales of products related to housing have   weakened. All respondents say the high end of the labor market continues to   tighten. Pricing is mixed, as energy-related cost pressures have eased but selected   other input and vendor prices are rising.
Inventory levels are mixed, but most changes are in line with plans. Some   retail contacts report cost increases for energy related products, including   rubber and plastics; increases are also reported for steel and selected food   products. However, the price of flat-panel televisions is rapidly declining.   Several contacts report passing along small price increases to their consumers.   Employment has been mostly steady, with some hiring occurring for new store   openings. Many respondents are scaling back capital spending plans in response   to slower sales growth.
A tourism contact reports that "it's been a really good fall," with all New   England areas enjoying a good fall foliage period. Tourism is currently "going   gangbusters" in the Boston area, but starting to slow elsewhere. Business travel   is strong and the convention centers are doing well. Advanced bookings are still   low, with a lot of people purchasing at the last minute on the Internet. Foreign   tourism remains strong. While capital spending on tourist-related facilities   is occurring in the Boston area, including a surge in new spas, there is reportedly   little development elsewhere.
Many retail contacts remain concerned about the downturn in the housing market.   Overall, most are cautious in their outlook. Tourism is expected to remain strong   in the winter months.
Manufacturers note that rising costs for metals and paper are continuing to   exert pressure on margins. Heavy buyers of these inputs have raised their selling   prices in 2006 and generally expect to increase prices further later this year   or in early 2007. Respondents indicate that their costs for fuel and most other   oil-related inputs have stabilized, although they express some concern about   their high levels. Several firms mention that their business customers' finances   have improved, causing them to be more willing to pay higher prices. Otherwise,   input prices and selling prices mostly are either flat or declining in line   with their recent trends.
Regardless of whether their domestic headcounts increased, decreased, or remained   unchanged over the past year, most manufacturers anticipate that their U.S.   employment levels will hold steady or drift down in coming months. Base pay   increases mostly are expected to remain in the range of 3 percent to 4 percent   in 2007. Production workers are tending to receive lower raises, while experienced   technical and accounting workers are receiving larger increases. Some contacts   indicate that they need to boost pay of professional and technical workers considerably   in the Boston and New York City areas in order to recruit or to stem turnover.   Contacts remain concerned about escalating health care costs.
Several companies report that they plan to expand domestic capacity in either   2007 or 2008. Apart from these projects and some anticipated acquisitions, manufacturers'   U.S. capital spending plans appear to be modest.
The majority of manufacturing respondents expect business to be "pretty good"   in 2007, boosted in part by the introduction of new products. The remaining   contacts express some uncertainty or have diminished expectations concerning   revenue growth, especially during the first half of the year.
Approximately half of the contacted IT companies are adding technology workers   and sales staff, with companies serving the healthcare sector reporting that   they are hiring aggressively in order to keep pace with demand. Two firms are   downsizing their U.S. labor force; one plans to tighten slightly to be consistent   with their run rate, while another is looking to shift headcount to India. Those   with plans to hire report a tightening in the New England labor market, especially   for specialized technical positions. Respondents cite annual wage increases   for most employees between 4 percent and 8 percent.
Software and IT services contacts indicate that capital and technology spending   is at "normal" levels. Several report that financing has become easier. New   England software and IT firms are generally positive in their outlook, anticipating   steady or accelerating growth.
With the supply of engineers, nurses, IT specialists, and other skilled professionals   remaining tight, both bill rates and pay rates continue to increase. Respondents   are uncertain regarding the degree to which new health insurance legislation   in Massachusetts and Vermont will affect them, but most are concerned that it   will drive up costs. One contact is worried about a possible increase in the   minimum wage in Massachusetts. Despite these concerns, contacts are optimistic   about 2007, expecting business to continue to expand as long as the economy   is strong.
Contacts report improved leasing fundamentals in regional office space markets,   reflecting job growth. Higher rents and lower vacancies in downtown markets   have led some expanding tenants to move to suburban areas. As a result, suburban   markets are beginning to see increased rents and decreased vacancies.
There remains a remarkable amount of real estate investment in New England,   with contacts continuing to express surprise at the assumptions supporting aggressive   pricing. Though real estate yields are low overall, there is some evidence that   they are increasing slightly as improving market fundamentals have increased   real estate income.
Overall, contacts expect slight decreases in vacancies and slight increases   in rental rates going into the New Year. In addition, real estate investment   is expected to continue to be strong.
