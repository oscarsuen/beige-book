Reports from all twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity   continued to expand from mid-April to early June, but there were some signs   of deceleration. Activity moderated in four Districts--Atlanta, Kansas City,   Richmond, and San Francisco--and the New York District noted increased concern   about the outlook for the second half. Seven Districts--Boston, Chicago, Cleveland,   Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, and St. Louis--said growth was similar to the   pace reported in the last Beige Book. The Philadelphia District, however, reported   an improvement in overall economic conditions.
Consumer spending continued to increase, but District reports suggest that   the growth rate slowed. Manufacturing activity still expanded quite strongly,   but reports indicate more areas of weakness than in March and early April. Residential   real estate markets continued to cool across the country, with slower homebuilding   and sales of existing homes. In contrast, commercial real estate activity strengthened,   and a few reports expressed concern about too much building in some portions   of the real estate market. Activity in service-producing industries was strong   or increased in all Districts that reported on that sector. The financial sector   continues to report good credit quality. Commercial lending picked up, but there   was some slowing in loans to consumers, particularly for mortgages and home   equity loans. Growth in the energy industry continued to be robust, with expansion   constrained by shortages of equipment and labor. Agricultural conditions varied   across the country.
Labor markets continued to tighten, with more Districts reporting employers   having difficulty finding skilled workers. Wage pressures remained moderate   overall, with the exception being workers with hotly demanded skills. High energy   costs were fueling price increases in manufacturing and, to a much lesser extent,   retail. Reports of costs being passed forward varied considerably but were more   prevalent than in the last Beige Book.
Two Districts reported weaker retail sales growth--Dallas and Richmond--and   retail sales were "down" compared with last year in the St. Louis District.   The Boston and New York Districts said results were "mixed," but Boston added   that the majority of retailers cited soft year-over-year sales gains. Three   Districts--Kansas City, Minneapolis and San Francisco--reported little change   in retail sales. Philadelphia said sales in its District increased from April   to May, but gains were "varied" among stores. The Atlanta District reported   that sales rose at a "solid pace" but "some segments reported lower demand."   Improving trends were reported by the Cleveland District, and the Chicago District   said consumer spending continued to "increase modestly."
Most reports about auto sales suggested weakness, with particularly poor sales   of SUVs and light trucks. Auto sales were reported as "sluggish" or "down" in   the Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, and Philadelphia Districts. Atlanta reported   that sales were "mixed," and Kansas City said auto sales were unchanged from   last month but lower than a year ago. Sales increased in the Dallas and San   Francisco Districts, but some dealers in the Dallas District reported sizable   excess inventory because sales were less than expected over the winter months.   The Chicago and St. Louis Districts also reported that inventories were higher   than desired, and the Philadelphia District said dealers had limited their orders   to manufacturers to keep inventories in check. The Kansas City District reported   that inventory levels were satisfactory.
Manufacturing activity was characterized as "strong" or "up solidly" in the   Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and Kansas City Districts. The San Francisco District   reported that activity expanded overall, with production of commercial aircraft   near full capacity and capacity utilization of semiconductor manufacturers at   or above 90 percent. Production was "steady to increasing" in the Cleveland   District, and firms continued to report generally favorable conditions in the   New York District. Activity continued to expand in the Minneapolis and St. Louis   Districts. Two Districts--Philadelphia and Richmond--noted some softening or   leveling of growth. The Atlanta District said activity remained mixed.
Demand for trucking, shipping, and rail services remained strong across the   country, but companies cited difficulty finding and retaining drivers in the   Atlanta and Cleveland Districts. The Boston, Chicago, and Dallas Districts indicated   strong demand for air travel.
Reports from the tourism and hospitality industries remained upbeat. Tourism   activity strengthened in the Boston, Minneapolis, New York, and Richmond Districts   and remained solid in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.   The Chicago District reported steady tourist activity but noted that pre-bookings   were slow. Hotel occupancies were strong in parts of the Atlanta, New York,   Richmond, and San Francisco Districts, and the Atlanta District reported that   gambling revenues were recovering.
Some softening of the market for existing homes was reported by ten Districts--Chicago,   Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, New York, Richmond,   St. Louis, and San Francisco. Dallas and Richmond noted that activity remained   quite strong, and Chicago reported slowing from high levels. San Francisco reports   hot housing markets in Utah and parts of the Pacific Northwest. Several Districts   said sales had weakened for some of the most expensive homes, except in the   Dallas District where demand for lower-priced homes "had dipped noticeably."   Atlanta reported that residential sales were near year-ago levels in most parts   of the District, but that sales weakened and inventories increased in Florida.   The Philadelphia District said sales of homes in resort areas have declined   sharply. The New York District reports a sharp deceleration in prices in the   suburbs around New York City, but a tightening of the Manhattan rental markets.
Homebuilding slowed in most Districts--Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas   City, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and San Francisco. The New York District   reported that some homebuilders in New Jersey are withdrawing from the authorization   process and allowing their options to build to expire, noting that increases   in fuel and materials costs are pinching profits. Homebuilders in the Atlanta   District reported that single-family home construction was near year-ago levels   in most parts of the District, except in Florida, where sales slowed. The Atlanta   District also reported that Florida condominium sales continued to weaken and   several projects were cancelled.
Commercial real estate activity strengthened in nearly all Districts, with   mostly positive reports about office markets. Commercial building "improved"   in the Cleveland District. Office markets were steady or stronger in the New   York City metro area, with scattered signs of accelerating rents. The Philadelphia   District said vacancy rates have continued to decline in the region's office   markets. The Richmond District reported "fairly strong" office markets. Demand   for office space "edged up at a steady pace" in the Dallas District. Office   vacancy rates fell and rental rates rose in most major markets in the San Francisco   District.
Boston reported that downtown office real estate markets were improving but   mostly at the expense of suburban markets. Demand for commercial real estate   in the Chicago District continued to expand, but the pace of new commercial   construction slowed, according to contacts, who said rents were too low to justify   new construction.
The Kansas City District reported that commercial construction remained strong,   but received a few reports that high material costs were resulting in the scaling   down or postponement of some projects. Construction firms in the Philadelphia   District reported that rising costs have caused some construction projects to   be rebid or redesigned to reduce the amount of costly materials used. Some builders   in the San Francisco District continued to face cost increases and minor project   delays as a result of tight availability of skilled workers and selected materials,   such as steel and cement.
The Philadelphia District reported growing demand for industrial space and   an increase in construction of industrial buildings both on a speculative and   build-to-suit basis. Demand for industrial properties was said to be gradually   improving in the Dallas District. The Richmond District also reported growth   in commercial leasing in the industrial sector.
Contacts in the Boston, Chicago, and Dallas Districts expressed concern about   the level of investment in some portions of the real estate market. The Boston   District reported that New England--and Boston in particular--continues to attract   large volumes of commercial real estate investment, resulting in price increases   that require "ambitious assumptions" to justify the transaction. The Dallas   District noted growing concern about overbuilding of condominiums and town homes   in Dallas, and contacts "fear that it will end badly." A contact in the Chicago   District expressed concern about the potential for overbuilding of large distribution   centers in Indiana.
Demand for commercial loans increased or remained steady in most Districts,   with only the Atlanta and Chicago Districts reporting a slowing in commercial   lending activity. Bankers in the Dallas, and Richmond Districts said loan pricing   was very competitive, and contacts in the Richmond District said they had to   reduce margins to retain market share. On the consumer side, most Districts   reported softening mortgage finance activity, while reports of other types of   consumer loans were mixed. Demand for home equity loans weakened in the Chicago   and Kansas City Districts but was up in the Cleveland and Philadelphia Districts.   Refinance activity was categorized as "brisk" in the San Francisco District   but declined in the Chicago, Kansas City, and New York Districts. Slower auto   lending was reported by the Atlanta and Cleveland Districts.
Deposit growth was mostly steady, and some Districts noted an increase in   interest rates on deposits. Delinquencies declined in the Chicago and New York   Districts, but bankers in the Philadelphia District expect rising default rates   if interest rates continue to rise. The Kansas City and St. Louis Districts   reported no change in lending standards, while the New York District reported   an easing in credit standards, especially for consumer loans.
The energy industry continued to show strong and expanding oil and gas activity   in the five Districts that mention the sector--Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City,   Minneapolis, and San Francisco. The Dallas and Kansas City Districts noted that   drilling activity is being constrained by shortages of equipment and labor.   Expansion of coal-fired power plants, wind farms, and ethanol distilleries was   reported as under way in the Minneapolis District. The Kansas City District   also reported that a railway expansion is in progress that will allow more coal   to be moved out of Wyoming's Powder River Basin to end users.
The Kansas City and Minneapolis Districts reported that overall mining activity   is strong, with all open mines in the Minneapolis District producing at or near   capacity.
Salaries continued to rise, but wage pressures were reported to have intensified   somewhat in only a few Districts--Dallas, Kansas City, and Philadelphia. The   San Francisco District said wage growth remained rapid for selected worker groups   with specialized skills. The Cleveland District reported an absence of any accumulating   wage pressure outside of a few specific skills. Pay rates were not accelerating   in the Boston or Chicago Districts.
The Atlanta District reported that shortages of affordable housing were hampering   labor availability in South Florida and the Gulf Coast region.
Cost pressures increased in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas,   Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco Districts. Some firms   in the Philadelphia District said their suppliers were including automatic price   escalation in contracts to cover future increases in the cost of materials.   The San Francisco District noted little or no change from the modest upward   pressure on prices noted in the previous report. Only the Richmond District   reported that raw materials prices increased less rapidly than in the last report.
Higher prices were reported for a number of items, with the products most   cited including fuels, metals, petroleum-based products, and many building materials,   such as concrete, steel, copper, and zinc. The most notable price decline was   for natural gas. A number of Districts reported increases in fuel surcharges.   In the New York District, fuel surcharges were being added with relatively little   resistance from customers. Increases in delivery charges were noted by firms   in all industries in the Philadelphia District. The Cleveland District reports   that rising freight costs were affecting retailers.
Retailers in the Philadelphia District said they have raised retail prices   significantly for some goods with large plastic or metal content, although they   had not implemented major price increases for most lines of merchandise. Several   retailers in the Dallas District said that they had passed cost increases through   to higher selling prices. Retailers in the Boston District indicated that vendor   prices continued to reflect increases for petroleum-related items, and many   contacts reported being able to pass on some price increases to consumers. The   Atlanta District reported that firms' ability to pass on higher costs to customers   remained mixed, citing slowing demand and strong competition restraining price   increases. Five Districts--Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, New York, and San   Francisco--reported little change in retail prices since the previous reporting   period. The Richmond District reported that retail price growth eased slightly   in May.
