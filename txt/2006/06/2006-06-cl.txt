The District's economy continued expanding in late April and May, as it has   throughout the year. Most manufacturers reported steady to increasing production   in recent weeks. Retailers also reported better-than-anticipated increases in   sales relative to this time a year ago. Demand for trucking and shipping services   remained strong and broad-based. While commercial building continues to recover,   homebuilding has slowed. Some of this slowdown is reflected in weaker consumer   loan demand at District banks, though commercial borrowing continues to be steady.
On hiring, more firms reported that they are looking to add workers, and contacts   from the staffing-services industry said that some types of skilled workers   remain in short supply. Nevertheless, outside of a few areas, there were no   reports of any accumulating wage pressure. Nonlabor input-cost increases, however,   were widely reported. Specifically, contacts cited increases in the prices for   petroleum-based products, some building materials and metals, and natural gas.   Attempts to recover these increases in costs varied by industry; in general,   about half of the contacts from construction and manufacturing firms reported   attempts to increase prices in response to cost changes, while reports of retailers'   increasing their prices were few.
Production at the District's nondurable producers improved in April and May   but remains roughly the same as at this time last year. Several contacts reported   an increase in new orders. Hiring and planned increases in capital spending   were limited. Though nondurable good producers also reported price increases   in energy-related items, most contacts reported that their overall input costs   were stable. According to contacts, firms that attempted to increase their prices   had more success passing price increases along to smaller customers than to   larger customers.
Some segments, however, did see a softening. Reports from the District's discounters   indicated that their sales were slightly weaker than anticipated, though sales   still grew relative to a year ago. Some of this weakness was attributed to increases   in gasoline prices. Several contacts suggested that consumers were more value   conscious than in the recent past and that consumers may have been trying to   limit spending to necessities. Increases in gasoline prices also affected retailers   through rising freight costs; nevertheless, retailers' prices remained relatively   flat.
Most auto dealerships reported sluggish sales in late April and early May,   though sales of foreign nameplates fared significantly better than their domestic   counterparts. In response, some manufacturers are attempting to spur sales with   incentives. For instance, in early June, Ford announced a new incentive offer,   wherein buyers would receive $1,000 for gasoline purchases.
Almost all commercial contractors reported that business has tended to improve   throughout 2006 and is better than at this time in 2005. Contractors are optimistic   about the remainder of 2006. Building segments reportedly doing well include   office construction, particularly for professional service and health care concerns,   and public projects. Contacts reported rising materials costs, notably for copper,   concrete, drywall, and petroleum-related products. As a result, almost all contractors   are planning to increase prices sometime in the future. About half reported   increasing staff sizes, some significantly. Subcontractors are also seeing an   increase in work and are charging higher rates.
