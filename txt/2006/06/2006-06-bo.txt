The First District economy continues to expand. Manufacturers and software   and information technology services firms indicate that revenues are up solidly   from a year ago, with many manufacturers reporting double-digit gains. Companies   in the staffing industry also report steady revenue growth. Retailers' results,   by contrast, are mixed, with the majority citing softer year-over-year sales   gains. Respondents say the downtown office real estate picture is improving,   but mostly at the expense of suburban markets. Labor markets continue to tighten   in New England, with various professional and technical positions reportedly   difficult to fill; pay rates, however, are not said to be accelerating. Many   business contacts continue to express concern about high or rising input costs,   but report mixed success in raising their own prices.
Inventory levels are also mixed, with some retailers reporting more inventory   than desired, while others cite a need to boost inventories. Vendor prices continue   to reflect increases for petroleum-related items, while many contacts report   being able to pass on some price increases to consumers. Employment is varied,   with one contact eliminating several positions because of weaker than expected   sales, and several others increasing headcount due to acquisitions and seasonal   hiring. Most contacts say they are in line with capital spending plans for the   year, with spending primarily focused on new stores.
A travel and tourism contact reports that business is so robust in Boston,   the area is on pace to exceed the benchmark high levels established in 1999-2000   in every metric except average room rates. Business travel remains strong, but   is still cost sensitive. Advanced bookings are also solid. International travel   seems to be thriving, and the opening of several new major hotels is expected   to further spur demand. Rising gas prices and inflation remain a concern.
About one-half of the respondents express concern about high or rising transportation   and input costs, especially brass, bronze, titanium, and oil derivatives. Some   manufacturers have seen input costs decrease as a result of downward trends   for technology products or greater foreign sourcing. About one-half of the contacted   manufacturers have raised their selling prices in recent months or plan to do   so shortly. On the whole, they report that commercial and industrial customers   have been more accepting of price increases than retail purchasers.
Most manufacturers report little change in their U.S. headcounts, apart from   selective additions in professional, technical, and sales positions. Financial   and supply-chain management positions are said to be hard to fill. A couple   of firms are increasing production worker hours in the U.S., but others continue   to shift employment (both production and non-production) to lower-cost locations.   Average pay increases for 2006 are mostly in the range of 3 to 4 percent.
Domestic capital spending plans are quite varied, ranging from no change or   "tight" to substantial increases relative to last year. Some manufacturers are   investing to expand their product development or production, while others are   implementing IT system upgrades or installing more modern equipment.
Most manufacturers are upbeat about the demand for their products and services   through the remainder of 2006. To the extent they see risks, their concerns   chiefly center around the outlook for consumer spending and housing markets,   although some mention possible adverse effects on their own margins or the economy   at large from high or rising commodity prices.
The consensus among contacts is that demand for labor is solid but jobs are   becoming harder to fill. Labor supply continues to be tight, particularly for   high-end clerical and administrative positions, skilled manufacturing jobs,   and medical positions. More than one contact reports that even as the availability   of skilled labor is diminishing, clients are taking their time with the hiring   process or "setting the bar too high," and often losing qualified candidates   to other companies. Some respondents also indicate that clients are unwilling   to pay higher bill rates despite increasing recruiting costs and upward pressure   on pay rates for skilled workers. All contacts note an increase in demand for   permanent labor and a shift in the role of staffing companies away from the   "temp" side to more comprehensive staffing services, including human resources   and project management services. Contacts expect more of the same for the remainder   of the year--steady demand for staffing services coupled with a continued tightening   in the supply of skilled labor, resulting in increasing pay rates and bill rates.
Most software and IT services firms are increasing their headcounts between   5 percent and 10 percent. All firms with plans to hire report a tightening in   the labor market in New England, especially for technical positions. Several   firms note increased turnover and upward pressure on wages as employees now   have more job opportunities. Respondents report annual wage increases between   3 percent and 10 percent. Most software and IT services contacts indicate they   are holding capital spending fairly level; however, a few have increased outlays   to expand facilities and upgrade equipment.
First District software and information technology firms expect either steady   or accelerated growth for their companies in the third quarter. Two companies   say the biggest challenge to growth is finding people to fill open positions   at reasonable cost.
New England--and Boston in particular--continues to attract large volumes of   commercial real estate investment; contacts characterize the level of interest   as being "off the charts" or "incredible." They note that the resulting price   increases continue to compress commercial real estate yields. One contact worries   openly that commercial real estate properties are being "priced to perfection"   and may not be able to perform to the ambitious assumptions implicit in their   transaction prices.
