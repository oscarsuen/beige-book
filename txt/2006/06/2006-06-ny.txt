The Second District's economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace since   the last report. Businesses report increasingly widespread cost pressures, but   thus far there has been no broad-based acceleration in consumer prices. The   labor market has shown further signs of strength since the last report, except   in the construction industry, where some slackening is reported. On balance,   retailers report that sales remained close to plan since the last report, while   tourism activity has strengthened. Firms involved in goods production and distribution   report increasingly favorable business conditions in May. More generally, however,   business and household surveys suggest increased concern about the outlook for   the second half of the year. Housing markets showed further signs of softening   in April and May, though Manhattan's rental market is reported to have tightened.   However, office markets across the New York City metro area were steady to stronger   in April and May, with scattered signs of acceleration in rents. Finally, bankers   report across-the-board weakening in loan demand, particularly for consumer   loans, as well as easing in credit standards and lower delinquency rates.
Tourism activity in New York City has picked up since the last report: Manhattan   hotels report strong business in April, with occupancy rates rising by more   than the seasonal norm and room rates up nearly 11 percent from a year earlier.   Similarly, Broadway theaters report strong attendance for both April and May,   following a brief slump in March--attendance rose 4% from a year earlier, while   total revenues were up by well over 10 percent in both months.
Consumer confidence in the region, which reached a nearly 4-year high in March,   declined moderately in both April and May, based on the Conference Board's survey   of Middle Atlantic state (NY, NJ, Pa) residents. There was a pronounced drop   in consumers' expectations, but their assessment of current conditions remained   fairly positive.
The market for existing homes has also shown further signs of softening since   the last report, but observers differ on the nature and extent of a slowdown.   In New Jersey, the inventory of unsold homes continues to be much higher than   a year ago, with the increase reported to be concentrated at high end of the   market (over $500,000). The New York State Association of Realtors reports some   weakening in sales activity in March and April, and notes a sharp deceleration   in prices in the suburbs around New York City. A major Manhattan appraisal firm   reports a fairly large supply of apartments on the market and less of a spring   pickup in co-op and condo sales than usual this year. However, a major Manhattan   real estate firm notes that apartment prices have held steady and attributes   the growing inventory of homes on the market largely to a surge in newly constructed   units coming onto the market, rather than weakening demand. Manhattan's rental   market has reportedly strengthened since the last report, reflecting a lack   of new rental construction, a dwindling number of listings and continued strong   demand.
Office markets across the New York City area were steady to stronger since   the last report, with vacancy rates easing off and rents accelerating in some   areas. In April and May, office vacancy rates were little changed in northern   New Jersey, southwestern Connecticut and Westchester County, and down moderately   in Long Island and Midtown Manhattan. Lower Manhattan's vacancy rate rose, due   to an increase of 1.7 million square feet of available space with the opening   of 7 World Trade Center in May.
