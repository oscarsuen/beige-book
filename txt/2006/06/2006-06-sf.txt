District labor markets tightened a bit further during the survey period. Upward   wage pressures were moderate overall, but wage increases remained rapid for   workers with specialized skills in the construction, health-care, information   technology, and financial services sectors. More generally, contacts reported   healthy hiring activity, although the pace of hiring has slowed in parts of   California.
Most service providers saw robust demand. Activity was brisk in the health-care   services, professional services, and transportation sectors. Sales and hiring   activity grew further for providers of technology services, although the employment   outlook in this sector was clouded slightly by a report of reduced use of temporary   employees. District travel and tourist activity was vigorous. In Hawaii, substantial   increases in domestic tourist arrivals and spending offset recent declines in   Japanese tourist activity relative to year-earlier levels. For major District   tourist destinations in general, hotel occupancy rates remained high and room   rates rose further.
