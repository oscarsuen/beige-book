The Ninth District economy grew at a steady pace since the last report. Increases   in activity were noted in consumer spending, manufacturing, tourism, construction,   mining, energy, agriculture, and commercial real estate. Meanwhile, residential   real estate softened. Since the last report, the pace of employment and wage   growth increased slightly. Significant price increases were noted for fuel and   some construction materials.
Car dealers in south-central Montana noted that while consumers are more interested   in purchasing four-cylinder cars, sales of trucks and SUVs were still solid.   At a Minnesota dealership, May sales were strong, especially for fuel-efficient   vehicles.
Spring tourism activity posted modest increases, while tourism officials are   cautiously optimistic for the summer season despite higher gas prices. In Duluth,   Minn., recent tourism spending was up about 5 percent compared with a year ago,   and inquiries for summer activities were strong; business convention spending   was about even with a year ago. Tourism businesses in northwestern Minnesota   reported a positive outlook for summer activity. Tourism in Montana is expected   to grow 2 percent in 2006. According to a tourism official in the Black Hills   area of South Dakota, advanced summer bookings started slow but recently reached   normal trends.
Residential real estate continued to cool. New listings in Minneapolis-St.   Paul during the third week of May were up 18 percent over last year, while pending   sales were down 21 percent. Inventories in Sioux Falls were up 18 percent from   a year ago. In contrast, home sales remained strong in western Montana. The   commercial real estate market grew steadily. A bank director reported office,   retail, and industrial real estate in Sioux Falls as strong overall but down   from last year's record levels. In Minneapolis, commercial office absorption   continued to increase; for example, a large company is moving to a 188,000-square-foot   office tower downtown. A representative of a commercial real estate firm in   Minneapolis-St. Paul noted that businesses that require relatively high volumes   of office space were having difficulty finding openings.
A slight increase in the pace of wage raises was noted since the last report.   In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, wages for many trades, hospitals, and manufacturers   were up by about 3 percent to 4 percent. A bank director noted that the starting   wage for unskilled workers in Bozeman, Mont., is $6.50, well above the minimum   wage. Preliminary results of the professional services survey show an expected   average wage increase of about 3 percent during the next four quarters.
Significant price increases were noted in fuel, health insurance, and some   construction materials. Gasoline prices in Minnesota were up 79 cents at the   end of May compared with a year ago. Freight fuel surcharges have increased   to as high as 27 percent of total mileage, according to a Montana bank director.   A number of construction materials increased in price, including copper, insulation,   steel, and wallboard; in contrast, some lumber prices softened. Preliminary   results of the professional services survey reveal that 73 percent of respondents   expect overall inflation to increase during the next four quarters.
