Overall economic conditions in the Third District improved in May. Labor markets     tightened. Manufacturing increased during the month, although the pace of growth     eased. Retail sales of general merchandise rose, and the year-to-year gain improved     compared with April; however, auto sales declined. Bank lending has been increasing,     although demand for residential mortgages has softened. Residential real estate     activity slowed, but commercial real estate markets continued to firm.
Third District business contacts generally expect business activity in the   region to continue to expand at a moderate rate, but they anticipate further   slackening in auto sales and residential real estate. Manufacturers expect the   rate of growth to pick up during the second half of the year. Retailers anticipate   steady gains in the next few months, although for the longer term they are concerned   that if interest rates and gasoline prices remain at current levels or increase,   this will dampen consumer spending. Auto dealers expect sales to remain sluggish   through the rest of the year. Banks anticipate a moderate increase in business   and personal lending, but they forecast a further decline in mortgage lending   for home purchases. Contacts in residential real estate expect home sales and   construction to fall further this year. Contacts in commercial real estate foresee   an increase in demand for office and industrial space, but they expect construction   to ease.
Overall, manufacturers expect the pace of growth to improve in the months   ahead. Half the firms contacted in April expect their shipments and orders to   increase during the next six months; about one-fourth expect decreases. On balance,   capital spending plans among District manufacturers call for modest increases   in expenditures.
Auto sales in the region declined in May, compared with April and with May   of last year. Dealers said foreign models continue to have better year-to-year   sales comparisons than domestic models, and that luxury car sales have been   propped up by an increase in leasing. Inventories were held in check because   dealers have limited orders to manufacturers. The consensus among auto dealers   in the region is that sales will be sluggish for the rest of the year.
Residential real estate agents and homebuilders generally reported a slowing   in sales in May, compared with the pace set earlier this year and with sales   in May of last year. Real estate contacts noted that the number of existing   homes for sale and the time they are on the market have continued to increase.   Homebuilders and real estate agents expect sales this year to be lower than   in 2005, and they expect price appreciation to slow significantly. Although   home builders and real estate agents described the slowdown in sales as gradual   in most parts of the region, they indicated that sales of homes in resort areas   have declined sharply.
Employers in a range of industries reported that labor markets remain tight,   and college placement offices generally indicated that recruiting activity picked   up this year compared with last year. Most area firms indicated that wage and   salary increases implemented recently have been slightly greater than they were   last year. Employers reported having greater difficulty filling positions requiring   skilled labor and for some professional specialties, and they have raised salaries   more for these workers than for others. Employers also noted an increase in   quit rates as employees are finding higher-paid positions easier to obtain.   In some parts of the region seasonal jobs have been difficult to fill, and wages   for these jobs have increased significantly compared with a year ago.
