District economic activity grew more slowly in recent weeks, as a continued   decrease in housing activity was joined by some downshifting in the manufacturing   and retail sectors. District housing markets, while still relatively strong,   continued to soften as sales slowed in many areas; real estate agents anticipated   a further downward drift in prices. In May, factory output nearly flattened   following several months of growth, with new orders decelerating sharply as   well. Services firms and tourist establishments noted somewhat faster growth   in their revenues, but retailers reported weaker sales. Despite evidence of   softening economic activity, District labor markets remained strong outside   of decreased hiring by factories. On the price front, upward pressures pulled   back somewhat in May, though manufacturers told us that sharply higher input   prices squeezed margins and many would attempt to raise their prices going forward.   On District farms, generally dry weather assisted planting efforts but had little   negative impact on crops as yet.
Commercial real estate agents reported continued growth in leasing activity.   Gains were generally concentrated in the industrial sector, with office and   retail leasing also remaining fairly strong. Agents reported little change in   vacancy rates, which continued to be tight across the District. A retail contact   in Richmond, Va., reported that there had been "a lot of absorption due to a   lack of major projects." Agents also noted an increase in rent, especially for   office space.
