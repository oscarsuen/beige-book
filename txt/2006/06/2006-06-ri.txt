Commercial real estate agents reported continued growth in leasing activity. Gains were generally concentrated in the industrial sector, with office and retail leasing also remaining fairly strong. Agents reported little change in vacancy rates, which continued to be tight across the District. A retail contact in Richmond, Va., reported that there had been "a lot of absorption due to a lack of major projects." Agents also noted an increase in rent, especially for office space. Tourism Tourist activity strengthened since our last report. Contacts at hotels along the District's coast told us that bookings for the Memorial Day weekend--aided by near-perfect beach weather--were much stronger than a year ago. Tourism at mountain resorts in Virginia and West Virginia was also stronger. A manager at a mountain resort in Virginia said demand remains so strong, they are offering fewer discounts. In contrast, a hotelier at Virginia Beach indicated that she had to offer more discounts on selected rooms in order to fill their hotel. Temporary Employment Temporary employment firms in the District generally reported stronger demand for workers in April and May. An agent that serves Washington, D.C., and Maryland continued to report that they experience a "generally hot economy," making it more difficult to find qualified workers. Likewise, in Raleigh, N.C., an agent told us that a pick-up in the local economy had boosted the demand facing his firm, but a lack of qualified workers could hamper their ability to ramp up production. High-end administrative and specialty skills, clerical, and forklift skills were highly sought. Agriculture Dryer-than-normal weather widened the planting window for District crops in recent weeks. Cantaloupe, tomato, and watermelon plantings were well ahead of schedule in South Carolina, and great progress was made in planting peanuts and soybeans in Virginia. Despite the dry conditions in some areas of Virginia and the Carolinas, agricultural analysts characterized crop conditions as "fair to good" throughout the District. In addition, with drier conditions, livestock and pasture conditions deteriorated somewhat in South Carolina but were reported to be good in West Virginia.
