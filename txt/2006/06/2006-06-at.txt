Reports from Sixth District business contacts were mixed in April and May.   While most retail merchants indicated that sales rose at a solid pace and expressed   an upbeat near-term outlook, some segments reported lower demand. Auto sales   were varied, and dealers noted that sales of SUVs and large trucks were especially   soft. Residential construction remained steady with sales near year-ago levels   in most parts of the District. However, sales weakened in Florida, especially   in the condominium market. Nonresidential construction advanced at a modest   pace, and factory activity was mixed. Regional transportation companies continued   to report strong demand for their services, and Florida's tourism industry   posted good results in the spring. Bank loan demand continued to slow in parts   of the District. Employers in several industries noted difficulty in obtaining   skilled workers. Upward cost pressures were reported in many industries, whereas   the ability to pass on these higher costs to customers remained mixed.
Gradually declining vacancy rates and positive absorption indicated healthy   demand in nonresidential real estate markets across the District. However, construction   has only picked up modestly according to most contacts. The pace of nonresidential   redevelopment in hurricane-hit areas remains modest, although some parts of   the Mississippi coast were further along.
Strong demand for truck and rail services has continued to benefit most regional   transportation companies. Generally, pricing has remained firm, allowing most   trucking companies to recover part of the higher fuel costs. Driver shortages,   especially for long haul truckers, have continued to cloud the otherwise favorable   business outlook.
Mississippi's coastal casinos continued to rebound. Mississippi Gulf   Coast gaming revenues in April were back to approximately 60 percent of year-ago   levels. The largest impediment reported for the tourism industry there is the   scarcity of hotel rooms in the area.
Most reports note continuing upward price pressures, especially for building   materials and energy-related goods. Builders reported that prices for concrete,   steel, copper, and zinc continued to move higher. High crude oil prices have   pushed up the costs of petroleum-based goods such as PVC, roofing, and asphalt.   Several contacts in coastal areas noted higher insurance costs. Despite these   pressures, however, the ability to pass on higher costs to customers remained   mixed. Slowing demand and strong competition were the most often cited reasons   for not being able to raise prices.
