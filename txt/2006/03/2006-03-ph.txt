Third District business contacts generally expect business activity in the region to continue to expand at a modest rate.  Manufacturers expect growth in business to accelerate somewhat from the current pace, and they are scheduling a slight increase in capital outlays.  Retailers anticipate a small gain in sales in March and somewhat faster growth in April.  Auto dealers anticipate slower sales this year than in 2005.  Banks and other lenders expect business and personal lending to increase, but they forecast a decrease in residential mortgage lending.  Contacts in commercial real estate generally expect further declines in vacancy rates and a firming in rents.  Residential real estate agents and home builders anticipate slower sales for the balance of the year compared with the same period last year, and they expect the rate of home price appreciation to ease.
Overall, manufacturers expect growth in business activity to pick up in the months ahead.  Half of the firms contacted in February expect their shipments and orders to increase during the next six months; about one-tenth expect decreases.

Auto sales in the region rose slightly in February, although they were below the level of February 2005.  Area dealers gave mixed reports, indicating that foreign models continued to have better year-to-year sales comparisons than domestic models.  Dealers have kept inventories in check, limiting their orders to manufacturers.  On balance, area dealers expect sales this year to be below those of last year, but they are uncertain of the amount of the decline.
Residential real estate agents and homebuilders generally reported a slowing in sales in February, compared with the pace set earlier this winter and with sales in February of last year.  Some real estate contacts noted that the number of existing homes for sale has risen and the time they are on the market has increased.  Homebuilders and real estate agents expect sales this year to be lower than in 2005, and they expect price appreciation to slow significantly.
Employers in a range of industries reported that labor markets have tightened, noting that they have had more difficulty attracting and retaining qualified workers at all skill levels.  Employee turnover has increased, and several firms surveyed for this report indicated that they have stepped up counteroffers in order to keep employees from leaving.
