Economic activity continued to increase at a steady pace throughout the District in the first two months of 2006.  Moreover, gains were spread across a broad array of industries, including durable goods producers, most retailers, residential and non-residential builders, and trucking and shipping services providers.  However, nondurable goods production was little changed, and auto sales and production weakened.  While gains were widespread, cost pressures seemed somewhat less pronounced in recent weeks, especially among manufacturers.  Hiring continued to appear somewhat sluggish across the District, though contacts from staffing services firms noted that District openings were on the rise.  Moreover, many contacts mentioned that workers with adequate skills were becoming more difficult to find.
Among nondurable goods producers, production has been flat, both since the end of 2005 and relative to this time last year.  Contacts' current order books suggest that production will remain flat through the next few months.  Accordingly, capital expenditures are expected to remain flat or fall at most firms through the first half of this year.  In general, nondurable goods producers are not making net additions to their payrolls; however, in replacing staff, some contacts report difficulty finding workers with more specialized skills.  Among a majority of both nondurable and durable goods manufacturers, materials costs were characterized as flat overall through the end of February.
At District auto dealerships, sales generally remained somewhat sluggish, even though unseasonably warm weather had increased traffic at some showrooms.  Sales were especially weak for domestic nameplates.  As a consequence, inventories continued to be above desired levels, generally by more than thirty days.
Commercial contractors continued to report increases in activity.  In the first two months of 2006, activity was above that for the end of 2005 and a year ago.  While commercial builders' backlogs were mixed, many contacts reported thinking that recent inquiries were more likely to turn into jobs than in the past.  Regarding materials costs, commercials builders reported increases similar to those reported by residential builders, specifically citing increases in costs for concrete and some metals.  However, unlike homebuilders, most commercial contractors have been able to raise their prices, keeping profit margins stable.  Finally, most firms planned to add to their staffs in the months ahead.
