Most reports from Sixth District business contacts continued to be upbeat in late January and February.  Retailers posted strong results and auto sales improved.  Reports from the tourism sector continued to be positive.  Most industrial contacts reported an increase in activity, although weakness was cited for textiles and some auto producers.  Real estate contacts noted further slowing in several housing markets, while new nonresidential development remained modest.  Labor markets were described as firm in most areas, and shortages in several sectors were noted.  Energy-related costs remained elevated, and construction industry contacts noted concern about rising labor and material costs.  Non-energy consumer price increases remained moderate.
Auto sales improved slightly in late January and February.  Strong demand for imports and U.S.-assembled foreign models continued to offset disappointing sales of domestic-branded vehicles.  However, contacts noted that domestic vehicle sales received a boost from commercial fleet sales.  Import dealers reported healthy activity in February, although demand for trucks and some SUV segments remained sluggish.
According to most manufacturing contacts, near-term capital investment plans were modest.  Several noted that they had recently completed expansions or capital improvements.  The owner of a rock and gravel company, however, reported preparations for a large capital expansion, and a steel manufacturer reported capital spending plans related to efforts to improve productivity.
Freight demand remained strong in late January and February.  Contacts noted improved business conditions and tight capacity in rail and truck transportation.  Despite last year's storm-related disruptions and higher diesel costs, one major regional rail company reported improved revenues.
Most businesses continued to report that competitive pressures were limiting their ability to pass through input cost increases to customers.  In Florida, contacts noted that commercial construction costs were going up so much some projects were put on hold.  Louisiana and Mississippi officials are concerned about funding major rebuilding projects in light of rising labor and material costs.  Concrete, glass, and sheetrock price increases were reportedly driving up building costs.  Energy-related costs remained elevated and prices for products made with petroleum derivatives were expected to remain high.  Contacts feel that uncertainty and volatility in energy markets mean that energy-related surcharges are likely to stay in place into the indefinite future.
Shut-in oil and gas statistics improved marginally.  For crude oil, 25 percent of federal offshore Gulf of Mexico production remains shut-in, while 15 percent of natural gas is shut-in.  Lower demand, because of moderate winter temperatures, has offset production losses, keeping natural gas stocks significantly above their 5-year average.
