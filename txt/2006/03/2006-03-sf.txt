The Twelfth District's solid economic expansion remained on track during the survey period of mid-January through the beginning of March.  Contacts reported modest price and wage inflation on net, despite elevated prices for energy-intensive products and faster wage growth for scattered groups of workers with specialized skills.  Retail sales grew compared with year-earlier levels, and service providers saw robust demand.  District manufacturers reported generally solid demand.  Orders and sales grew for providers of agricultural and resource-related products.  Activity in residential real estate markets generally remained at high levels but slowed further in some areas, while demand for commercial real estate continued to improve.  District banks reported net growth in loan demand and very good credit quality.
The pace of wage growth was moderate on net, with increases generally in the range of 3 to 5 percent or less on an annual basis.  However, wage gains were rapid for scattered groups of workers with specialized skills in the financial, construction, health-care services, and information technology sectors; some of these worker groups have seen double-digit wage growth over the past year.
Service providers saw robust demand in general.  Orders and sales grew further in the food and beverage, health-care, and transportation sectors.  Intense competition held down sales for individual service providers in some sectors, such as media services and telecommunications, but past and ongoing investments in technologies that enhance efficiency helped these businesses maintain profit margins.  District travel and tourism activity was vigorous, notably in Hawaii, where visitor counts and spending remained on the record-setting pace established in 2005.  Tourist activity also was strong in California; hotel occupancy rates reportedly showed signs of stabilizing at high levels in the San Francisco Bay Area, but room rates rose further.
