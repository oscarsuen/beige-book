Economic activity in the Twelfth District expanded during late July and August at the solid but reduced pace established in the previous survey period.  Wage and price inflation were limited on net, with reports indicating substantial variation across sectors in the degree of wage and price pressures.  Reports on retail sales suggested modest growth overall, while demand for most services continued to expand at a brisk pace.  Demand and sales remained strong for manufacturers and producers of agricultural and resource-related products.  Residential construction activity, sales, and price appreciation continued to decelerate in most areas, while commercial real estate activity expanded further.  District banks reported solid loan demand on net, although residential mortgage lending slowed further.
Most service providers saw robust demand.  Activity rose further in the health-care, transportation, and professional services sectors.  Travel and tourist activity remained at very high levels in most major District markets; contacts provided no reports of adverse effects from heightened airport security arising from the recently uncovered terrorist plot in the United Kingdom, although it may be too early for these effects to appear.  In Hawaii, rising domestic tourist arrivals and spending continued to offset a decline in Japanese tourism and generate solid gains overall, although hotel occupancies were down a bit from year-earlier levels.
