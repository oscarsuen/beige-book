Demand for residential real estate fell further in most areas, while activity in commercial real estate markets continued to expand.  In most parts of the District, reduced home demand caused further increases in the inventory of available homes and continued declines in the pace of home sales and price appreciation.  The cooler sales conditions damped residential construction activity in most areas.  However, construction activity for commercial and public structures rose further.  In some areas, builders continued to face significant cost increases and project delays due to tight supplies of skilled workers and selected construction materials.  Vacancy rates on commercial space fell further in most parts of the District, and rental rates continued to rise. Financial Institutions District banking contacts reported solid loan demand and good credit quality overall.  Demand for commercial and industrial loans and for commercial real estate loans has been strong and grew further in some areas, while residential mortgage originations and refinancing activity continued to slow.  Contacts reported that indicators of credit quality, such as loan delinquencies, were at favorable levels in general.  Several banking contacts reported ongoing increases in capital spending on information technology equipment, partly as a means to offset growing labor shortages for some groups of workers.
