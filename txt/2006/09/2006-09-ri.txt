Economic activity in the Fifth District continued to grow at a slow pace since our last report, with the performance of individual sectors mixed.  Manufacturing activity posted modest growth, with new orders increasing somewhat and shipments declining slightly.  Retailers said that while overall sales remained sluggish, big-ticket sales weakened further.  Services firms generally reported moderately faster growth in revenues.  Housing markets cooled further in most, but not all, localities.  While current commercial real estate activity was spotty, there were hints of firming demand.  District labor markets remained solid, with businesses hiring and spot reports of skilled-worker shortages continuing.  Prices generally increased modestly, and contacts noted some pullbacks in energy and building materials prices.  In addition, businesses indicated that it was more difficult to pass higher input prices through to customers.  In agriculture, hot and dry conditions stressed crops and led to concerns about water supplies in some areas.
Commercial real estate agents across the District reported little overall change in leasing activity since our last report.  An agent in Manassas, Va., for example, noted that while office leasing had slowed significantly, retail and industrial leasing continued to be very strong due to rapid population growth of the area.  Agents noted that commercial rental rates appear to be firming.  A Raleigh, N.C., agent said that "it is still a tenant's market, but it is becoming increasingly better for the landlord."  Little change was reported in vacancy rates and new construction activity.
