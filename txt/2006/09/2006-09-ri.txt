Economic activity in the Fifth District continued to grow at a slow pace since our last report, with the performance of individual sectors mixed.  Manufacturing activity posted modest growth, with new orders increasing somewhat and shipments declining slightly.  Retailers said that while overall sales remained sluggish, big-ticket sales weakened further.  Services firms generally reported moderately faster growth in revenues.  Housing markets cooled further in most, but not all, localities.  While current commercial real estate activity was spotty, there were hints of firming demand.  District labor markets remained solid, with businesses hiring and spot reports of skilled-worker shortages continuing.  Prices generally increased modestly, and contacts noted some pullbacks in energy and building materials prices.  In addition, businesses indicated that it was more difficult to pass higher input prices through to customers.  In agriculture, hot and dry conditions stressed crops and led to concerns about water supplies in some areas.
District retailers reported generally sluggish retail sales, with continued weakness in big ticket sales offsetting steady activity in other categories.  On a positive note, a sales tax holiday boosted back-to-school sales in Virginia.  However, a big-box retail contact indicated that higher gasoline prices continued to cut into the budget of many of his customers, contributing to a small decline in same-store sales.  Sales were lower at a building supply chain as housing construction cooled.  Car and light truck sales were generally softer.  An automobile dealer in northeastern West Virginia said that buyers have become more cautious and that he had reduced his inventory in line with lower sales expectations.  Retail employment was unchanged among many of our contacts, although some department stores increased their ratio of regular part-time to full-time workers.  Retail price growth edged up slightly, though not in all categories.  A contact in the Washington, D.C., area said that a falloff in new residential construction lowered prices of lumber and plywood in recent weeks.
Revenue growth at service-producing firms generally picked up in recent weeks.  Despite recently heightened security concerns, airports reported that their revenues grew more quickly.  Air conditioning contractors also noted strong demand for their services as temperatures remained above normal.  Contacts at several District hospitals and healthcare systems reported solid consumer demand, but said they are bracing for an expected round of reimbursement cuts from Medicare.  In contrast, architects said their billings flattened as the market for new homes slowed.  The pace of hiring in the services sector stepped up, while services price growth moderated since our last report.
Commercial real estate agents across the District reported little overall change in leasing activity since our last report.  An agent in Manassas, Va., for example, noted that while office leasing had slowed significantly, retail and industrial leasing continued to be very strong due to rapid population growth of the area.  Agents noted that commercial rental rates appear to be firming.  A Raleigh, N.C., agent said that "it is still a tenant's market, but it is becoming increasingly better for the landlord."  Little change was reported in vacancy rates and new construction activity.
Temporary employment agents reported generally strong demand for workers since our last report.  In Richmond, Va., an agent was optimistic that demand would remain solid as companies were increasingly relying on temporary workers.  An agent in Raleigh, N.C., reported ongoing demand for full-time workers, but added that skilled workers remained hard to find.  In contrast, some softening in demand for temporary workers was reported by an agent in the Washington, D.C., area.  Employees with skills in computers, sales, production, warehouse, and life sciences were highly sought by employers.  Increasingly, employers also were looking for bilingual employees.
