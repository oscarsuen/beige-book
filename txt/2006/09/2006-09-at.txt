Reports from Sixth District contacts indicated that business activity was mixed from mid-July through August.  Retail sales exceeded expectations while auto sales were down overall from a year ago.  Home sales and new residential construction continued to weaken in many areas, with Florida markets reporting the largest declines.  In contrast, the pace of nonresidential construction improved slightly.  Also, reports from manufacturers, transportation firms, and tourist industry contacts were generally upbeat.  Banking contacts noted lower residential loan demand and little change in the demand for commercial and industrial loans.  Contacts reported that labor shortages in the construction industry persisted in many parts of the District, while localized shortages were noted in some other industries, including the Gulf Coast hospitality industry.  Continuing cost pressures related to energy inputs were reported by most businesses, whereas the ability to pass along these higher costs to consumers remained limited.
Vehicle sales continued to be mixed.  Domestic brand dealers reported sluggish traffic and undesirably high inventories.  Dealers handling foreign brands noted improved volumes from a year earlier, although some had offered incentives to clear inventories of less fuel-efficient 2006 models.
Reports from commercial builders indicated that nonresidential construction in the District was slightly stronger than a year earlier.  Modest improvements were noted in the industrial and office sectors as vacancy rates declined in several markets.  Contacts in Florida noted that condominium developers and contractors were now turning to the non-residential market for new business.  Most reports anticipated continued modest increases in activity over the next several months.
Most businesses reported continuing costs pressures because of high energy prices, with only limited success in passing higher costs on to consumers.  Many firms had adjusted to increased costs by cutting profit margins or reducing staff and service levels.  However, one steel manufacturer reported that further cost cuts were no longer possible without affecting efficiency and productivity.  Residential and commercial construction contacts noted increasing material and labor costs, especially along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
Interest in energy exploration in the Gulf of Mexico has intensified with the total value of bids for federal oil and gas leases in the Gulf up 38 percent from August of last year.
