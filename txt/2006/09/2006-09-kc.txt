The Tenth District economy expanded modestly in late July and early August, with the pace of growth easing somewhat from the previous survey period.  Labor markets continued to expand solidly, energy activity increased further, and commercial real estate activity improved.  However, growth in consumer spending and manufacturing activity slowed, and residential real estate activity declined.  Agricultural conditions generally remained unfavorable due to drought.  Wage pressures continued to build, but wholesale price pressures eased slightly and retail price pressures remained modest.
