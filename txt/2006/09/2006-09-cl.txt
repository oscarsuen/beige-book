The District's economy showed modest growth in July and early August, but growth was mixed and the outlook less certain due a continuing slowdown in auto production and residential construction.  Most District manufacturing contacts reported steady production in the six weeks ending in mid August, although their outlook has dimmed somewhat.  Retailers experienced mixed sales activity with high gasoline prices most often cited as the reason for any declines.  Commercial builders reported strong backlogs and an increase in customer inquiries, while new home sales continued to be weak.  Commercial and consumer borrowing was generally characterized as steady.  And the strong demand for trucking and shipping services seen for the past year has begun to moderate.
On net, hiring across the District was steady.  Staffing firms reported job openings in Ohio and Pennsylvania continued to moderately increase with demand coming from the professional business services, healthcare, and defense sectors.  Wage pressures were not seen as an issue at this time.  Although many contacts reported increased input costs related to petroleum, metals, and healthcare, several noted that the rate of increase seems to be slowing.  Most manufacturers attempted to pass these costs along to their customers with a mixed degree of success.  Retailers generally reported holding their prices steady.
Production at the District's nondurable goods facilities has been steady since mid July with mixed results on a year-over-year basis.  Expectations for the next six months are also mixed.  Most producers reported idle capacity and only a few planned to increase their investment spending.  None of the contacts reported increasing employment in the past six weeks and only two said they plan to hire in the near future.
Several contacts noted their costs are rising due primarily to energy prices and healthcare expenses, although several also said that the rate of increase in healthcare expenses has slowed; nevertheless, product prices were holding steady to showing only modest increases.  Most retailers noted no unusual hiring plans.
New car sales were mixed with foreign plates generally doing better than domestics.  On a year-over-year basis car sales are down significantly due to the success of last year's employee pricing program.  SUV sales also showed a dramatic decline with dealers blaming consistently high gas prices.
The District's commercial contractors all reported an increase in business on a year-over-year basis and that customer inquiries were up since mid-July.  The majority of builders also reported strong backlogs.  Among the segments where sales remained robust were health care and manufacturing.  Retail (specifically foreign-nameplate auto dealerships) and municipal utilities saw a pickup in construction activity.  Material costs reportedly continued to rise across the board.  Copper and petroleum-related products increased significantly while more modest increases were reported for steel and concrete.  Most builders can pass these price increases through to their new customers, but aren't able to adjust existing contracts.  Contractors reported little change in the size of their labor force.
