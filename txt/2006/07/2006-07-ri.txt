District economic activity generally grew more slowly since our last report, with only manufacturing output and temporary hiring showing much life in recent weeks.  Retail sales were flat over the period for the most part, with big-ticket sales softening and domestic automobile inventories increasing.  Revenues at services firms grew, but at a slower pace.  Factory output bounced up in early July after holding steady in June, and new orders firmed as well.  Residential real estate markets continued to cool and commercial activity took a breather.  District hiring was mixed, with the pace of activity softer in retail, unchanged at services firms and stronger in manufacturing.  Prices continued to be pressured by pass-throughs of higher raw materials prices, but there were hints that the pace could be lessening.  In agriculture, widespread rainfall in early July helped stressed crops and pastures.
Commercial real estate agents reported slowing leasing activity, although several noted increases in the office and industrial segments of the market.  A contact in Richmond, Va., said that high commercial rents in northern Virginia had caused a number of companies to relocate to the Richmond area, boosting demand there.  Little change was reported in overall vacancy and rental rates, however.  Commercial real estate agents reported a small increase in new construction.  An agent in Raleigh, N.C., noted that most construction coming to market is "already pre-leased and therefore will not affect vacancy rates."
