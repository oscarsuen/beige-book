Overall economic activity in the Third District increased in early July, although the rate of growth appeared to be easing.  The manufacturing sector improved but not as much as in June.  Retail sales of general merchandise rose, but auto sales were flat.  Bank lending increased, although demand for residential mortgages continued to fade.  Service industry activity rose, but the pace of growth has slowed somewhat from the first half of the year.
Third District business contacts generally expect business activity in the region to expand in the second half of the year, but not quite as strongly as in the first half.  Manufacturers expect further gains, but not a strong advance.  Retailers anticipate sales to continue growing near the current rate, but they say it is difficult to predict how successful the fall season will be.  Auto dealers expect sales to remain sluggish through the rest of the year despite the reintroduction of manufacturers' incentives.  Banks anticipate a moderate increase in overall lending, but they forecast a further decline in mortgage lending for home purchases.  Service-sector firms expect business to continue to rise in the second half of the year, but not as rapidly as in the first half.
Overall, manufacturers expect business conditions to improve in the second half of the year, but they do not anticipate a strong advance.  Somewhat fewer than half of the firms contacted in early July expect their shipments and orders to increase during the next six months; about one-fourth expect decreases.  On balance, capital spending plans among District manufacturers call for modest increases in expenditures.
Auto sales in the region were virtually steady in June and early July but below the level recorded in the same period a year ago.  Dealers said domestic manufacturers' incentives and discounts were propping up their sales, but foreign models continued to have better year-to-year sales comparisons than domestic models.  Inventories were above desired levels but appeared to be steady.  Despite support from manufacturers' incentives, dealers in the region expect sales to be sluggish for the rest of the year.
Bankers in the District expect continued growth in business and consumer lending in the months ahead, although they believe the rate of growth is slackening.  They also expect gains in credit card lending, but they expect little if any growth in other types of personal lending.  They expect residential mortgage demand to decline further.
Employers in a range of industries reported that labor markets remain tight.    Most of the firms contacted for this report indicated that wage and salary levels have been edging up.  Employers said they have been having difficulty filling certain professional and managerial positions, and they have raised salaries more for these positions than for others.
