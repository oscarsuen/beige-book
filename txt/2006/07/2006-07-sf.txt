The Twelfth District's solid economic expansion continued during the survey period of early June through mid-July, but reports indicated that the pace of growth moderated somewhat.  Wage and price inflation were limited on net, although wage growth remained rapid for selected worker groups with specialized skills.  Growth in retail sales was modest, falling below some retailers' expectations, while demand for services remained robust.  Manufacturers saw solid demand, as did producers of agricultural and resource-related products.  Residential construction activity, sales, and price appreciation continued to soften in most areas, while activity in commercial real estate markets picked up further.  District banks reported strong loan demand on net but slight slowing for some categories.
District labor markets tightened a bit further.  Wage increases were moderate overall, reportedly in the range of 3 to 4 percent on an annual basis, but they remained more rapid for workers with specialized skills in many sectors.  Contacts in various sectors reported that employers increasingly relied on hiring bonuses and incentive packages to attract and retain qualified workers.  Growth in employers' costs for employee benefits, particularly for health insurance, reportedly has subsided from the rapid pace reported in previous survey periods.
Most service providers continued to see robust demand.  Activity was brisk in the health-care services and professional services sectors.  Providers of telecommunications and transportation services saw strong demand.  Travel and tourist activity was robust in most major markets.  In Hawaii, further increases in domestic tourist arrivals and spending more than offset a continued decline in visits by Japanese tourists.  Hotel occupancy rates generally remained high and room rates rose further there and in other tourist destinations throughout the District.
