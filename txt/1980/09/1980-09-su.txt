Professors and Financial Panel. Professors Eckstein, Samuelson, and Tobin agree that monetary and fiscal policies now in place will generate a sluggish recovery. Eckstein, concerned about the snugness of monetary growth targets, says allowing another housing setback would be "pointless nonsense." Samuelson believes the Fed should make clear its willingness to violate the targets if they interfere with a satisfactory recovery. Tobin thinks an incomes policy is required in addition to monetary and fiscal policies to reduce inflation, and he considers targets for monetary aggregates to be ridiculous. New York now features the views of a Financial Panel as a regular part of its report, beginning this month with Henry Kaufman, James O'Leary, and Albert Wojnilower. Kaufman expects the economy to begin recovering next quarter, despite the backup in interest rates which, he says, is slowing the reliquefaction of businesses. O'Leary finds a universal expectation of no decline in the basic inflation rate-an expectation that he believes is not fully appreciated by the authorities. Wojnilower feels the recession is ending, and anticipates surprises on the high side in business conditions.
