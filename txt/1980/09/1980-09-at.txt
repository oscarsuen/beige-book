Guarded optimism characterizes most reports throughout the District. There is growing sentiment that the recession has bottomed out. While consumer spending continues to be restrained, confidence seems to be returning. Inventories are in line, with few exceptions. Laid-off workers are being recalled in some industries. Several large capital investment projects are recently under way. Alabama, with its large share of heavy industry, has been hardest hit—unemployment has reached nearly 11 percent. The unrelenting heat wave exacted a heavy toll from livestock and crop production.
New auto sales have improved in most areas, and used car activity has picked up in parts of the District. There is greater optimism among dealers than earlier in the summer. Consumers are exhibiting an acute awareness of prevailing rates for installment loans—they are shopping for the cheapest money. There is a lot of potential buyer interest in the new introductions by Ford and Chrysler due out this fall. Many new car dealers report lean inventories in preparation for the new model year.
Inventories have been closely monitored, and most contacts note no appreciable buildup. Merchants are buying closer to the time of a sale, as heavily promoted, sale-priced merchandise is turning over quickly.
While some commercial banks report soft consumer loan demand, the District's large banks posted good gains in real estate and installment loans. Continued funding for existing projects characterizes commercial lending activity. With the opening of the sixteenth foreign agency branch in Miami and more on the way, international banking is maintaining a rapid growth rate in south Florida.
Tourism has fared reasonably well this summer. The percentage of foreign visitors continues to increase. One central Florida tourist attraction reported that 27 percent of its current visitors are international. The boom in Latin American visitors to the Miami area shows no letup. While the domestic tourist market has been off significantly, the slack has been taken up by the international tourist. Southwest Florida, which is more heavily dependent on automobile arrivals, has been lagging behind last year. Visitors to Opryland in Nashville are down about 7 percent, mostly due to a decline in out-of-region travelers. The convention trade seems to be relatively recession proof. One contact noted that visitors are responding to the recession by reducing the length of their stay and spending less, but they have not stopped coming.
High-technology firms are not feeling the adverse effects of recession to the same extent as other industries. Scientific-Atlanta, for example, offers productivity-enhancing products, such as communication devices and, as a result, continues to receive orders when capital spending is down.
