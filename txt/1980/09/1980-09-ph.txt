Reports from the Third District indicate that business activity in the month of September is sluggish, but hold some hope for improvement. Manufacturers indicate a slight increase in overall industrial activity, the first in over a year, but are still playing a close hand, cutting inventories and payrolls, albeit marginally. Local manufacturers also report continued inflation with no foreseeable relief within the next six months. Retailers say September sales are about even with a year ago, but write off the slowness to a late summer heat wave. District bankers report C&I loan volume to be up from last September, but say consumer loans are slightly off.
As for the future, representatives of the industrial sector expect a major upswing within the next six months. Retailers are also planning for recovery, but remain more cautious than the manufacturers. Contacts in the financial sector are forecasting increased loan volume as the economy picks up, but disagree on exactly where interest rates are heading.
Looking ahead to the next six months, survey respondents are projecting a strong boost for industrial activity, marked by steep increases in new orders and shipments and swelling producers' backlogs. To meet the renewed demand, manufacturers plan to increase inventories, lengthen the workweek, and add new employees by next March. Increased expenditures on plant and equipment are also forecast, as the expected recovery gets underway.
On the inflation front, industrial prices are up again in September, as 55 percent of the survey respondents report paying more for raw materials than they did last month, and about one-quarter are charging higher prices for their finished products. For the longer term, over 90 percent anticipate higher input costs six months from now, and over 70 percent plan price hikes for their finished goods.
Local department store executives are projecting a marginal increase in sales as they head into the Christmas season, but continue to plan cautiously. No changes are planned for future inventories. This year's Christmas season is expected to be fair to good, but definitely "not a banner year."
Banks in the Third District are currently quoting prime rates of 11 1/2 and 12 percent. Projections of the prime rate are mixed as some contacts expect the forecasted first quarter recovery and concurrent "easy money" to drop the prime rate to between 10 and 11 percent. Others foresee a slight increase to 12 to 13 percent.
Deposits are generally up over last year's levels, although saving certificates are reported to be flat. All deposits are below budget, though.
