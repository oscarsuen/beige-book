In August, the District economy continued to show signs of improvement. Retail sales, home sales, and manufacturing activity all picked up, leading to increased lending at savings and loans. Reflecting these developments, fewer District workers were laid off and more were hired in August than in July. Auto sales, metal mining, and commercial bank lending remained fairly weak, however, and excess autos and iron ore were the District's two biggest inventory problems.
In contrast to retail and home sales, District auto sales have not yet begun to recover. New domestic car and truck sales declined between July and August.
