Economic activity has been "better than expected" recently in the district. Merchants are optimistic about Christmas sales, and industrial concerns are lengthening their workweeks and recalling workers as orders have picked up. Business men are concerned, however, that the rapidly escalating cost of money may forestall a strong recovery. Recent increased weakness in housing markets lends substance to their fears.
New car sales are holding up, particularly x-cars and k-cars, but there is dealer concern about rising interest rates. Good sales in northern Alabama were attributed to customers rushing to get the 1980 models still in stock. Relatively strong demand for mid-size and large used cars reflects buyer resistance to the prices of the 1981 models. Many buyers are paying cash and are more willing to draw down or borrow against savings rather than pay the high conventional finance.
In general, not much optimism can be found about the real estate and home construction industries. Nonresidential is doing well in comparison, with several large office building projects announced recently. New Orleans, in particular, is quite strong.
Recent statistics indicate that Florida attracted more investment in the first six months of 1980 than for all of 1979. Local option tax breaks are expected to benefit industry-hungry north Florida communities, which in the past have had little to offer to compete with tax incentives offered by bordering Alabama and Georgia. Alabama's liberal program offers property tax exemptions for as long as 40 years and easy-to-obtain revenue bond financing.
Georgia has topped the $1 billion mark in new and expanding manufacturing investment in 1980. Pratt and Whitney aircraft has recently announced plans to build a $100 million plant in Columbus, Georgia, to produce parts for its civilian and military engines. Plans call for a major expansion and upgrading of the state docks at the port of mobile, following a record year of tonnage handled.
Ground was recently broken for the only world's fair scheduled for the 1980s. It will be held in Knoxville, Tennessee, from May through October of 1982. The theme of the fair is "Energy turns the World." Financing for the World's fair will come from private sources.
