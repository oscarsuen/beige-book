The financial consultants continue to urge the Fed to persist in its determination to reduce the inflation rate. Mr. Kaufman expects a slowing in the pace of recovery in the early part of 1981. At about the same time, he anticipates a temporary decline in short-term interest rates along with a wave of new corporate bond offerings. Mr. O'Leary strongly urges the Fed to continue pursuing a policy designed to reduce the inflation rate and to defuse expectations of inflation. Mr. Stone feels that the Fed should soon achieve success in slowing the aggregates sufficiently to meet its longer term growth targets. He perceives a drop in short-term rates over the balance of the year, and while he does not foresee a double dip recession, a pause in the recovery within the next three months should be expected.
