Business activity in the Second District was mixed in October. Retail sales strengthened during the month, reflecting extensive promotional activity. Foreign car sales picked up, while the slump in domestic car sales deepened. No turnaround is expected on the domestic side until late spring. Outside the consumer sector, some signs of a weak pickup have been reported in chemicals, machine tools, and paper and packaging products. The respondents, for the most part, expect a slight upturn in the fourth quarter, but do not anticipate any major economic recovery until the second half of 1981. On the financial side, business loans at New York City banks have declined since mid-October. In the mortgage market, rates have stabilized recently after rising sharply in September and early October.
Automobile sales in the Second District were mixed in October, with foreign car sales outperforming domestic. Foreign car sales were reported to be about as strong as in the comparable month last year with prospects for further improvement in November. In contrast, domestic car sales are below the volume a year ago, and the slump is expected to continue at least until late spring. Rising auto prices combined with shrinking discretionary income were cited as making consumer spending cautious so that only lower priced, leftover-1980 models appear to be selling. Consequently, the domestic dealers contacted expect more dealerships to close. Wherever possible, inventories at the dealer level have been kept intentionally lean. Auto makers voiced concern that any further downturn in sales might place some capital spending plans in jeopardy.
Kaufman: While real GNP will probably increase at an annual rate of at least 3 percent in this quarter, a slowing in the pace of the recovery is likely in the 1st quarter of 1981, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and increases in the Social Security tax. In the credit market, another wave of new corporate bond offerings is likely to hit the market in the early part of next year when short-term interest rates are likely to decline for a short period of time.
Mr. O'Leary: We are in the midst of a broad revolutionary change in the long-term capital markets—a sharp reduction in the availability of funds for investment in straight, long-term fixed-rate bonds and mortgages. Since most investors are convinced that the upward trend of inflation and of interest rates will continue, there will continue to be a very high-risk premium in the yields on these instruments and the long-term, fixed-rate markets will continue to be subject to great volatility. The need for the Federal Reserve to persist in its determination to pursue a policy designed to reduce the inflation rate and to defuse the expectation of inflation isthus most urgent. It is imperative that the new Republican Administration aid the monetary authorities with real fiscal restraint and other long-term policies.
Mr. Stone: Member bank borrowings have now reached levels that should enable the Fed to achieve success in its effort to slow the aggregates sufficiently to meet its longer term growth target. Success could probably be assured by holding borrowings at or slightly above current levels for another three to four weeks. As markets begin to perceive such success, short rates will drop very rapidly—probably by 100 to 150 basis points, which I judge to be the amount of expectational fluff now in the market. Rates would then work lower over the balance of the year, closing well below present levels. I do not believe that the economy will experience a double dip. We are, however, likely to see a pause some time within the next months, and this will reinforce the decline in interest rates.
