There is little indication of any significant changes in the level of business activity in the Fifth District over the past month. In the manufacturing sector shipments and new orders increased, on balance, but only very slightly. Backlogs of orders and inventories declined somewhat. Among retailers there were some gains as total sales and relative sales of big tickets rose slightly. There is little evidence of any broad recovery in consumer durables, however. Employment around the District held steady on balance. Prices continue to rise across a broad front. The view that business activity generally will improve over the next six months gained adherents over the last month.
