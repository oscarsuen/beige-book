Fifth District business was characterized by change in November. In most sectors and in most areas that change was toward somewhat weaker performance. Some areas of strength seem to have emerged, however. Retail sales, in particular, picked up over the past month according to our survey. Sales of consumer durables have kept pace recently but have not reversed earlier declines. Manufacturers surveyed report declines in new orders, order backlogs, inventories, and employment over the latest survey period. Inventories, of other than automobiles, have not become a problem for most businesses. Housing sales and construction showed renewed weakness in recent weeks after having recovered somewhat in most areas. Price increases continue widespread. The outlook for business activity over the next six months remains generally positive.
