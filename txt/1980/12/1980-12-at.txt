Weakness in housing and auto sales has darkened an otherwise strengthening economic picture in the District. Retail sales were up in real terms, factory payrolls advanced notably, and nonfarm employment accelerated. Rapidly rising interest rates, however, have about shut down housing starts, and auto dealers express concern over slumping sales.
This year's Christmas buying season is a full week shorter than last year, although many merchants began Christmas advertising before Thanksgiving. The shortened period may hurt impulse buying. A southern Mississippi merchant notes selective buying of practical items. High- priced quality merchandise, such as televisions and stereos, is selling well. A major department store's strongest sales were in furs, jewelry, high-quality apparel, and items with a western touch. Specialty store proprietors report good sales of investment-priced items. People want something that will last. Retailers catering to the luxury market and discounters selling top-quality goods seem to be doing better than mass merchandisers and low-end discounters, whose customers are the hardest hit by inflation. Retailers report inventory stockpiles up as much as 10 percent over the same period last year in anticipation of a heavier-than-usual post-Thanksgiving Christmas crunch.
Auto dealers are encountering difficulties as high interest rates and buyer resistance to price increases draw down sales. One dealer reports that the only small cars available from the manufacturer are loaded with expensive options. Many prospective buyers are failing to qualify for loans under current interest rates. Dealers expect conditions to persist through December but are optimistic about 1981.
We have received mixed reports about the tourist industry at this time. The recession in other parts of the country is being reflected in central Florida as attendance at major attractions there was off 25 percent from last November. In south Florida, however, bookings at a luxury hotel are 30 percent ahead of last year, perhaps indicating the affluence of the international visitors in that area. October was characterized as the biggest month ever for tourists in New Orleans.
