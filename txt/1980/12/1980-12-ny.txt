Business activity in the Second District was mixed in November. Retail sales were generally flat on a constant-dollar basis during the month. Foreign car sales picked up, but domestic car sales continued to stagnate. Outside the consumer sector, signs of weakness were spreading among machine toolmakers and in the steel industry. The respondents, for the most part, do not anticipate any major economic recovery before mid-1981. On the financial side, the suspension of usury ceilings in New York State is expected to raise rates sharply on personal borrowing and weaken demand for such loans. Strong demand for business loans was reported. In the mortgage market, financing has generally been available, but the demand weak because of the high rates.
Automobile sales in the Second District followed the pattern of the last few months. Imports have shown consistent strength, while domestic car sales have been generally stagnant, as consumers continue to show resistance to the high prices for the newly introduced small cars. Used car sales are still sluggish. Reactions to the lifting of state usury ceilings varied. Although some negative impact on car sales is anticipated, most dealers feel that the high auto prices will be the primary factor limiting sales.
Riefler: The Fed's policy is beginning to work. Inflationary expectations as reflected in the commodity markets (and to some degree the stock market) are being adjusted downward. Before too long money supply numbers will also weaken. The long-term financial markets have shown remarkably good stability, given what has happened to short-term rates. It is important to remember two things: Markets do overshoot and interest rate levels are reversible. Because rates can come down, there is less reason to be fearful about the longer-term impact of today's interest rates on the economy. Prospects for autos and housing are not great, but otherwise spending should not fall precipitously in the months to come.
Schott: A renewed slowdown in the economy—again led by housing and automobiles—is now in the making, provided the Federal Reserve sticks to the objective of curbing the growth of the aggregates. Interest rates in excess of previous peaks may be required to accomplish the objective, partly because there are no direct credit restraints and partly because some sectors of the financial market are still in a relatively liquid position. The alternative to restraint now is even more restraint later since underlying inflationary forces are very strong.
Wojnilower: Economic activity is still expanding rapidly, though less so than a few weeks ago. Except for usury-related kinks in bank credit for autos, credit is freely available. There is virtually no institutional interest in long-term fixed-rate bonds, nor is such likely to revive in view of the impending conflict between fiscal and monetary policy.
