Auto sales in the first week of October have been the best in months for area dealers. Ohio dealers have benefited substantially from a state sales tax reduction from 4 percent to 2 percent since mid-September. (K cars did not qualify for the tax reduction). Several dealers are encouraged by favorable initial response to 1981 models, but they believe that improved sales represent buying ahead and that November and December sales may weaken as a result. Several dealers are concerned about consumer response to the higher prices of 1981 models. Interest rates on auto loans, which in some areas has moved up to 16 percent, have not yet hindered auto sales partly because company financing is available at below market rates.
