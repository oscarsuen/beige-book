Last month's general feeling of optimism turned to one of concern as higher interest rates threatened to stall the recovery in home building. Consumers are still cautious in the use of credit and are postponing major purchases. Merchants are reacting by keeping inventories lean. Employment brightened in August but may be less buoyant in September due to the ripple effect of slower housing demand and weaker retail sales.
Although traffic is high at most new car dealer showrooms, sales have only been fair. Dealers are not optimistic about new car sales over the next three months. Consumers are taking a "wait and see" approach on the performance of the widely promoted American-made fuel-efficient cars. Many consider them overpriced. Inventories are at low levels by designâ€”carrying charges have been rising rapidly.
Capital investment plans are mixed at this time. Northern Alabama businessmen are leery of making plant expansions or building inventories because of escalating interest rates, but in south Florida, firms are said to be still expanding with minor exceptions. Backlogs at high-technology companies are the highest ever. In Louisiana, industrial construction is strong due to continued petrochemical expansion.
