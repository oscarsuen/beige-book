Activity in the district apparently strengthened moderately in the past two months, but remains well below the levels of either the first quarter or last year. No substantial revival is expected for the next several months. Consumer buying is sluggish. Capital spending, overall, is in a downward phase. Inventories are lean and under tight control. Wholesale prices are strengthening again after a brief period of discounting last summer. Housing remains severely depressed. Farm income prospects have improved. Credit is generally available, but high rates and tighter lending standards hold down new credits. Complaints of "slow pay" by businesses and consumers are widespread.
Purchasing managers in Chicago and Milwaukee report that the modest improvement they noted in August continued in September. For many companies, however, this means merely a slower rate of decline. Some uptrend in orders, output, and employment has occurred, but activity remains well below the levels of the first quarter. Prices paid are strengthening again.
Airline traffic has been declining for several months. In September passenger miles on trunk airlines were 13.5 percent below year ago. Advance bookings and customer surveys suggest the picture will weaken further. The recession and higher fares, up 14.0 percent on full-pay tickets, are blamed.
Steel orders have improved since early July. Operations have moved from a low of 50 percent of capacity to about 75 percent, but remain well below the levels of 1979 or early 1980. Some laid off steel workers have been recalled, and closed furnaces have been started up. Lead times on sheets have returned to normal, but leads on most other products remain short. Steel inventories at all levels have been low for the past year, which explains the up and dawn nature of steel demand.
Nonresidential construction is at a high rate, but is expected to decline in 1981. A large volume of work is in the planning stage, with contracts expected to be let some months hence. Financing will be a problem unless the insurance companies return in force to the commercial mortgage market which they largely closed off in late August.
