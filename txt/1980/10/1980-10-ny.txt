Business activity in the Second District continued weak in September. Although retail sales were uneven for the month, some strengthening is anticipated in the coming months. Automobile purchases remained slow. The outlook for car sales is very uncertain because of rising interest rates and recent price hikes for domestic models. Outside the consumer sector, some increase in demand has been reported for machine-tool makers and is also expected for chemicals. The respondents, for the most part, do not expect any major economic recovery until the latter half of 1981. On the financial side, reports indicate that lending terms for automobile purchases remained unchanged during September. In the housing market, however, credit conditions have tightened considerably.
Automobile sales in the Second District were also mixed in September. Foreign car sales appeared better than in the comparable month last year, while domestic car sales were reported to have "declined drastically" since the beginning of the month. Used car sales also appeared to be depressed. The October 1 price increases combined with the high financing costs were cited as likely to hurt sales in upcoming months. Although the report from a major automobile manufacturer suggests a very sharp increase in sales by the third quarter of 1981, the present outlook is described as "nervous". Particular concern was raised over sales of leftover 1980 models and of the 1981 models which are not in the new fuel-efficient lines. At the same time, however, it is believed that energy considerations are fading in consumers' minds. Both manufacturers and dealers are deeply concerned over the effects of rising interest rates on the costs of financing 1981 inventories. Some dealers are considering trimming their inventories again, although they fear the reduced selection of cars for potential buyers could hurt sales in future months.
Riefler: While wide swings in both interest rates and money supply figures should be viewed as normal for periods of high and volatile inflation, they were exaggerated this year by the imposition and subsequent withdrawal of the Credit Control Program. It is essential to the Fed's credibility and to curtailing inflationary expectations that the Fed hit its annual money supply targets. I see some tentative early signs that the move upward in rates may be having some effect on inflationary expectations: in commodity prices plateauing, stability and strength of the dollar, and better performance of the bond market.
Schott: The recent interest rate run-up is closely related to market perceptions of the deteriorating fiscal 1981 Federal budget picture. Precautionary business borrowing—short-term and long-term—is also again a factor. By standing firm now, the Federal Reserve may be able to nip in the bud the potential need for another crunch. The market may then realize that renewed rapid economic expansion is not actually in the cards.
Wojnilower: The tone of asset markets has become more strongly bullish. Now bond prices have joined, triggered mainly by reports that Chairman Volcker had asserted the market had overanticipated the rise in money rates. If Ml does not erupt again, concerns as to housing weakness and "double-dip" are apt to recede. My own forecast remains for a relatively robust business upturn with some tendency for inflation to reaccelerate.
