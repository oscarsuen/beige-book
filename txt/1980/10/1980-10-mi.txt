September's rise in interest rates has slowed but not stalled the district recovery we've reported for the last two months. The higher interest rates reduced home sales and inventories and discouraged some bank lending. Retail sales and manufacturing activity continued to improve, though, and auto sales started to pick up. Also, generally favorable weather and high prices cheered district farmers.
One district industry not noticeably affected by the higher interest rates is miningâ€”but unfortunately it is still depressed for other reasons. Reduced steel demand is still holding down iron ore shipments from Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Copper mining in Montana is still shut down by a strike. And 1,500 of 2,500 striking workers lost their jobs in September when the Anaconda Company closed its copper smelting operations in Anaconda and Great Falls.
