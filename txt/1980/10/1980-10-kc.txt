Manufacturers' Inventories and Input Prices. Although almost all of the purchasing agents contacted report a stabilizing of input prices in recent months, over half feel that this trend will not last, and that prices will resume rising by yearend. Most input lead times are considered short, but are expected to start lengthening because most suppliers no longer have excess inventory. Most purchasing agents are ordering less than last year, and are trying to reduce materials inventories.
Deposits at most Tenth District banks contacted rose this past month, with six-month and 30-month certificates showing the greatest strength in response to the rise in interest rates. Demand deposits experienced moderate growth in regions with strong economic activity and are flat in most other areas.
