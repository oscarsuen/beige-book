The consensus of about 40 economists—mainly from important industrial firms and commercial banks in the District—who attended the Fourth District Business Economists Round Table Meeting held at the Bank on January 26 is that gains in GNP, both in current dollars and in real terms, will moderate during the year. The rate of inflation is expected to accelerate, and there are indications that capital spending will remain strong throughout 1973.
The median forecast of the business economists is for a GNP of $1,264 billion in 1973, with real growth of 6.1 percent and an increase in the price deflator of 3.4 percent. A further upward surge in prices is expected during the first quarter, generated largely by food and fuels, but also by the Phase III program. Some support for this view has been provided already by the Cleveland purchasing agents' report for January, which shows a sharp increase in the percent of firms paying higher prices. On the other hand, some of our industrialist directors reported that they have instructed all divisions of their firms to operate on the Phase II basis until the rules of Phase III are clarified in order that their companies do not become cases.
