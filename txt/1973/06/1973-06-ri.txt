Results of our most recent survey of businessmen and bankers indicate that the Fifth District economy remains in a strong advance, with the manufacturing sector continuing to gain momentum. Further increases in manufacturers’ shipments, new orders and backlogs are reported, while manufacturers’ inventories have apparently declined further in recent weeks. It now appears that for a significant number of manufacturers, inventory levels are lower than desired. Increases in retail sales evident in recent months are continuing while construction outlays apparently remain on the rise. According to a special survey, the mortgage markets have tightened significantly in recent weeks.
Increases in shipments, new orders and backlogs were reported by more than 50 percent of the manufacturing respondents in the latest survey. Among the manufacturers reporting gains were producers of synthetic fibers, chemicals, and steel. Nearly one-half of the manufacturing respondents reported declines in inventories, while one-fifth indicated that inventory levels are too low relative to sales prospects. Nearly one-third of the manufacturing respondents reported that current plant and equipment capacity is inadequate.
Banking respondents report that the demand for all types of loans continues strong. Increases in the demand for business, consumer and mortgage loans were reported by more than 60 percent of all banking respondents. Bankers also indicate that both residential and nonresidential construction activity increased in their areas during the past month. Some overbuilding of residential apartments is reported in parts of the Carolinas. Contacts with several major builders in the District suggest that the proposed changes in real estate tax shelters have not had any noticeable impact on construction activity.
