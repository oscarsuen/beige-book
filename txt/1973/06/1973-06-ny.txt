The Second District Directors who were contacted recently generally felt that prices will continue to rise rapidly in the months ahead, albeit at a more moderate pace than has been experienced recently. A good deal of concern was expressed over the possibility that continued price increases might lead to inflationary wage settlements.	Despite the stability of the overall rate of unemployment, the Directors have seen increasing evidence of tightness in the labor market, especially shortages of skilled labor. None of the Directors expressed apprehension over the large buildup in consumer credit during the past several months. A number of respondents expected the rise to taper off in coming months, along with a moderation of the demand for consumer durables. The real estate specialists who were contacted expressed mixed opinions on the implications of the proposed changes in the tax treatment of some income from real estate investments, but most foresaw little impact on overall construction activity.
Upward pressures on wages, moreover, were considered likely to be intensified by conditions in the labor market, which, as in previous months, were generally reported to be tightening. Special note was taken of shortages of skilled workers, including managerial and technical personnel.
The president of the retail firm reported that there were now some indications of a slowing in the rate of growth of such credit, and the New York banker expected the rate of growth in the sale of consumer durables to slacken significantly over the next year, with a concomitant slowdown in the rise of consumer credit. While the Buffalo branch Directors have observed no signs of any weakening of consumer willingness to incur additional debt, some noted a growing concern by the public regarding economic conditions that could lead to a slackening in the use of credit later in the year.
Several construction industry specialists at New York banks, insurance companies, and mortgage firms were queried regarding the possible adverse effects on construction activity of the proposed change in tax legislation, mentioned in the St. Louis Bank telegram, that would curb the use of some real estate tax shelters. One observer forecast a drastic decline in the number of individual investors in the real estate business. Most respondents, however, felt that the impact on construction activity of the proposed change was likely to be very limited.
