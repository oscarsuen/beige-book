Business conditions in the Third District are generally favorable. Production activity is still brisk and expected to improve further. Labor markets are holding steady with small increases in payroll and work week possible by year end. A considerable number of firms are increasing their inventories in anticipation of further sales advances; retailers are experiencing good demand for their summer sportswear lines. Construction activity has slowed somewhat. Bankers are feeling the beginnings of loan demand pressure, and inflation continues to plague the District.
Production activity is maintaining last month's brisk pace. Over half of the respondents to this month's business outlook survey report sales and shipments unchanged, and a substantial 35 percent reported sales advances. While a small minority of the local manufacturers are experiencing a drop in sales, the six month outlook is bright. The majority of respondents anticipate increased sales and shipments.
Overall, construction activity in the Third District is down slightly, particularly in the nonresidential and public works sectors. Bright spots are the Atlantic City metropolitan area, where increases in resort homes are boosting the local economy, and the Wilkes Barre area, which is still hard at work rebuilding from the disastrous hurricane floods of last year.
Over half of the survey respondents report paying higher prices for raw materials, and nearly 60 percent report that they are keeping their awn prices steady. No relief is expected, with well over half of area executives queried anticipating a worsening of the situation.
