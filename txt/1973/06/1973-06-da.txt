The economy of the Eleventh District is continuing to expand, although the expansion appears less widespread than in earlier recent months. Industrial production in Texas continued to increase in April, but employment in the five District states declined slightly. The pace of construction activity also slowed in April. And although sales of District department stores rose substantially in May, automobile registrations in April were sharply below their previous month's levels.
In response to a survey of the nonbanking Directors of the Bank, only a third of the respondents indicated that their companies have altered their 1973 plans for plant and equipment expenditures since the first of the year. Those indicating that their companies' capital spending plans have been altered stated that these plans have been scaled up only moderately. The majority of the Directors also felt that the current inventory-sales ratios for their companies were not below their desired long-run levels. However, most of those with companies having abnormally low inventory-sales ratios indicated that they were unable to build their stocks because of rising sales.
The seasonally adjusted Texas industrial production index rose sharply in April as every industry category reported an increase over the month before. The manufacturing sector was again primarily responsible for the rise, although both mining and utilities also showed monthly increases. In manufacturing, substantial monthly increases were reported in leather and leather products, petroleum refining, printing and publishing, primary metals, and apparel products. In mining, crude petroleum and metal, stone, and earth minerals reported the largest monthly increases as natural gas and natural gas liquids rose only slightly. Utilities also reported a small gain over the revised level in March.
The value of construction contracts awarded in the five District states fell slightly in April as both residential and nonresidential building slipped from their March levels. Spurred by large volume contracts in Louisiana and Texas, nonbuilding construction was the only category to show an increase. The cumulative value of contracts awarded through April of this year fell to a level only 6.2 percent above the corresponding period last year.
