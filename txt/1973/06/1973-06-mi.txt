Ninth District manufacturing activity has expanded vigorously in recent months, and District retailers have enjoyed sizable sales gains. However, reports disclose that some slowing may occur in both areas during the last half of 1973. Transportation problems continue to plague the District and several materials are in short supply. Interest rates have generally not risen at rural, agriculturally oriented banks but have moved up at large urban banks. Business loan demand is characterized as strong throughout the District. If real estate tax shelters are eliminated, District construction activity will be curbed.
According to our latest industrial expectations survey, first quarter District manufacturing sales exceeded year-earlier levels by 21.8 percent, and a 17.2 percent second quarter sales increase is anticipated. These record-breaking sales gains noticeably exceed both durable and nondurable goods respondents' last February's sales expectations. During the last half of 1973, however, District manufacturers look for a marked slowdown in their sales growth. District manufacturing sales are expected to be up 12.5 percent in the third quarter and increase 8.1 percent in the fourth quarter.
Bank Directors disclose that District retailers generally have been recording quite strong sales gains and attribute these increases to favorable economic conditions rather than to consumers' desires to avoid future price increases. However, one Director associated with the retail trade industry indicates that the anticipated slowdown in consumer spending may be occurring already: his firm's May sales growth was down markedly from the prior four months. Several other Twin Cities area retailers reveal that they expect their sales growth to soften this fall and some anticipate relative sales gains in the last half of 1973 to be below comparable 1972 sales advances. Outside the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area, Directors report that retailers generally look for continued strong sales growth and that much of this optimism stems from the favorable outlook for District farm income this year.
