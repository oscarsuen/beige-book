The Tenth District economy looks very good, although our respondents had a few complaints. The ability of bankers to loan is being squeezed as deposit inflows weaken while business loan demand does not. Auto dealers are disappointed that big cars have stopped selling well, but they allow that customers are buying up small cars fast. Farmers are having to pay much higher prices for their supplies, but stand to make a net gain because of the favorable price situation for agricultural products. The overall strength of the regional economy is summarized by retail sales totals, which continue to rise. This healthy business situation would be dealt a severe blow, according to our special respondents on tax shelters, if investment funds now flowing heavily into cattle and construction were suddenly cut back by tax reform.
Retail sales continue to boom in the Tenth District. Most department store executives said sales were up in May over April, and running considerably ahead of last year. The increase seems to be fairly widespread among all types of products. Some of the executives singled out women's apparel as a strong seller. Most stores reported a continued high volume of durable goods sales. Furniture and appliances are still selling especially well. What was earlier described as an "excellent" year for auto sales is now being characterized as "good" by dealers throughout the Tenth District. Respondents almost universally cite the gas shortage, or the threat of a shortage, as being responsible for a shift in demand from luxury cars to economy cars. As the current model year draws to a close, compact cars and pick-up trucks are in short supply.
According to several builders, realtors, and investment counselors, private capital that is financing the construction of office buildings and housing units, especially multi-family dwellings, would be greatly reduced should the tax shelter reform proposal be enacted. Estimates of the amount of new construction that would be dried up ranged from 20 to 60 percent. The individuals contacted foresee a severe shock to the economy should the proposal become law without a transitional phase.
Owners and operators of cattle feedlots, as well as investment counselors knowledgeable in cowboy economics, also were asked about the probable effects of removing the tax shelter. The feedlot managers acknowledge that prepayment of expenses is the rule, and that many of the owners live as far away as Connecticut. Investment counselors estimate that a third of the cattle on feed in the country, and 60 percent of those in major feedlots, are owned by individuals attracted by the tax shelter aspects. Removing the tax shelter, therefore, would drive down the price of feeder cattle, reducing the supply and increasing the price of beef over time.
