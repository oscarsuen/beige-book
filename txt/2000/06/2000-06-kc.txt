The Tenth District economy showed some signs of cooling in May but remained generally solid.  Retail sales were flat, factory activity edged down from high levels earlier in the year, and residential construction slowed following recent interest rate increases.  In contrast, commercial building remained strong and district energy activity increased after holding steady earlier in the year.  In the farm economy, low crop prices continued to be a concern.  Labor markets remained tight, with wage pressures similar to previous surveys.  Prices for manufacturing materials continued to rise, and some firms passed these cost increases through to output prices.   Construction material prices increased seasonally, while retail prices were largely unchanged.
