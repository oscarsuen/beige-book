The Seventh District economy remained strong, but the pace of expansion moderated further in April and May.  Consumer spending growth softened notably and many retailers suggested that sales results in the Midwest were not as good as in some other regions.  Growth in construction activity slowed slightly again, but both residential and nonresidential activity was described as strong.  While production generally remained robust, manufacturers reported more mixed conditions.  Lenders reported solid, steady loan demand from businesses, but moderately softer demand on the consumer side.  Worker shortages and wage pressures persisted in the District, but neither showed signs of intensifying over the last two months.  District farmland values rose 2 percent during the first quarter.  Corn planting was essentially complete and topsoil moisture levels improved with timely rainfall in recent weeks.
