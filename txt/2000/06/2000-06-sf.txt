Reports from contacts indicate solid expansion of the Twelfth District economy in recent weeks, although signs of moderation were apparent in some sectors.  Sales of services and retail merchandise were strong.  District manufacturers reported generally solid conditions, although weaker demand was evident in a few sectors.  Conditions among District agricultural producers were mixed, as demand conditions were stronger for ranchers than for growers.  Real estate market and construction activity slowed a bit in the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain states but remained very strong in California and Arizona.  District financial institutions reported somewhat tighter credit conditions.  Labor markets remained tight in most areas, and elevated energy costs were passed on to the prices of transportation services and petroleum-based products.
In regard to price developments, sustained high prices for oil and other energy sources have raised producers' costs in recent weeks and have been passed on to the final prices of some goods and services.  The prices of petroleum-based materials such as containers, plastic bags, and fertilizers have increased, raising costs for manufacturers, retailers, and agricultural producers.  Airlines and trucking companies have raised passenger airline fares and shipping rates in response to high fuel costs.  Apart from these items, however, materials costs and final  prices of goods and services remained fairly stable, due to competitive pressures and productivity gains.
Demand for services to businesses and households grew substantially in most areas.  Sales growth has been especially rapid for telecommunications and Internet-related services, although contacts in California and Washington reported difficulty obtaining electronic telecommunication equipment, such as switches and fiber optic cable, to support further expansion.  Demand for transportation services--both for passengers and for shipping--remained robust.  Visitor arrivals to Hawaii picked up further, but in Utah hotel occupancy rates and revenues declined somewhat, as growth in the supply of hotel rooms has outpaced demand there.
