The Ninth District economy starts the new millennium at full speed. The construction, manufacturing, energy and mining industries remain robust. Moreover, consumer spending continues to increase. While cattle producers' financial conditions have improved, other agricultural producers are still struggling. Meanwhile, the continued tight labor markets are generating hiring difficulties and wage pressure. Overall prices show some signs of acceleration.
District homebuilding has recently cooled down. Housing units authorized for the district decreased almost 3 percent for the three-month period ending in November compared to a year earlier. In Minneapolis/St. Paul, housing units authorized dropped over 4 percent for the three-month period ending in November compared to a year earlier. A Minneapolis/St. Paul building association representative claims the slowdown from a vigorous pace "may mean we can get our building cycle back to a normal timeframe."
