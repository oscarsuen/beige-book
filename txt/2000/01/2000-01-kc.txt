Tenth District economic activity remained solid in December.  Retailers reported exceptional holiday sales, residential construction held steady, and activity in the energy sector continued to improve.  In the farm economy, crop prices remained low but cash flow problems eased due to good crop yields, higher livestock prices, and big government subsidies.  The only sign of a slowdown was in manufacturing, where activity edged down after improving the previous several months.  Labor markets remained very tight, with wage pressures still evident but no higher than in previous surveys.  Retail prices were unchanged, while prices for some construction and manufacturing materials continued to rise.
