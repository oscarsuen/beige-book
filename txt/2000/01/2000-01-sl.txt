The District economy continues to grow at a steady pace despite slowing in the real estate sector and ongoing weakness in the agricultural sector.  Although most retailers report that holiday sales were up between 4 and 5 percent from a year earlier, many said that this growth was below expectations.  Manufacturers report continued growth in demand, although shortages of workers still plague most sectors.  Home sales and construction, which began to slow in late summer, continued this trend through year-end 1999.  Real estate lending has, consequently, fallen off.  Increases in consumer and commercial lending have offset the decline, however.  The fall harvest was better than expected, and the winter wheat crop is in fair-to-good condition.
District car dealers report that December sales increased on average about 4 percent when compared with the same period a year earlier.  However, sales were not evenly distributed.  Dealers who had the inventory saw relatively strong sales gains, upwards of 20 percent in some instances.  Those who did not have, or could not get, the inventory saw large sales declines.  Contacts generally do not believe that recent higher gas prices affected sales, even of sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks.  Dealers are optimistic about the first quarter of 2000, with some predicting as much as a 10 percent sales increase over first quarter 1999.
Despite the strong economy, a small number of closings have been reported, most notably a trucking company that closed in December, taking with it 1,000 jobs.  A Memphis steel plant closed because of financial problems, eliminating 250 jobs, while a producer of telephone cables laid off 300 workers because of a mild slowdown in the telecommunications industry.
Tight labor markets continue to stifle some businesses, as District unemployment rates remain at record lows.  Contacts report that some construction projects are still behind schedule because of high worker turnover and a lack of available skilled workers.  The shortage of workers also affected retailers, who were forced to search for holiday help much earlier than usual, offer more flexible hours and, in a few cases, increase pay to compete for workers.  Several Target stores, for example, raised the starting hourly wage for some of their seasonal workers by almost 50 percent.  All told, though, wage increases appear to be limited.
