The Seventh District economy continued to expand moderately in November and December, while wage and price pressures remained generally subdued.  Retailers in the District generally reported that holiday sales met or exceeded their expectations.  Overall construction activity softened somewhat in recent weeks but remained relatively strong.  Manufacturers indicated that production remained high, but pockets of softness persisted.  Bankers continued to report strong demand for business loans and slowing household lending activity.  Worker shortages persisted in the District while reports of intensifying wage pressures remained isolated. Farm commodity prices remained depressed and District pork producers have responded to low prices by reducing the size of their herds.
The century rollover turned out to be a non-event for nearly all of our contacts.  There were no reports of significant inventory buildups ahead of, or overhangs following, the changeover period.  There were no reports of major computer glitches disrupting general business operations, although a few minor problems were noted.
