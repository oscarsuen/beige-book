In December, Eleventh District economic               activity remained strong. The service sector reported strong demand,               and most retailers said sales were strong. The energy industry continued               to rebound, but there were signs of cooling for refining and petrochemicals.               Construction and real estate activity also was quite strong, with               the exception of home building, which was "slower than usual." Manufacturers               reported activity at roughly the same level reported in the last               Beige Book, but there were signs of weakening for some construction-related               products. Lending activity was unchanged, and deposit growth was               up. Agricultural conditions remained dry.
Labor markets have eased in some areas but continue               to be very tight in parts of the District, particularly in Austin               and the Rio Grande Valley, where contacts say it is difficult to               find skilled labor and wages are up. Auto dealers reported difficulty               finding workers, and legal and trucking firms say they have raised               salaries. Temporary service firms also reported very tight labor               markets, but wage increases have been only "minor," which one contact               called "surprising." Construction contractors, such as framers,               were looking for work in December after being in very high demand               for the past few years.
