The District economy remains on a strong               growth trajectory, with continued low rates of joblessness and,               possibly, a small uptick in wage growth. Still, underlying price               pressures appear to be somewhat light.
District temporary employment agencies reported               a seasonal downturn in demand for general laborers. However, strong               demand for administrative assistants, clerical workers, and legal               secretaries continued unabated. Demand for seasonal retail help               was also quite strong in December. Overall, our contacts expressed               continued difficulty finding and retaining qualified workers, and               an increasing number of temp agencies are offering improved benefits               packages and bonuses to attract experienced workers. Continued strong               demand for temporary workers is expected at least through the spring.
Union sources reported that wage growth continued               to edge up in most industries, with estimates ranging from 3 percent               to 3  percent. Job security is still the focal point of union contract               negotiations, however, and our contacts indicated that, where possible,               workers seem willing to trade some wage gains for added job protection.
Commercial builders noted a steady improvement               in project startups, and business in this sector is reportedly quite               good. In the Cincinnati/northern Kentucky region, the pace of commercial               building seems to have picked up in the past several months. In               northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, a recovering manufacturing               sector is beginning to spur demand for more warehouse and industrial               space. Columbus builders reported high activity levels, although               the brisk pace of new building in this region seems to have slowed               down a bit as of late.
The availability of building materials has improved               in the industry, and accordingly, price increases appear to have               eased a bit after having peaked at midyear.
Most steel industry contacts reported an improving               demand for steel. Book orders for all steel products are improved               for the first quarter. Prices are strengthening and are expected               to increase further this spring. All companies reported inventories               commensurate with current sales levels, although there is a general               anticipation of even stronger sales numbers later this year.
Purchasing managers in the District reported a               modest increase in the growth rate of commodity prices in November.               Primary metals, paper, and chemicals prices were notably higher               in November than earlier in the year. Manufacturers' Y2K stockpiles               were small (generally less than one week's inventory), and no significant               disruptions due to inventory overhangs are expected. Virtually all               companies reported that business and plant operating computers were               functioning normally following the transition to 2000.
Few retailers built up inventories as a precaution               against Y2K-related disruptions. Much of the stockpiling took the               form of earlier-than-usual shipments of spring merchandise. Indeed,               some retailers reported lower-than-usual inventories for the season.
Retailers with online sales outlets reported exceptionally               strong sales for the holiday period. Internet sales were about four               times higher this holiday season than last year. One Fourth District               retailer reported that sales via the Internet were so strong that               the company experienced inventory shortfalls.
Sales of new vehicles varied from steady to brisk               for District dealers in December. Contacts believe that unseasonably               warm weather may have helped boost new car demand. For many District               auto dealers, 1999 was their second consecutive record sales year.               Consumer demand for light trucks was a key factor in last year's               strong sales numbers, and District auto dealers are attempting to               bolster their inventories of new trucks. Our contacts foresee continued               strong sales for the next few months.
Credit quality is high as banks have become increasingly               selective in their loan applications. Willingness to lend remains               high, but banks reported that it is very difficult to attract deposits               at rates that provide an adequate margin above lending rates. Indeed,               as has been the case for much of the past several years, the spread               between borrowing and lending rates is reportedly narrow because               of fierce competition in the loans market.
No significant Y2K-related disruptions were               reported in the District, and Y2K-related currency withdrawals by               bank depositors seem to have been modest overall and much less than               had been anticipated. However, deposits were reportedly down slightly               in December, as people satisfied their liquidity demands by cashing               their regular paychecks rather than depositing them.
