On balance, the Fifth District economy expanded at a rapid pace in December and into the new year. District retailers recorded better-than-expected sales gains both during and after the holidays. At District services firms, revenues were higher and employment picked up. In manufacturing, shipments and new orders continued to show moderate gains. In contrast, real estate activity was somewhat slower in December and lending activity at District banks was little changed. In District labor markets, employment continued to grow moderately in most sectors while wages continued to advance at a brisk pace, especially at retail and service firms.
Commercial real estate slowed somewhat more than usual in recent weeks, except in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., and around Charlotte, N.C. Office and retail rents were said to be flat in the District of Columbia. A contact from Columbia, S.C., told us that downtown office space was in ample supply, but that suburban office space was tight. In Richmond, Va., a realtor noted that vacancy rates for industrial space had increased recently, and as a result, rents were expected to soften during the first quarter of 2000. In Charleston, W.V., a slowdown in office and retail leasing activity was said to reflect, in part, more professionals purchasing rather than leasing office space.
