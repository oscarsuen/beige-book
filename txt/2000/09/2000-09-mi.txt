Economic growth in the Ninth District shows signs of slowing. The construction, tourism, and manufacturing industries as well as consumer spending have softened. Meanwhile, energy and mining activity continues at a robust pace. In agriculture, most district farmers expect a bin-busting harvest, but crop prices remain low. A drought and fires have hurt most Montana farmers and ranchers. Labor markets are still tight as businesses struggle to attract and retain workers. Some price increases are noted, primarily in housing, natural gas, electricity and paper.
Homebuilding remains soft. Housing units authorized are down 6 percent in the district for the three-month period ending in July compared with a year earlier. In Minneapolis-St. Paul the number of residential sales decreased 7 percent for July compared with last year; however, the median price for a home in Minneapolis-St. Paul in July was up 12 percent over a year earlier.
Summer tourism decreased in several parts of the district, except for Minnesota and Wisconsin. Traffic crossings at the International Bridge at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., were down 7 percent in August compared with last year, indicating a drop in tourism activity for the Upper Peninsula. A bank director reports sales down 1 percent to 10 percent compared with a year ago at various district tourism businesses. Montana forest fires have hurt outfitters and guest ranches; however, the fire fighting effort has added $1 million per day to supporting businesses in the affected areas, according to a bank director. A chamber of commerce representative in Wisconsin reports full bookings at resorts and brisk restaurant business this summer. According to a survey of tourism businesses in Minnesota, the number of visitors was up over a year earlier.
A potential bumper crop has many Ninth District farmers scrambling for storage space. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports corn and soybean progress ahead of the five-year average for many district states. Meanwhile, with many farmers still storing their 1999 crop, grain storage manufacturing companies report strong demand for storage silos.
District manufacturing wages for July are up 3.2 percent compared with a year earlier. Wages for field and livestock workers in the district climbed over 6 percent in July compared with last year. A Minnesota building product manufacturing company is increasing wages 4 percent, but predicts that improved productivity will offset the increase in labor costs. A recent 78-day strike at a soft drink bottling company in the Minneapolis area ended with a settlement that included about a 2.7 percent increase in wages.
Increases were noted in energy and input prices. Winter heating costs are expected to increase from last year due to higher oil and natural gas prices. Diesel fuel prices are up almost 30 percent compared with a year earlier. Montana electricity prices for large firms have reached record levels since May. Paper prices have increased for 15 consecutive months. A recent informal survey of manufacturers in the Dakotas, Minnesota, and Wisconsin shows that about 40 percent of respondents report higher input prices.
