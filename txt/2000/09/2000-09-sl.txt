Some moderation in the pace of District economic activity has been noticed since the last report.  Retail sales are up this year over last, despite some sluggish back-to-school sales.  Overall, retail sales generally met expectations.  Business contacts report that sales of apparel have slowed somewhat recently.  Home sales and construction continue their downward trends.  Banks are still experiencing lethargic deposit growth, although loan growth remains relatively steady.  Demand for real estate loans, however, has continued to decline along with the demand for new homes.  Dry, hot weather in the southern parts of the District has dramatically affected the quality of the soybean and cotton crops.
Car dealers report that sales in July and August were down slightly from a year earlier.  About a third of contacts cite a lack of inventory of some models and higher interest rates for the sluggish sales.  About another third have excess inventories that they have tried to pare by increasing the dollar amounts and availability of rebates.  Sales prices, however, remain unchanged from last year.  Even though car dealers report somewhat erratic sales so far this year, most expect to finish the year with double-digit sales increases over last year.
Internet companies continue to locate in the District.  In Louisville, for example, a web-based insurer will create almost 200 jobs, and an Internet service center is hiring 290 for its expansion.  In northern Kentucky, a large clothing company will open a distribution center and hire about 850 workers.
Several closings are also occurring in the District.  In Memphis, FedEx plans to cut 200 technology jobs, and an electronics firm will send more than 300 manufacturing jobs abroad in the next three months.  The recent tire recall forced Ford to close an assembly plant near St. Louis for two weeks to free up needed tires.
With qualified workers difficult to find, labor shortages continue to be a problem for nearly all industries, although contacts note that wage pressures have been negligible.  With gasoline prices moderating, trucking companies are starting to feel some relief from the profit cuts they had previously been forced to accept.
Mirroring sales, residential construction has been declining throughout the District over the past two months when compared with a year earlier.  Monthly and year-to-date residential building permits are down from their month- and year-earlier levels.  Commercial construction has recently been mixed.  In some areas, such as western Tennessee, builders report a decline in the number of new projects, while in other regions, such as the Louisville area, construction remains brisk, with several large projects under way.  St. Louis has felt the effect of the eight-week-long concrete drivers' strike, which held up numerous construction projects.
