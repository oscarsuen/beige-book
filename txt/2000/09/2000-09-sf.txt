Reports from contacts indicate overall solid performance across the Twelfth District economy in recent weeks.  District retailers reported moderate sales gains and service providers noted an acceleration in growth above an already rapid trend.  Manufacturing activity in the District picked up slightly, boosted by strong demand for high-tech products.  Reports from District agricultural producers generally were favorable.  Residential and commercial real estate activity remained at high levels, although slower home sales tempered growth in construction in some states.  District financial conditions remained healthy, with intense competition for quality borrowers.  Respondents reported that surging energy costs and rising employee compensation were beginning to damp profits, as competitive pressures kept producers from passing increased costs to consumers.
With regard to prices, contacts noted that increased fuel and energy prices continued to affect production costs in a wide variety of industries.  Surging electricity prices over the last several months prompted aluminum producers in the Pacific Northwest to curtail production and boosted irrigation and greenhouse costs for many agricultural producers in the District.  Contacts noted that rising electricity prices also have raised operating expenses at hotels, theaters, and amusement parks, particularly in San Diego.  Higher fuel prices have prompted freight companies to impose surcharges and caused merchandise vendors to ask wholesale customers to pay separately for shipping.  Despite rising costs, contacts noted that competitive pressure has prevented most producers from raising prices of final goods and services.
Service industry respondents in most District states reported strong growth.  Demand for telecommunications, data communications, and cable television services picked up in recent weeks, producing material shortages, particularly for digital devices.  Demand for software and information processing services intensified recently, as businesses resumed work on information technology projects postponed during Y2K and looked to satisfy unmet labor needs in part with technology.  Container traffic through the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles accelerated during the survey period, lifting port activity to record highs.  In California and Hawaii, strong demand for hotels pushed occupancy rates up and boosted room prices.
District energy producers reported strong demand for oil, natural gas, and electricity.  Fires resulted in the closure of two coal mines in Utah and increased demand for coal from remaining  mines.  As investment in energy projects has increased, contacts reported difficulty obtaining drilling rigs and extraction services.
