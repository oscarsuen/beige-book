Eleventh District economic activity remained fairly strong in August and early September. Most manufacturing and business service firms said they were operating at high levels, but reports were mixed, and there were some signs of softness. Retail sales continued to be weaker than in the first half of the year, but sales had strengthened slightly for some stores since the last report. Construction and real estate activity remained at high levels, and bankers said loan demand continued to be strong. Oil field activity continues to increase rapidly. Agricultural conditions remain very difficult; hot, dry weather has destroyed crops, impeded livestock production, raised costs, and delayed land preparation for fall planting.
