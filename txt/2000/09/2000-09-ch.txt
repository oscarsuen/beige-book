The Seventh District's economic expansion continued to slow in recent weeks.  Consumer spending was generally soft in August, but picked up in early September.  Nonresidential construction activity remained robust while sales of new and existing homes were slightly softer than a year ago.  Manufacturing activity remained strong, but reports increasingly suggested that growth slowed further.  Bankers noted that overall loan demand remained strong, and some reported a slight pickup in mortgage refinancing activity.  Contacts noted no respite from worker shortages in recent weeks, despite slightly higher unemployment rates.  District farmland values rose in the second quarter but at half the rate of increase in the previous two quarters.  Crop conditions remained good in most areas but had deteriorated modestly in recent weeks as hot, dry weather returned to the corn belt.  There were no new reports of broad-based price increases at the retail level and wage pressures remained generally subdued.  Contacts, however, more frequently expressed concern over substantial increases in health benefit costs.
