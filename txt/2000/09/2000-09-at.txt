Reports from across the District suggest that the pace of economic growth in the Southeast has continued to ease.  Descriptions of retail and auto sales growth were varied, but generally on the weaker side.  The single-family housing market remained flat to down slightly compared with a year ago, which is in contrast to the continued strength of the commercial market.  Contacts noted some planned expansion in manufacturing activity, and accounts by representatives of the tourism and hospitality sector were positive.  Bankers reported strong consumer and commercial loan demand with no major signs of deterioration in loan quality.  The demand for skilled labor continued to outstrip supply, while some easing in the pressure for lower-skilled workers was indicated.  Direct and secondary effects of higher energy and health care costs remained the most cited pressure on prices.  The agricultural sector continued to reel from the ongoing drought in many parts of the District.
The commercial real estate market continued to perform at strong levels and growth remained balanced overall.  Vacancy rates were generally low and absorption continued at a healthy pace across most of the region.  Contacts noted that developers and lenders have become increasingly cautious about speculative construction.
Energy and health care continued to be the primary sources of pressure on input costs, and increases in stainless steel prices, the price of plastic, and transportation charges were described as indirect results of rising energy prices.  A large District company was reportedly expecting a 14 percent increase in health insurance premiums in 2001.
