Growth in economic activity in the Fourth District has experienced little change since our last report, remaining moderate.  Prices are stable for most goods except for the rising price of fuel.  Wages continue to grow at a moderate pace. The fall in the rate of residential construction appears to have moderated.
The market for temporary workers is described as tight, particularly for administrative secretaries. The tightness is expected to be exacerbated as college students return to school.  All contacts indicated that demand for temporary workers is expected to increase over the next two months.  Retailers and trucking firms reported that filling positions has been very difficult.
Union contacts reported that recently negotiated contracts granted average wage increases of about 4 percent.  The public sector experienced wage increases that were somewhat above the private sector, reversing recent patterns when this sector has tended to lag. The union contacts also reported success in negotiating stronger employment security provisions.
Conditions in the commercial building sector appear to have held mostly steady since the last report, although a small decrease in industrial building and warehouse construction was noted.  No significant changes in labor and materials costs have been seen in this sector.
Heavy truck manufacturers expect cuts in production as large as 20 percent year-over-year due to the low sales they have seen over the past six months. High fuel prices and low used truck prices are reportedly responsible for low sales of new trucks. These companies also reported a small decline in the demand for trucking services. Orders are flat for heavy construction equipment.
Auto sales were quite strong in August when compared with previous months, particularly among those dealers whose manufacturers offered price reductions (often through rebates.)  Despite the strong August sales, year-to-date performance is slightly below last year's strong pace.  There is little evidence that total unit sales were affected by the increase in petroleum prices, although more consumers are choosing smaller cars with better gas mileage.  The market for used cars is also strong, and some contacts reported that this was caused by the high price of leased vehicles.
