Economic activity in the Third District has been moving up slowly.  Manufacturing orders and shipments have been rising modestly.  Retail sales rose for the back-to-school shopping period, although results were somewhat below retailers' expectations.  Auto sales have edged down.  Bank lending to businesses and consumers increased modestly, but residential mortgage lending declined.  Real estate markets remain tight, and home prices and commercial rents have been rising.  Although actual building activity remains fairly steady, construction contracting has eased.
The consensus in the Third District business community is that business activity will continue to move up.  Manufacturers expect growth to increase slightly.  Retailers look for somewhat better growth in sales this fall.  Auto dealers expect the current downtrend in sales to level off at a pace somewhat below the rate set in 1999 and the first half of this year.  Bankers expect continuing modest growth in lending to businesses and consumers, and they expect residential mortgage lending to remain steady.  Although some growth in commercial and residential construction is anticipated in parts of the region, overall building activity is expected to be nearly level through the rest of the year.
Manufacturers forecast somewhat better business conditions.  On balance, they expect slightly more rapid growth in orders in the months ahead compared with recent months.  However, some producers of transportation equipment noted that demand was slowing for trucks and autos, and they expect further declines.  Overall, capital spending plans for plants in the region include substantial increases.
Looking ahead, merchants are cautiously optimistic.  Sales of hard goods remain strong, and retailers believe consumer confidence is still high.  Store executives think that if apparel to be introduced later in the fall proves popular, overall growth in retail sales should accelerate.  Several large national chains plan to open new stores in growing suburban areas throughout the District, and this could provide the impetus for further gains.
Auto dealers generally indicated that the pace of sales has been easing, although some noted that luxury models have been selling well.  Dealers believe sales will settle to a steady rate for the balance of the year but remain below the relatively high pace set last year and earlier this year.
Third District bankers continue to describe loan margins as tight.  Some banks said they will consider implementing more restrictive credit standards in the fourth quarter, especially for commercial real estate loans, if the region's business conditions show any signs of weakening.  In general, however, bankers expect the current pace of economic activity to persist through the end of the year, and they do not anticipate significant changes in credit conditions.
Residential real estate activity has eased, according to brokers and builders.  Existing home sales have recently been running below the year-ago rate in most parts of the District, and new home sales have slipped from the pace set in the first quarter of this year.  However, some brokers and builders reported increased sales in areas where job growth has been strong and in newly developing suburban areas.  Despite the falloff in sales, some brokers indicated that price appreciation for existing homes has accelerated.  Builders generally noted continuing steady price increases for new homes.  Both builders and brokers anticipate a level pace of sales through the end of the year unless mortgage interest rates increase.
