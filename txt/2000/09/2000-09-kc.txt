The Tenth District economy remained solid overall in August.  Retail sales continued to improve, manufacturing activity was stable, and the energy sector expanded further. One area of weakness was residential real estate, which continued to cool.  In the farm economy, large corn and soybean harvests are expected to keep crop prices low.  Tightness in district labor markets eased slightly, and wage pressures were similar to the recent past.  While price pressures intensified for some manufacturing and construction materials, retail prices generally held steady.
