The Seventh District economy continued to expand moderately in September and the first three weeks of October.  Growth in consumer spending remained a little slower than earlier in the year and price inflation at the retail level generally remained subdued.  Nonresidential building activity was again robust and sales of both new and existing homes remained resilient.  Manufacturing activity was decidedly mixed, and the pricing environment for most manufactured goods remained very soft.  Overall lending activity picked up recently as household borrowing showed signs of a modest rebound.  The District's labor markets remained very tight, and concerns over rising health insurance costs were expressed more frequently.  The fall harvest progressed rapidly during October, with increased production by District farms contributing significantly to an expected record output for both corn and soybeans.
