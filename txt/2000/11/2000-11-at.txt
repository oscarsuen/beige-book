According to most reports the District's economic growth continues to moderate, and the general outlook is for some further slowing in the rate of growth over the coming months.  Although recent merchants' sales have generally met expectations, retailers are planning inventories conservatively for the coming holiday season.  Residential building activity and sales weakened and are expected to continue to slow through year-end.  Commercial real estate markets remain healthy, and there is little apparent risk of widespread overbuilding at this time.  A few large projects are stimulating an otherwise sluggish manufacturing sector.  The outlook for the tourism and hospitality industry is less positive than before, but still healthy.  Bankers report solid overall lending growth.  Tight labor markets and labor quality remain significant problems for many District employers.  Few manufacturing and retail firms say they have been able to pass on higher labor and fuel costs to their customers, resulting in increased pressure on profitability.  The District's agricultural sector has been severely affected by the drought.
Commercial real estate activity remained strong, with vacancy rates declining slightly in most markets.  However, several contractors around the District have reported that construction activity is slowing, backlogs are shrinking, and there have been net declines in occupied space in many areas.  Industry experts indicate that the market remains well positioned in general, and there continues to be little risk of oversaturation in the near term.
Increases in oil-related input costs and transportation fuel surcharges are widespread.  The rising cost of healthcare and other insurance programs continues to be a concern for many employers.
