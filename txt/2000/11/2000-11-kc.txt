The Tenth District economy expanded modestly in September and early October.  Retail sales and manufacturing activity rose slightly, and residential construction edged higher following recent declines.  Energy activity also continued to increase, as oil and gas prices remained high.  In contrast to these sectors, commercial construction remained flat.  In the farm economy, record corn and soybean harvests kept crop prices low.  District labor markets remained tight, with wage pressures up slightly from the recent past.  Prices continued to rise for some manufacturing materials, but builders reported a decline in lumber prices.  Retail prices were generally stable.
