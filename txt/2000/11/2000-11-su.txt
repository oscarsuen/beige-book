Reports from Federal Reserve Banks generally described the regional economies as growing at a moderate pace during September and early October, but with additional signs of slowing growth in some areas.  Activity in Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Boston was reported as growing at a moderate rate.  The pace of activity had eased in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas, while San Francisco and New York reported solid expansion in most industries.
Retail spending softened slightly in some Districts and the outlook was a little less positive for the tourism sector.  Manufacturing activity was generally steady, but some reports noted continuing problems because of labor shortages, higher fuel prices, and competition from imports.  Residential housing sales and construction activity continued to slow in most of the country.  Commercial real estate markets remained generally healthy, but some reports indicated that activity might be slowing.  Reports on agriculture were mixed, while the energy sector strengthened considerably.  Labor markets remained stretched, and some Districts indicated increasing wage pressures.  Reports also noted higher petroleum-based manufacturing input costs, although strong competition amongst producers continued to prevent the majority of firms from passing on much of the cost increases to their customers.
Reports on recent vehicle sales were mixed but still at generally high levels.  Sales in Kansas City were up slightly in September and early October, and dealers were largely successful at managing inventories during the model year changeover period.  Auto sales were better than a year ago in Chicago, and inventories were under control.  Sales were reported to have slowed in Philadelphia and Dallas, and to have been slightly below last year's record levels in Cleveland.
The outlook for the tourism and hospitality industry was a little less upbeat for the Atlanta and Richmond Districts; both reports expressed concern that rising fuel prices could discourage winter tourists.  Minneapolis reported that fall season tourism in its District was on par with a year ago.  San Francisco noted that healthy growth in tourism to Hawaii was boosting hotel occupancy rates and room prices.
Overall, commercial real estate markets continued to perform well, although there is increasing evidence that construction levels are waning a bit.  Contractors in the Atlanta region noted that construction backlogs had declined, and construction has slowed in the St. Louis District.  Vacancy rates retreated slightly in parts of the Atlanta, Kansas City, New York, and San Francisco Districts.  Site and utility inquiries have declined significantly in central Indiana.  Contract work shrank in the Dakotas and Minnesota.  In Manhattan, New York, despite rapidly escalating office rents, only a moderate volume of new construction is planned over the next few years.
In New York, there was a slight pickup in commercial and industrial sector loans, and in Philadelphia and Cleveland, banks reported slight increases in business lending activity.  Refinancing activity continued to decrease in New York, Kansas City, and Philadelphia, but increased in Chicago in recent weeks.  Atlanta and New York reported further weakening in demand for both residential and nonresidential mortgages.  Real estate and consumer loan demand remained unchanged in St. Louis.
Many contacts continued to express concerns about credit quality, although most reported that overall credit quality was still at healthy levels.  In New York, credit standards were tightened further on commercial and industrial borrowers.  Commercial lenders in Richmond were monitoring hotel and other commercial real estate loans closely.  Chicago reported that business-lending standards remained tighter than earlier in the year.  In Atlanta, there were expectations that third- and fourth-quarter credit losses would rise.  San Francisco reported that credit quality was generally good, but there was some tightening of credit conditions for commercial real estate lending.  Lending standards were generally unchanged in Kansas City.  In Philadelphia, credit quality for both business and personal loan portfolios has been steady.
Petroleum-based input prices rose recently, but strong competition has reportedly prevented many firms from passing on much of the cost increases to customers, except in transportation and certain other areas.  Rising costs resulted in increased pressure on profitability for firms in the Atlanta, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts.  Price pressures had reportedly diminished somewhat in New York, and with the exception of energy, most prices were stable in Dallas.  Cleveland, Kansas City, and Atlanta reported declining building materials prices, such as lumber and drywall.  Strong import competition has been keeping prices flat in San Francisco.  In contrast, Boston noted that some manufacturers were passing on more of their increasing costs to customers than in previous reports.  The increasing cost of health and other insurance programs continued to be reported as a concern in Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Chicago.
