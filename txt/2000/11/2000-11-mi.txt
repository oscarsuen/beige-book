The Ninth District economy continues to grow at a moderate pace. The growth for consumer spending remains slower, as well as for the construction, tourism and manufacturing industries. Meanwhile, energy and mining activity continues at a strong rate. Although some signs of weakness persist, most district farmers are having a good harvest and the expected government aid is larger than last year. Labor markets are still tight as businesses struggle to attract and retain workers. Overall price increases are moderate, but significant increases were noted for energy and employee benefits.
Homebuilding remains soft. Housing units authorized are down 10 percent in the district for the three-month period ending in August compared with a year earlier. A building official near Butte, Mont., reports slow home construction compared with a year ago, and a Minneapolis-St. Paul area mortgage consultant reports that mortgage activity has dropped compared with a year earlier.
Late summer tourism finished down in several parts of the district, while the number of fall travelers is on par with a year ago. Tourism at many areas of the Black Hills of South Dakota this summer was down 10 percent compared with last year, while visits to Glacier and Yellowstone national parks in Montana were down 8 percent and 14 percent respectively in August compared with last year. The number of travelers to northern Wisconsin this fall is about the same as last year, according to a Chamber of Commerce representative, and the number of visitors to the Duluth, Minn., area was up about 6 percent during September compared with a year ago, according to a tourism official.
Labor markets remain tight despite layoffs reported by some district companies; most are due to restructuring. A paper company is eliminating 700 jobs in Wisconsin and Minnesota, a Minneapolis area-based direct-marketer is cutting 550 workers, and a Minnesota health care product company plans to eliminate 260 jobs.
Wages continue to rise at a moderate pace. The September St. Cloud State University business survey reveals that 54 percent of respondents expect higher employee compensation at their companies over the next six months. Employees in the lower-wage range are quick to change jobs for modest pay increases, according to a member of the Minneapolis Fed's advisory council on small business, agriculture and labor from Eau Claire, Wis.
Large price increases are reported in energy and employee benefits, while overall price increases remain modest. A Minnesota-based utility said that its natural gas customers could face heating bills that are 35 percent to 50 percent higher than last winter, while Montana Power Co. is seeking a 12 percent increase in electric rates and a 9 percent increase in natural gas rates. Health insurance rates for St. Paul public school teachers are up about 15 percent over last year. Regarding overall price increases, the St. Cloud State University survey shows that 63 percent of respondents reported no change or a decrease in prices received for their products in September compared with three months ago, up from 56 percent of respondents in the June survey.
