In late September and early October, Eleventh District economic activity was at a high level, but grew at a slower rate than reported in the last Beige Book. Many contacts had become less optimistic about the outlook. Manufacturing activity slowed, retail and auto sales were slower than expected, and there were signs of cooling in the service sector and construction. Energy activity strengthened, however, and construction activity and demand for business services was strong. The financial industry reported no change in loan demand, but activity was slower than a year ago and institutions have increased their lending standards. Recent rains brought much needed water for livestock and improved soil moisture but were too late to help most crops.
Many manufacturers reported weaker demand than a few weeks ago and, as a result, prices were falling or expected to fall, despite higher fuel costs. Petrochemical producers said they are still unable to pass on higher production costs to their customers. Excess capacity and slack demand have led to falling prices for key products like ethylene, propylene and polypropylene. Paper producers reported large inventories as a result of slower than expected demand, and many companies have taken extra maintenance downtime to try to prevent overproduction. Prices for paper products remained unchanged, but one contact said that they are "on the verge" of price declines. Cement and concrete inventories are back to normal after shortages earlier in the year. Concrete and cement prices are expected to fall as new capacity comes online and have "plummeted" in Houston, where imports have increased competitive pressures. Selling prices for lumber and wood products declined; in some areas the price of plywood fell by as much as 25 percent and lumber by as much as 35 percent since their peak. Wood prices are expected to continue to decline because demand has fallen and supplies are high. Retailers said selling prices continued to be mostly unchanged despite some increased cost pressures, such as from transportation and energy. Most contacts say labor markets remain very tight, leading to increased overtime and rising wages. Some contacts, however, reported a loosening in the labor market. For example, in the high tech industry, while the labor market remains tight, the shake-up of Internet-related companies has freed up some high-skilled workers.
