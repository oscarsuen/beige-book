Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicate continued solid expansion in most industries in the recent survey period, although there were signs of moderation in some sectors.  District retailers reported moderate sales volumes and modest sales growth, while service providers noted continued strong demand for most products.  Manufacturers reported solid sales growth overall, boosted by strong demand for a variety of high-tech products.  Agricultural producers reported mixed conditions with weak demand and low prices for District farmers and strong demand and firm prices for District ranchers.  Commercial and residential real estate markets remained solid in most District states.  Throughout the District, employees at all skill levels remained in short supply, creating notable upward pressure on wages.  However, apart from fuel and energy, contacts noted that wholesale and retail prices remained stable.
Conditions among District service providers remained strong in recent weeks; however, there were signs of slowing among Internet service providers, as concerns about profitability and financing resulted in job cuts and business restructuring, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.  Demand for freight transportation remained brisk; in California, port traffic surged with notable increases in shipments to China.  In the tourism sector, growth in visitor traffic to Hawaii boosted hotel occupancy rates and room prices.  In contrast, in Salt Lake City, hotel occupancy rates continued to decline, due largely to increases in capacity.  The addition of capacity among movie theater chains has pushed occupancy rates down and begun to temper profits, despite strong growth in ticket sales.
District energy producers reported continued expansion of production; however, material and labor shortages have restrained growth.  Contacts reported difficulty obtaining pipe, gas turbines, and access to land.  Demand for geologists, engineers, and rig crews is strong, and experienced workers are in short supply.
Commercial real estate and construction activity remained strong in most District states, with the exception of Oregon.  Industrial and office vacancy rates declined throughout California, pushing lease rates up in most areas.  Vacancies remain at all time lows in the San Francisco Bay Area and have come down considerably in downtown Los Angeles.  While Washington's commercial real estate market remains tight, office vacancy rates reportedly inched up recently, due in part to declining demand from Internet-related firms.
