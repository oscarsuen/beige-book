Growth in economic activity in the Fourth District has slowed recently, particularly in durable goods industries, which are vulnerable to the strong dollar abroad.  Prices are stable for most goods except for fuel prices, which are rising, and the price of steel, which is falling.
The demand for most categories of temporary workers has declined since the summer, and contacts do not expect demand to increase by year's end.  Even so, administrative secretaries remain difficult to find.  Banks and trucking firms reported difficulty in finding and hiring qualified permanent employees. In the retail sector, store clerks are expected to be in especially high demand during the holidays.  Union contacts reported strong wage increases in companies that have experienced large growth.  In other companies, particularly those in which workers could be replaced with machinery or low-skilled labor, unions are seeing only modest wage increases.
Although commercial building activity is not growing as briskly as it was at the beginning of the year, it continues at a fairly steady and high level. However, construction for the retail trade industry has grown, while office and hotel building has declined.  Contacts reported difficulty in finding high-skilled trade workers, although the scarcity seems to have abated in the last two months. Prices have fallen slightly for many materials and noticeably for drywall.
Auto dealers that reduced the price of new autos because of manufacturers' incentives saw steady sales for the last six weeks, while those who did not have suffered declines of up to 10 percent.   Despite this, overall auto sales are only slightly below last year's record levels.  Used cars are also selling at a steady pace, although used-car inventories are at a high level.  In spite of high gasoline prices, consumers are still buying light trucks and larger autos.
