Firms continue to locate their distribution centers in the District because of its central location and its access to the hubs of the major package delivery firms.  For example, in September, Wal-Mart will begin building a regional distribution center in Missouri, creating 600 jobs; two other distribution centers in Louisville, now under construction, will create several hundred jobs by year-end.  A number of other companies, including several Internet companies, are also expanding and moving into the District.  Three e-commerce companies, for example, have recently moved into the Louisville and Memphis regions, creating more than 1,000 jobs.  Continued strength in financial markets is leading a St. Louis brokerage house to further expand its headquarters and add 550 new jobs.
A major problem for a variety of firms continues to be labor shortages, as District states continue to post some of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.  Contacts note that starting wages for entry-level positions are, in some cases, upwards of $8 or $9 an hour.  Signing bonuses at many firms are becoming larger for both skilled and unskilled workers.  For example, UPS is offering its largest bonuses ever to package sorters who stay on the job one year, and nurses in some parts of the District are receiving $2,000 signing bonuses.  In an effort to recruit and retain new hires, some fast food chains are offering free meals, regular pay raises, paid training, and profit sharing.  Overall, however, labor cost increases are reportedly moderate.
Attempting to consolidate their operations, some firms have closed their less-profitable locations.  A shoe manufacturer and a department store in Missouri will close a plant and an administrative office, respectively, eliminating a total of 340 jobs.  District employment in both the textile and the electronic equipment industries continues to decline.
Monthly residential building permits in June are down from May in most District metropolitan areas; year-to-date permits are down from a year earlier.  Despite the slowdown, builders are still experiencing relatively strong demand for homes.  Builders believe that high consumer confidence is helping to soften the effect of costlier mortgages somewhat.  In the St. Louis region, however, a strike by Teamster drivers of concrete trucks that started in late June has either slowed or halted many projects, especially commercial projects.  Some believe the strike could last another eight weeks.
According to a recent survey of large banks in the District, total loans outstanding are up almost 2 percent since late April.  Both the real estate and commercial and industrial loan categories are up more than 2 percent over the period; consumer loans, though, are down almost 3 percent.  Total deposits at these banks are down more than 4 percent over the same period.
Since the June report, rainfall in northern parts of the District has returned topsoil moisture to adequate levels; in southern parts of the District, however, the topsoil remains moderately dry.  Dry weather has also affected pasture conditions in Tennessee and Mississippi, where summer pastures and grass hay fields are becoming less productive and are reportedly in poor-to-fair condition.  The corn, rice, cotton, and soybean crops are generally in good-to-excellent condition District-wide; however, in Arkansas and Mississippi, soybeans are in only fair-to-good condition.
