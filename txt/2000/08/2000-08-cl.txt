Demand for temporary workers has eased from the high levels of last quarter, consistent with a typical seasonal slowdown. Demand decreased most for manufacturing positions but increased slightly for clerical workers. The overall supply of workers has increased due to the seasonal availability of students. Agencies currently see no need to increase wages. Increasingly, firms are hiring higher-skilled workers from the temporary agencies in hopes of finding permanent employees.  All contacts expect demand for labor to increase steadily through the end of the year, with the market becoming especially tight when college students return to school in the fall.
In contrast, contacts within the retail sector continue to experience difficulty in finding qualified employees, especially in middle management. Manufacturers in the District report difficulty in finding skilled employees, especially in information technology.  The rate of union wage growth is slightly higher than it was at this time last year.
District home builders report a slowing in the pace of demand--one builder noted a year-over-year decline in sales of 14 percent for the second quarter. Builders expect lower sales activity to persist for the foreseeable future. Declining prices for homes have cut into builders' profits.
Prices for materials remain generally flat. Bricks remain in short supply in the region. Labor market conditions in commercial construction remain tight; however, several residential construction firms reported laying off substantial proportions of their workforces--in some cases, as much as 20 percent to 30 percent.
Despite higher fuel prices, transportation and shipping companies across the District report increased business relative to a year ago. One contact reported a 7 to 8 percent year-over-year increase in volume in the second quarter of 2000. Some firms report that they have passed some of the increases on to their customers as temporary fuel surcharges. As in other sectors of the economy, firms involved in transportation and shipping indicate a persistent inability to secure qualified workers. One contractor told of being understaffed for the last five years.
Automobile dealers report that sales of new cars in June were even stronger than last year's record volume. July was slower, however, when compared to June or to the record sales of July 1999. Dealers attributed the softer July sales to three factors: higher interest rates, higher gasoline prices, and higher lease prices. They also report steady used car sales. Some dealers said that customers are opting for used cars because of rising interest rates and lease payments. Most dealers believe that sales will be steady, only slightly off from last year's high levels.
