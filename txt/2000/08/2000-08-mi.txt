Economic activity in the Ninth District is steady. Manufacturing, energy, and platinum mining activity is at about the level last reported, while growth in consumer spending has softened. Meanwhile, summer tourism shows signs of strength, and commercial construction continues at a robust pace. In agriculture, while overall crop growing conditions are good, crop prices remain low. Labor markets are still tight as businesses continue to report wage pressures, and some price increases are noted, primarily in housing and natural gas.
Homebuilding activity is slightly softer since the last report. District housing units authorized were down 6 percent for the three-month period ending in June compared with a year earlier. Nevertheless, a Minneapolis/St. Paul builders association representative foresees homebuilding finishing this year above the robust levels averaged in 1999. Demand for new apartment developments is strong in the Minneapolis area as apartment vacancy rates are below 2 percent, according to a real estate firm. Residential construction is stronger than last year in Sioux Falls, S.D., according to a chamber of commerce representative.
Meanwhile, District oil exploration and production continue at a strong pace in response to high petroleum prices. As a result, North Dakota mining and oil extraction taxable sales and purchases were up 45 percent in the first quarter of 2000 compared with year-earlier levels, although this represents only 0.4 percent of total North Dakota taxable sales and purchases.
Meanwhile, cattle producers are gaining from strong prices and low feed costs. However, higher fuel costs and drought conditions in central Montana are tempering rancher enthusiasm. The USDA reports topsoil moisture as short or very short for 75 percent of Montana. Some central Montana ranchers are culling cows, according to a bank director.
Most tourism officials and businesses claim that higher gasoline prices have not hampered tourism activity. Glacier National Park has had more visitors this year than last year at this time, and Montana hotel operators expect a good season. A tourism official in the Upper Peninsula expects a 5 percent increase for the summer compared with a year ago. In contrast, hotel occupancy in South Dakota was down 3 percent for June compared with a year earlier, and visits to Mount Rushmore were off 5 percent.
Employers continue to increase wages. According to an informal survey of manufacturers in the Dakotas, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, about 50 percent of respondents have increased wages about 2 percent to 5 percent to retain and attract workers. Teachers in South Dakota on average received a 7 percent hike in pay compared with a year ago. Some major Minnesota law firms are paying new associates salaries 14 percent to 35 percent higher than last year.
Some price increases are noted, especially in housing and natural gas. According to an informal survey of manufacturers in the Dakotas, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, about 35 percent of respondents expect to increase product prices about 2 percent to 5 percent. About 42 percent of respondents to the June St. Cloud State University survey expect to raise prices over the next six months, verses 32 percent in March. Apartment rental rates in the Minneapolis area are up over 10 percent compared with last year. Residential natural gas costs increased almost 6 percent in June compared with a year ago.
