Commercial real estate markets remained robust across the Southeast.  Occupancies and absorption were described as healthy.  Office space remained scarce in several markets, with speculative development continuing but at a slightly slower pace than previously.  Lenders are becoming more cautious and are requiring higher levels of pre-leasing.  Industrial markets remained tight across most of the region as firms continue to move into the District.  The overall outlook is for balanced growth through the remainder of the year, with little risk of a serious downturn.
Prices remained stable, with the usual exceptions.  Most contacts reported that price increases have been minor outside of energy and health care; however, prices are rising for products linked to oil, such as plastics and resin.  Shipping costs have been increasing as firms pass on higher fuel prices.  Health care insurance premiums and pharmaceutical prices continued to escalate at double-digit rates.
