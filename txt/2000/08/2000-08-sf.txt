In regard to prices, increased fuel and energy prices reportedly have begun to affect production costs in a wide variety of industries.  Sharp increases in electricity prices over the past several months have raised direct operating expenses for many manufacturers and retailers.  Higher fuel prices have boosted shipping costs, and increased prices for petroleum-based products, such as plastic bags and containers, have raised packaging costs.  However, contacts noted that, with a few exceptions, competitive pressure has prevented producers from passing increased costs on to consumers.  Although spared the indirect costs of rising energy prices, some District consumers are paying higher prices for electricity.  In San Diego, for example, the retail price of electricity doubled in recent months.
In the services sector, demand for District telecommunications, transportation, and tourism services remained high.  Respondents reported that demand for telecommunications and Internet-related services picked up; container traffic through the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles remained brisk; and visitor arrivals to Hawaii from the United States accelerated during the recent survey period, increasing hotel occupancy rates and room prices.
