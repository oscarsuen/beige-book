Third District business activity was mostly steady in July.  Manufacturers reported a slight increase in shipments but a level pace of new orders.  Retail sales in  June and July were even with the same period a year ago, but sales of motor vehicles have edged down.  Although overall retail sales were weaker than expected by many of the region's merchants, tourism activity has been brisk in the District, and spending on travel and recreation activities has been high.  Bank lending continued to rise, on balance, but growth in business loans has slowed and real estate lending has slipped.
Looking ahead, most of the business contacts surveyed for this report expect growth to pick up from July's pace but continue at a slower rate than in the first half of the year.  Manufacturers forecast modest gains in shipments and new orders.  Retailers expect sales to rise for the back-to-school shopping period.  Bankers anticipate continued but slower growth in overall lending, although they expect a further decline in real estate lending.
The consensus among the region's manufacturers is that business will pick up modestly in the second half of the year.  On balance, they forecast increases in orders and shipments, but they expect steady order backlogs and decreasing delivery times.  Surveyed firms anticipate the upward trend in input costs will persist, but the number of firms that plan to raise the prices of their own products remains small.
Sales of automobiles and light trucks slowed in July, according to dealers in the region.  Dealers said their inventories have increased, but they are not much above desired levels.  Manufacturers continue to offer extensive rebates and incentive financing.
Concern for credit quality appears to be growing.  Several bank credit officers noted that the percentage of borrowers that were slow in making loan payments has increased among both consumers and businesses.  Additionally, some bankers said that their business borrowers were falling further behind their revenue and profit goals.  These shortfalls may lead to credit reviews.
Several banks indicated that deposit growth has failed to meet their plans for the year.  Some banks said that even with slowing growth in loans, they still have had difficulty obtaining the deposits they require to meet their needs.  Bankers said they have been facing growing competition for personal deposit accounts from brokerage firms and mutual funds.
Looking ahead, bankers in the District expect slow growth in lending, overall.  Although most expect economic conditions in the region to remain good, they anticipate some slowing in business expansion.  They forecast an easing from the current rate of growth in business loans and a decline in commercial and residential real estate lending.  They expect current trends in consumer lending to continue, with rising credit card lending but no growth in other types of consumer loans.
