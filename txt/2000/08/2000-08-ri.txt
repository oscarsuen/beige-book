Manufacturers reported that the prices they received continued to rise modestly in July, and that the prices they pay for raw materials continued to increase moderately. Higher oil prices again squeezed profits for some District manufacturers; a chemical manufacturer in South Carolina, for example, noted that higher oil prices had increased raw materials prices, pushing his profits lower in the first two quarters of 2000. In addition, a manufacturer of precision instruments in Maryland reported that a shortage of electronic components used in digital telephones and pagers had lowered his profit margins.
In commercial markets, realtors reported continued tight supplies of Class A office space, but more abundant retail space in June and July. In the District of Columbia, speculative office buildings were generally fully leased by the time they were completed, and rents on office space were rising--exceeding $50 per square foot in some areas. In contrast, there was a slight decline in retail leasing activity in the District of Columbia and in the Carolinas. A Charlotte, N.C., realtor said there was now "a sense of overbuilding of retail space and apartments in the region." In Greenville, S.C., retail and office leasing activity was described as slowing, but rent levels were unaffected. In contrast, a realtor in Richmond, Va., said that the vacancy rate for retail space had declined dramatically and that he expected rents to rise during the next six months.
