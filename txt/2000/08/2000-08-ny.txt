Growth in the Second District's economy appears to have moderated since the last report.  While real estate prices and energy costs have risen sharply, inflation outside these categories remains subdued.  Labor shortages appear to be driving up wages of office and construction workers; however, manufacturing and retail wage increases have been moderate.  Most retailers indicate that sales were below plan in July, with unseasonably cool weather accounting for some but not all of the weakness.
Home construction activity, sales volume, and buyer traffic have slowed from their extraordinary first-quarter pace.  In contrast, the shortage of office space in New York City has become increasingly acute, with demand described as "unprecedented"--Manhattan office rents jumped 15 percent during the second quarter.  Regional purchasing managers report some pickup in manufacturing in July, along with a moderation in input price pressures.  Finally, bankers report continued weakness in loan demand, increasingly tight credit standards and further improvement in delinquency rates.
In terms of construction activity, recent trends are mixed.  On a seasonally-adjusted basis, multi-family permits in New York and New Jersey rose to a new cyclical high in the second quarter--up 31 percent from comparable 1999 levels, led by sharp gains in New York City, Westchester County, and metropolitan Buffalo.  In contrast, single-family permits weakened noticeably in the second quarter, and were down 7 percent from a year earlier in New York State and 11 percent in New Jersey.  Still, homebuilders in northern New Jersey indicate that plans for future construction remain strong, with the major constraints on the supply side (land and labor); they note that, despite any recent cooling in the market, they still cannot put up homes fast enough to meet demand.
Manhattan's office market grew increasingly tight in the second quarter, with demand described as "unprecedented."  Midtown's office availability rate fell to 3.2 percent at the end of June, down from 4.9 percent three months earlier.  Similarly, Downtown's rate fell to 5.4 percent from 6.9 percent.  At mid-year, Manhattan office rents were up roughly 25 percent from mid-1999 levels, having surged by roughly 15 percent during the second quarter alone.  Suburban markets, though considerably less frenetic, have also continued to strengthen: vacancy rates in Long Island, northern New Jersey, Westchester County, and Fairfield County are lower than a year ago, while rents on Class A properties are up by 5-10 percent.
Electricity costs for residents of New York City and the Lower Hudson Valley rose sharply in July--the average customer's bill is reported to be up 40 percent from a year earlier, despite unseasonably cool weather.  Most of the increase was attributed to a surge in fuel (natural gas) costs, as well as problems in bringing a major power plant on-line.
Regional purchasing managers' surveys indicate a pickup in the region's manufacturing sector in July, and some moderation in price pressures.  Buffalo purchasers report that both production activity and employment continued to grow at a moderate pace in July, while new orders turned up sharply, suggesting incipient strength.  Price pressures were slightly less widespread than in May and June.  Purchasing managers in the New York City area's manufacturing sector indicate that activity picked up sharply in July, after pausing in June, while those in other sectors were increasingly optimistic about both current conditions and the six-month outlook.  Prices paid were little changed in June and July, after rising for most of the past year.
Manhattan hotel occupancy rates remained at an exceptional 88 percent in June, while average room rates have accelerated in recent months and are up nearly 12 percent from a year ago.  Separately, Buffalo-area hotels report that occupancy rates have been running ahead of a year ago, while average room rates have risen 7 percent; bookings for July and August are also said to be looking strong.
