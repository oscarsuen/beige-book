The Tenth District economy held steady in March and early April, although there was some increased evidence of price pressures.  Retail sales were largely unchanged, manufacturing activity remained strong, and construction activity continued at a solid pace.  Activity in the energy sector was also stable after improving during much of the past year.  In the farm economy, the winter wheat crop was generally in good condition.  Labor markets remained very tight, with wage pressures slightly higher than in the recent past.  Price increases for manufacturing materials were more pervasive than in previous months.  Retail prices also continued to edge up, as did prices for certain construction materials.
