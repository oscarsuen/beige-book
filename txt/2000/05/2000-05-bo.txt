Business contacts in the First District               remain upbeat. Retailers indicate their sales are in line with expectations               and manufacturers report "solid" increases, with revenues or orders               for some sectors or products very strong. Average pay increases               remain in the 3 to 5 percent range, with larger increases for information               technology workers and increased use of a variety of performance-based               pay incentives for a wide range of professional and technical workers.               Except for oil-related products, both manufacturers and retailers               report little evidence of inflation. While a few manufacturers are               raising prices, materials costs and vendor prices are mostly flat               and large manufacturers continue to put pressure on their suppliers               for price reductions. Recent stock market shifts and interest rate               increases are said to be causing modest increases in uncertainty               about the outlook.
Retail respondents indicate that they plan very               little expansion of their operations over the next six months. On               the basis of the economy's currently strong fundamentals, most contacts               expect steady growth to continue through the year 2000. However,               in the furniture and apparel sectors, uncertainty has crept into               the outlook for the second half of calendar year 2000.
Materials costs are largely flat even though many               manufacturers are paying more for oil-based products, fuel, and               freight. Apart from energy, respondents report few instances of               higher quotes and generally they are pressuring their suppliers               to hold the line or offer more attractive terms. Manufacturers selling               building products, office supplies, plastics products, and selected               consumer items have raised prices in the range of 2 to 5 percent.               Selling prices are steady or down slightly in the case of information               technology companies and those manufacturing equipment related to               biotech and semiconductors. Firms making machinery and equipment               for the aircraft and automotive industries report continuing pressures               to reduce prices.
Except for a few firms that are expanding aggressively               to meet rapidly rising demand, most respondents report that employment               levels are flat or up slightly. Most employers report average annual               pay increases in the range of 3 to 5 percent. However, the average               increase is higher at IT firms, and respondents in a variety of               industries are reacting to very tight labor markets for professional               and technical employees by increasing signing bonuses, stock options,               promotion rates, and performance-based compensation. Other responses               to tight labor markets include contracting out more engineering               and software work (including overseas) and raising expenditures               on equipment and information systems.
Various manufacturers mentioned that sharp reductions               in stock prices or sharp increases in interest rates could adversely               affect the economic climate. However, respondents remain upbeat               about their revenue and earnings prospects absent large, unforeseen               shocks.
