Southeastern economic activity expanded moderately in early spring, and contacts are mostly optimistic about future prospects.  Merchants' sales have met or exceeded expectations, and retailers anticipate that second-quarter sales will better year-ago numbers.  Residential sales and construction have slowed in most markets, but commercial construction has picked up.  Although overall factory output has been soft recently, new contracts are aiding some producers.  Loan demand remains strong throughout the District except for housing, and the outlook for the tourism sector remains positive.  Labor costs are still under pressure because of continued labor scarcity throughout the District.  Contacts report increasing prices for a number of commodities and services.
Overall nonresidential construction picked up recently; however, activity has not been uniform across the District.  Construction reportedly rebounded strongly in Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee, while activity in Florida also improved from the first of the year but remained below year-ago levels.  Construction growth continued to accelerate in Alabama, while commercial construction slowed somewhat in Louisiana.
More contacts than before report increasing prices.  Stainless steel, copper, plastics, and lumber prices are increasing.  Newsprint and asphalt prices have also risen recently.  Many companies polled, from furniture movers and garbage haulers to air-freight firms, say that they are adding fuel surcharges to prices because of higher fuel costs.
