Reports from contacts indicated continued strong performance by the Twelfth District economy in recent weeks.  Labor markets were tight in most areas, and respondents reported increased upward pressure on wages and total compensation.  High oil prices led to increases in petroleum-based goods prices, as well as higher costs in the transportation and agriculture sectors.  In addition, some contacts noted increases in the price of natural gas at the wellhead and in the prices of paper-based goods.  Otherwise, materials costs and final product prices remained fairly stable.  District manufacturers, retail trade contacts, and service providers reported strong demand and no capacity constraints or material shortages.  Activity in real estate and construction markets remained vigorous, but growth slowed a bit in some areas during the most recent survey period.  Financial institutions reported strong loan demand and good credit quality.
High oil prices boosted prices for air, water, and ground transportation, gasoline, and some petroleum-based materials.  Respondents stated that some District shippers are passing increased trucking costs through to their customers in fuel surcharges.  One contact noted an increase in the price of natural gas at the wellhead, but this has not yet been passed through to consumers.  Contacts also cited increases in pulp and paper prices in recent weeks.
Beyond these items, materials costs and final goods prices remained fairly stable during recent weeks.  Contacts mentioned competitive pressures and increasing productivity as forces keeping prices from rising.  A contact from the high-tech sector reported decreases in the prices of microprocessors and some memory chips.
The commercial real estate market also is very strong in most areas of California.  Contacts in the state noted that rental space and construction labor were in short supply, and rents and construction costs increased.  Office rental rates in downtown Seattle increased, but construction of large, high-tech projects in Oregon slowed in recent weeks.
