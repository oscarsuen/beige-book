The Seventh District economy continued to expand in March and April, with some reports suggesting that growth may have slowed slightly.  Consumer spending remained strong, although some pockets of softness were reported.  Demand for new and existing homes eased modestly, although most contacts still described the housing market as healthy.  Production remained near capacity in some manufacturing sectors, but softness endured in other key industry segments.  Loan demand remained solid, and lenders reported that asset quality on both business and consumer loans was good overall.  Employers in the District again struggled to find and retain workers, and there were a few new reports of intensifying pressure on employment costs.  Dry soil conditions persisted in many areas, but spring planting proceeded at a rapid pace.
