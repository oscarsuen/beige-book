Business activity in the Third District             expanded moderately in March and April. Manufacturers posted increases             in shipments and orders. Retail sales of general merchandise were             slightly higher than during the same period last year. Auto sales             were solidly above the year-ago pace. Bankers reported slight increases             in loan volume outstanding compared to a year ago, with most of the             gain attributable to commercial and industrial loans. Firms in a variety             of industries continue to indicate that finding and retaining employees             is difficult. While skilled workers are most in demand in service             industries, some manufacturers and construction companies indicated             they have been unable to fill their needs for both unskilled and skilled             labor. Reports of rising prices have increased in both the industrial             and consumer sectors.
Looking ahead, most               business contacts in the Third District expect an easing in growth,               although retailers predict an improvement in sales. Manufacturers               forecast only steady rates of shipments and orders, on balance,               during the next six months. Retailers expect an upturn in sales               once the spring shopping period gets under way. Auto dealers foresee               a nearly steady rate of sales. Bankers anticipate slower growth               in business lending as a result of greater caution on the part of               lenders as well as borrowers. Bankers expect mortgage lending to               decline.
Third District manufacturers have trimmed their               forecasts recently. Earlier in the year they were predicting gains;               currently, the balance of opinion is that orders and production               will remain at about the current rate during the next two quarters.               Despite their forecast of steady business conditions, area manufacturers               expect prices of both the materials they purchase and the products               they make to remain on an upward trend.
Auto dealers indicated that sales have been strong               in recent weeks. Nearly all the dealers surveyed for this report               said sales in March and early April exceeded sales in the same period               a year ago by significant amounts. Extensive manufacturers' incentives               were said to be supporting the high rate of sales. Dealers indicated               that these incentives, in the form of rebates and low-rate financing,               were offsetting any effect that might have been expected from recent               increases in consumer loan rates at financial institutions. Dealers'               earlier concern about slow sales of new large sport utility vehicles               has receded as sales of those vehicles have risen recently. Dealers               foresee some slowing in sales during the rest of the year. They               expect sales for all of this year to decline a few percent from               last year's level.
Consumer lending was generally sluggish, with               most banks reporting flat to slightly declining loan volume outstanding               in March and April. The sluggishness in consumer lending extended               to credit cards, home equity loans, and indirect lending. Bankers               also reported that home mortgage refinancing activity has dropped               as mortgage interest rates have risen. In contrast, purchase money               mortgage lending has been rising, on balance, at banks in the region.
Commercial bank lending officers anticipate that               growth in business lending might ease as both lenders and borrowers               become more cautious about leverage ratios and debt service burdens.               However, bankers do not see any indications at this time of a slowdown               in business activity in the region. Financial institutions involved               in mortgage lending expect demand for purchase mortgages to slow               eventually in response to recent increases in interest rates. Some               banks that lend to builders and developers indicated that shortages               of construction labor and land approved for development appear to               be limiting the pace of home building in the region.
Retailers have also indicated that they are paying               more for some goods at the wholesale level. They have generally               avoided passing the full increase on to final selling prices, but               the combination of increases in the costs of some goods and rising               labor costs are leading a small but growing number of stores to               raise prices selectively.
