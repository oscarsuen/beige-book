Economic growth in the Ninth District remains steady. The energy and commercial real estate sectors continue to expand at a solid pace, although the growth of tourism and manufacturing as well as consumer spending remains slow. The financial condition of most district farmers is improving. Meanwhile, housing construction levels and iron mining production are decreasing. Labor markets are still tight, while wages are increasing at a moderate pace. Overall price increases are moderate, but significant increases are noted for energy, transportation and hotel room rates. Lumber prices are down significantly.
However, housing units authorized were down slightly in the district for the three-month period ending in October compared with a year earlier. Real estate loan demand is flat to down in several parts of North Dakota, said a bank director. In contrast, due to low rental property vacancy rates in Sioux Falls, S.D., 615 multifamily units were authorized during the first nine months of 2000, up from 218 units in 1999. The average sales price of a home in the Duluth, Minn., area, was up about 8 percent for the first nine months of 2000 compared with last year.
Fall tourism activity was down in some parts of the district, but many businesses are optimistic for the winter season. Fall travel in South Dakota and crossings at the International Bridge at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., in October were both down 10 percent compared with a year earlier. In contrast, fall travel and lodgings were solid in northern Wisconsin, according to a Chamber of Commerce official. Recent snowfall has resulted in earlier than normal openings for ski hills in South Dakota. A ski resort in northern Minnesota and another in Montana have opened on schedule and report bookings even and up 7 percent, respectively, compared with a year ago.
Wages are rising at a moderate pace. Hotel workers at two St. Paul hotels will receive 4 percent to 6 percent wage increases during the first year of a new contract. District manufacturing wages increased 2.9 percent for the three-month period ending in September, the lowest rate of increase in 16 months. In an informal survey of manufacturers in the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin, about 35 percent of respondents reported raising wages in October, down from 70 percent a year earlier.
Price increases were noted in energy, transportation and hotel room rates, with reductions in lumber. Heating costs in Montana are expected to increase as much as 40 percent compared with last year, and many retailers are now assessed a freight surcharge of 4 percent to 8 percent of published rates to meet higher fuel costs, reported a bank director. The average daily room rate for district hotels and motels increased 6.4 percent in September compared with a year earlier. In contrast, framing lumber prices dropped almost 25 percent from the beginning of the year. Only 27 percent of respondents reported increased product prices in an informal survey of manufacturers, down from 55 percent six months ago.
