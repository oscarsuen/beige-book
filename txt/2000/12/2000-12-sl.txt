District economic activity, though still operating at a high level,               has slowed somewhat over the past few weeks. Retail sales have been               weak, with nearly all contacts reporting sales growth below expectations.               Cautious optimism reigns among retailers this holiday season. Demand               and employment growth have moderated at District manufacturers and               other businesses. Still, many firms continue to struggle to fill               positions, especially seasonal positions. District home sales and               new construction are both down from their year-earlier levels, although               downward trends have been leveling off. Banks report mixed changes               in loan demand: an increase for commercial and industrial loans,               a decrease for real estate loans. Favorable weather has enabled               farmers to complete the harvest early. Corn and soybean yields are               up in most District states.
Car dealers report that sales, especially of used cars, have been weak over the past two months--down 5 to 10 percent on average over a year earlier.  Higher interest rates and a recent dip in consumer confidence have been cited as reasons.  Half of the contacts note that current inventories are at desired levels; the other half have inventories that are slightly overstocked.  Although expectations about sales for the rest of the year are mixed, more than half of the dealers are optimistic that sales will pick up in December.
Tight labor markets have made the search for holiday employees difficult.  Firms continue to use job fairs and offer retention bonuses and large employee discounts to attract and retain workers.  Some contacts report offering wages of $9 per hour for clerk and counter help.  Stores increasingly report attracting new workers, such as retirees, into the labor force to fill vacancies.
As with home sales, residential construction has continued to level off.  New building permits are down from a year earlier.  Nonresidential construction has also slowed, with some reports of more general contractors bidding on each job now than earlier this year.  A positive side effect of the general slowing in all construction is that material shortages are less frequent.  Backlogs of orders have also kept construction companies busy, with large projects continuing in many areas.
Surveys and reports indicate that this year's corn yields in all District states except Arkansas and Mississippi are well above last year's yields.  Soybean yields are also rising modestly in these states.  In Arkansas and Mississippi, on the other hand, both corn and soybean yields are below their year-earlier rates.  A contact in Kentucky reports that tobacco yields are above average and are exceeding producers' expectations.  Reports from contacts in several District states note that because some grain terminals are filled to capacity, they have had to temporarily store excess grain on the ground.
