Growth in economic activity in the Fourth District has slowed, even from the moderated rates of our last report.  Many manufacturing industries are showing their vulnerability to the strong dollar abroad.  Labor markets are much less tight, even among the highly skilled.  Retail spending is soft.
Temporary employment agencies reported mixed demand for workers.  Some firms need temporary help to finish contracted work by the end of the year.  Others have reduced their demand.  Firms are less likely now to change a temporary hire into a permanent employee. Retail store clerks, customer service representatives, and technical assistants are in high demand.  Temporary agencies reported that it is easier to find workers since the last report.
Union contracts averaged wage increases of about 3 percent.  Unions have been able to negotiate larger pension increases, particularly with companies whose pension programs are well funded.  The construction trades reported that shortages of skilled labor have disappeared, as firms have begun to lay off workers, such as pipe fitters and electricians, who have been previously kept on the payrolls as home building flattened out.
Heavy truck manufacturers continue to expect large cuts in production.  Fourth quarter truck orders stand at about forty percent of first quarter orders, even though this is a time of year when firms expect orders to be at their highest.  The high value of the dollar is also hurting other industries in the District, including chemical and paper producers.  Capital equipment manufacturers are suffering from a general decline in new orders.
Domestic auto manufacturers that reduced the price of new autos saw steady sales for the last six weeks, while those who did not have suffered declines of up to 15 percent.   Despite this, overall auto sales are only slightly lower than last year's record levels.  However, inventories are 25 percent higher than desired.  Sales of used vehicles were steady during October and November.  In spite of high gasoline prices, consumers are still buying light trucks and larger autos.
