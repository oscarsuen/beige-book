Reports from Twelfth District contacts indicate overall solid expansion in most states, although signs of slowing were apparent in some industries.  Better than expected holiday sales boosted overall sales growth among retailers and service providers in the District in recent weeks.  Manufacturers of aircraft and high-tech goods reported solid, but slower, sales growth, while producers of other manufactured goods noted a decline in demand, particularly from foreign buyers.  Conditions among District agricultural producers were mixed, as demand and prices improved for ranchers but remained weak for farmers.  District real estate and construction activity remained at high levels, due largely to a pickup in demand for home remodeling and ongoing strength in commercial real estate markets.  Credit demand in the District remained high in recent months, although some borrowers faced tighter terms for loans.  Respondents reported that energy and wage costs have continued to rise, but competitive have pressures prevented producers from passing increased costs on to consumers.
District contacts reported that increased job-hopping by employees has begun to affect compensation practices.  One contact noted that signing and retention bonuses are being replaced by company cars and other perks that end when the employment relationship terminates.  Respondents noted that while labor, fuel, and energy costs have risen in recent months, competitive pressures, both domestic and foreign, have prevented most producers from raising the  prices of final goods and services.
Service industry respondents in most District states reported strong growth in recent weeks.  Demand for telecommunications (cell phones), data communications (DSL), and cable television remained robust, lengthening the time to service in a number of areas.  Despite the dot-com shakeout, demand for software and information processing services remained intense, and computer services workers were in short supply.  Growth in demand for warehouse and distribution services picked up in recent months, as retailers prepared for the holiday selling season.  In California and Hawaii, strong demand for hotels pushed occupancy rates up and boosted room prices.
