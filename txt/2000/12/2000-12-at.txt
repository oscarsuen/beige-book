The District economy continued to expand               at a moderate rate during November, largely matching the slower               pace noted in the last report. The outlook is for a continuation               of slower growth through the remainder of the year. Retailers' reports               were generally subdued, with warm weather stalling apparel sales               in many parts of the region, while larger automobiles and sport-utility               vehicles were selling more slowly than a year ago. Growth in Thanksgiving               retail sales appeared to be strong, particularly at discount stores.               New residential and nonresidential construction and sales continued               to soften in the District. Factory activity also slowed, but some               new projects were announced in the transportation equipment sector.               Reports from the tourism and hospitality industry were more positive               than in our last report. Loan activity remained strong but was expected               to slow in the near term. Labor market pressures eased slightly,               while reports of price increases remained limited.
Nonresidential construction also slowed, continuing               a trend from the third quarter. Office vacancy rates rose moderately               in several key markets, although net absorption continued to be               strong in most areas. Industrial vacancy rates fell in some markets.               Multifamily construction continued to slow, with several locations               experiencing higher vacancy rates. Reports continued to indicate               little near-term risk of oversaturation in the commercial real estate               market. Overall District construction employment payrolls in October               were estimated to be around 1.5 percent higher than a year ago,               which was the slowest annual growth since 1992.
Reports of price increases were more frequent               than in our last report, but limited to certain sectors. Some contacts               mentioned increasing prices for industrial commodities such as copper               and aluminum. Higher fuel prices have caused problems for local               truck manufacturers and transportation firms. Health care costs               continued to increase throughout the District, while lumber and               paper prices were down notably. A few reports noted accelerating               wage growth.
