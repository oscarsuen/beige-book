The Fifth District economy expanded at a more moderate pace in late October and November, though the level of economic activity remained high. Retail sales growth tapered off during much of November, but regained momentum after Thanksgiving. Services firms reported somewhat slower growth in demand and only modest employment growth. Manufacturing activity remained at a relatively strong level even though output was flat and raw materials prices moved higher. The real estate and financial sectors slowed in part because of recent stock market declines and uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election. District labor markets remained tight, and wage growth was modestly higher. Price increases remained moderate in the services sector and were little changed in manufacturing, despite a pick-up in raw materials prices in recent months.
On balance, commercial realtors reported an easing in leasing and construction activity in recent weeks. Realtors in the District of Columbia said that demand for office space had declined slightly, in part because of diminished demand from firms in the telecommunications industry. A realtor in Columbia, S.C., said that the local office and industrial markets had slowed but that the area's retail market remained strong. Contacts in Charlotte, N.C., indicated that retail and office leasing activity was expanding more slowly and that there was less speculative construction underway. On a stronger note, contacts in Richmond, Va., indicated that growth in retail leasing has been steady with a slight upward pressure on rental rates, and a Raleigh, N.C., realtor described markets in that area as "very healthy." Despite some signs of softening demand, the supply of Class A office space remained tight in most metropolitan areas of the District.
