The Seventh District economy continued to expand in recent weeks, although growth appeared to be slow.  Retail sales were higher than most merchants expected as the holiday shopping season began, but much of the strength seemed attributable to higher-than-normal promotional activity.  Sales of both new and existing homes remained relatively strong, yet softer than a year ago, and growth in nonresidential building activity slowed somewhat recently.  Manufacturing activity remained slower in recent weeks and the pricing environment was again very soft.  Labor markets were very tight, though there were some reports of lower demand for manufacturing workers.  District farmland values rose less than 1 percent during the third quarter.  Despite low commodity prices, farm debt continued to be serviced in a timely manner as government payments substantially augmented farm-derived income.
