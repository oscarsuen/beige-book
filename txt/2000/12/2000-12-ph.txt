Bankers in the Third District expect overall loan growth to remain slow for the balance of this year and well into next year.  Growth in business lending is expected to ease further.  Several bankers noted that they are reviewing their commercial loan pricing policies, and the review could lead to their signing fewer new loans.  Some banks also reported that their business borrowers were scaling back expansion plans and prospective borrowing needs.  Real estate lending could ease, as some banks indicated they intend to reduce their real estate exposure.  Most bankers expect consumer lending to rise further in the weeks ahead because of seasonal factors, and some anticipate that this credit category will be the most resilient next year as long as employment and household incomes do not weaken.
