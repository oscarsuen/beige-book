The Seventh District economy continued to expand moderately in January and February, while reports of intensifying pressure on wages and prices were isolated.  Confident consumers buoyed retail spending, with contacts reporting strong sales of electronics, home-related items, and light vehicles.  Business construction remained robust, and sales of both new and existing homes were stronger than expected.  Overall manufacturing activity was paced by strength in light vehicle and steel production, but pockets of weakness persisted.  Despite higher interest rates, lending activity remained brisk and credit quality was said to be improving.  In a familiar refrain, labor markets were very tight, shortages of workers persisted, and there were a few new reports of intensifying wage pressures.  District farmland values strengthened in late 1999 and were up 1 percent for the year.
