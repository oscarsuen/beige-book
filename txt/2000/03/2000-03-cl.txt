Growth in the District economy remains strong, with continued low rates of joblessness and steady wage growth.  Materials prices for manufacturers are rising.  However, the prices for consumer goods and the materials prices for construction are stable.
Union sources reported continued wage growth, averaging 3 per cent.  They affirmed that gains are "across-the-board" instead of being skewed by a few large settlements.  Pension funds have done well recently due to high stock market returns.  This has been balanced by a concern over the possibility that higher health care costs will be borne increasingly by workers and less by the firms.  Job security remains a high-priority issue in union negotiations.
Reports on the demand for information technology were mixed, depending on the type of services provided.  Contacts who experienced an upsurge last quarter due to Y2K-related consulting expect a slowdown.  Others anticipate a rise, as clients turn to development projects that were postponed until Y2K.
Commercial builders reported a large increase in publicly funded construction. They also reported an increase in the construction of industrial facilities and office buildings. This is driven, in part, by increased demand from the manufacturing sector.  Warehouse space for Web-based businesses is in high demand,. but retail space is characterized by some as being overbuilt. One contact suggested that the labor market was so tight that it could cause a wage increase on the order of 5 to 10 percent.  Finding subcontractors has also become very difficult due to the high demand for construction.
In general, materials prices for construction are flat.
In recent months the combination of strong demand and declining imports has caused steel prices to rise. Some companies announced spot market steel price increases of $20-$25 per ton for hot rolled, cold rolled, and coated products, effective for January shipments, and an additional $30 per ton effective for April shipments.  Demand continues to be strong.  However, last year's steel-price decreases and raw-material-price increases have caused most companies to report losses for 1999.  Some companies expect to see improvements this quarter, but others do not expect major improvements until the end of the second quarter of 2000.  Several companies have announced small job cuts recently.
Purchasing managers in the District reported an increase in the growth rate of commodity prices in January.  Higher prices were reported in primary metals, engineered polymers, memory chips, PVC resin, and steel.  After several months of reductions, inventories of raw materials are starting to be rebuilt.  Inventories of finished goods continue to drop.  Both production levels and new order levels were mixed, but more companies reported higher levels in January than lower.
Sales of new vehicles have generally slowed for the month of February.  However, sales in January were good, despite the bad weather.  The February slowdown was anticipated, and inventories, which had been reduced by the brisk holiday sales, are now at more normal levels.  Dealers did not believe that high gasoline prices would significantly affect sales, and they foresaw continued strong sales for the next few months.
Credit quality is thought to be high, as banks report being very selective in accepting loan applications.  Most banks already have a very high loan-to-deposit ratio both because of strong credit demand and because depositors are finding alternative instruments to bank liabilities. Willingness-to-lend levels remain high, but all banks reported that it is very difficult to attract deposits at rates that will provide a healthy margin for them.
The spread between borrowing and lending rates is shrinking due to competition. Small banks reported that bigger banks toughen the competition by offering lower rates.
