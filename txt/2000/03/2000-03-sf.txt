Contacts reported strong performance by the Twelfth District economy in recent weeks, characterized by generally robust demand for final products and labor inputs.  Although some wage pressures were evident, prices for final goods and most services have remained fairly stable, in part due to vigorous competition in the retail trade sector.  District manufacturers reported strong demand, including some increases in export demand, although aircraft deliveries continued to decline.  In addition, contacts saw few signs of capacity constraints in manufacturing.  Agricultural conditions were mixed.  Activity in the construction and real estate markets remained strong in many parts of the District, although slowing was reported in a few states.  Financial institutions reported strong demand for credit and adequate liquidity.
