Tenth District economic activity remained solid in January and early February.  Retail sales stayed strong after the holidays, manufacturing activity held steady, and construction activity was largely unchanged despite some further slowing in home sales.  Activity in the energy sector was also stable following recent growth.  In the farm economy, dry weather hurt the winter wheat crop but recent rains should help soil moisture levels.  Labor markets remained very tight, although wage pressures were not quite as high as in the recent past.  Some retail prices edged up, and prices for several construction and manufacturing materials continued to rise.
