As spring approaches, the Ninth District             economy continues to look very strong. Construction, manufacturing             and consumer spending remain robust, energy and iron mining are making             a rebound, and even agriculture shows some signs of improvement. Of             the major industries, only tourism exhibits little growth. The economic             strength continues to be reflected in labor markets, which remain             tight, and with businesses reporting some wage pressures. However,             while input prices have been rising, there are still few signs of             accelerating inflation.
Residential construction is also strong. Due to               low vacancy rates, the outlook for Minneapolis/St. Paul apartment               building is promising, according to a commercial real estate firm.               Rental rates are up about 10 percent in the Minneapolis/St. Paul               area compared to a year earlier. Home prices finished 1999 up 5               percent to 9 percent compared to a year earlier for several district               cities, including a 9.3 percent climb in Minneapolis/St. Paul. District               housing units authorized in 1999 finished with the second highest               fourth quarter of the decade.
Tourism is expected to finish flat overall, with               gains in areas with normal or above normal snowfall, and losses               where snowfall came late in the season. A ski area in northern Montana               reports excellent snow conditions and a 35 percent increase in business               compared to last year. In contrast, tourism businesses in parts               of Minnesota with light snow cover are concerned. Below normal snowfall               in South Dakota has stifled winter sports. "We would have a lot               more business if we had more snow," says a tourism official.
Meanwhile, Ninth District oil exploration has               increased as oil prices have risen. In February, nine rigs were               operating in North Dakota compared to one a year ago. In addition,               estimated February oil production in North Dakota was up 5 percent               from year-ago levels. However, in Montana only three rigs were operating               compared to five a year ago and Montana oil production is down 9               percent from a year ago.
Looking ahead, a continued warm winter has farmers               worried about lack of snow coverage for winter grains and a possible               drought next summer as a result of dry soil conditions. Moreover,               some ranchers tell of problems getting water to their animals, but               the mild winter continues to reduce stress on livestock.
Companies are still looking for workers. A telecommunications               company based in Superior, Wis., will add more than 300 jobs by               early March. A major electronics retailer based in Minneapolis/St.               Paul recently announced plans to add 2,000 workers at its headquarters               over the next five years.
Wages continue to creep higher. An informal survey               of Upper Midwest businesses conducted in January reports that wages               are generally about 2 percent to 4 percent higher than last year.               A major Minneapolis/St. Paul-based airline increased the bonus pay               to mechanics with specialized licenses by $1.50 an hour; custodians               and cleaners received $500 bonuses. A Fargo, N.D., hospital is offering               $4,000 signing bonuses for registered nurses.
While overall prices are not accelerating, input               prices and transportation costs are increasing. Surveys of manufacturers               show that input prices are higher compared to a year earlier. The               Creighton University survey reports that an index of input prices               for January in Minnesota and South Dakota is almost twice as high               as a year ago. Through January, the Upper Midwest business survey               reports that an average of 41 percent of respondents over the past               five months have reported higher input prices compared to 22 percent               for the first eight months of 1999. Rising oil prices have affected               transportation costs, but businesses aren't showing noticeable concern.
