Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated appreciable expansion of economic activity during late January and February.  The majority of districts reported strong growth during the survey period, with the remaining reports pointing to moderate growth or continued high levels of activity.  Retail sales expanded significantly over their year-earlier levels.  Gains in manufacturing output were widespread.  Providers of services to businesses and consumers continued to expand output and employment substantially.  Real estate market activity and construction were at high levels, although slight cooling was evident in some areas.  Conditions in the agricultural and resource extraction sectors were mixed.  Demand for bank loans generally was strong, but several districts reported slower activity in some loan categories, especially consumer loans and residential mortgages.
Constraints on the availability of labor and other production inputs were apparent in many areas.  Most districts reported tight supplies and upward wage pressure for various types of labor, both skilled and entry level.  Despite faster wage growth for some workers, increases in the prices of final goods and services were limited overall, although the prices of transportation services and some industrial commodities rose noticeably.
Residential construction activity and sales of new homes remained strong in many areas, although several reports cited evidence of slowing compared with 1999.  Recent levels of construction and sales activity were near historical highs in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts, and they also have remained high in California, where home prices have been rising rapidly.  However, signs of cooling in residential real estate markets have emerged in the Atlanta and Kansas City Districts and in several states in the San Francisco District.
Despite the recent sharp increase in the price of crude oil, conditions in the resource extraction industry were mixed.  Oil drilling and extraction activity increased in several districts, but they were "lackluster" in Dallas, where companies have been choosing to pay down debt rather than risk expansion.  In Minneapolis, mining of iron ore picked up further in response to strong demand, but gold mining remained weak.
Prices of some industrial commodities rose noticeably, especially                 for energy and petroleum-related products. Rising wages and fuel                 costs have raised prices and reduced profit margins for providers                 of transportation services, especially trucking. Other commodity                 inputs and raw materials with noticeable price increases included                 steel, primary metals, building materials, and computer memory                 chips in the industrial sector and chemicals and fertilizers in                 the agricultural sector. However, increases in the prices of final                 goods and services reportedly were limited overall.
