Contacts in the Southeast indicate that the District economy continues to expand at a robust pace and the outlook remains positive.  Retail sales have been strong, although growth has eased slightly recently.  District builders said that the pace of single-family construction in January was below a year ago, while nonresidential District construction has tailed off in some areas.  Factory production and new orders have slowed, but contacts expect manufacturing activity to improve in the near term.  Despite continued weakness in some business sectors, overall loan demand remains high, and the outlook for the tourism and hospitality sector is mostly upbeat.  Tight labor markets continue to negatively affect the District, and there were scattered reports of accelerating wages.
Nonresidential construction continued to decline overall.  However, activity has not been uniform across the District.  Construction accelerated in Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee, whereas activity slowed somewhat in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi.  Speculative construction continues in several markets, but experts are cautioning that demand for office and retail space in particular will probably wane somewhat this year.
More contacts than previously noted increasing prices.  District farmers are particularly concerned about rising oil prices, which have boosted prices for fertilizer and some other petroleum-based raw materials.
