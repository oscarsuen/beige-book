Some signs of strength were evident in the Ninth District's economy at year's end. District consumer spending appeared to be reasonably strong in December. Most district states' unemployment rates have stabilized, and some new, resource-based employment is opening up in the hard-pressed northern areas of Minnesota and Michigan. Late in the year, crop prices picked up slightly, but not nearly enough to significantly alleviate the district's rural economic problems.
District sales of motor vehicles, which were strong throughout 1985, finished the year on an uptick. The regional office of a domestic auto producer reports that its December sales were well above its goal. A Bank director from Montana notes that car sales there increased by 20 percent between 1984 and 1985. And a former Bank director from western Wisconsin reports that an auto dealership in that area had its second-best year in 40 years.
Spurred by lower mortgage rates, housing activity in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area was vigorous at year's end. During November, housing permits taken out in the Twin Cities were far greater than a year earlier, as were December home sales in Minneapolis. This strong performance raised Minneapolis home sales 17 percentage points above the 1984 level.
Tourist spending, an important source of income in parts of the district, has been uneven this winter. Skiing in Montana was hurt by poor snow conditions, but early snowfalls in northern Minnesota stimulated both skiing and dogsled racing. A Bank director from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan says that snowmobilers there are spending lots of money pursuing their hobby.
Several noteworthy labor developments occurred in hard-pressed northeastern Minnesota. These include progress on plans to build a large paper mill employing 600 workers in Duluth; the possible reopening of a fiberboard insulation plant somewhere in the area; and the resumption of operations at two taconite plants that will return nearly 2,000 temporarily unemployed workers to their jobs.
