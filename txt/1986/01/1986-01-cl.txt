Area new-car dealers report strong sales following the typical holiday sales decline. Most auto dealers report the early January sales gains, in some cases as much as 30 percent above year-ago levels, are a consequence at the nationally sponsored interest-rate incentive programs. However, domestic new-car dealers have also noted a moderate improvement in nonqualifying sales categories, such as luxury new-car models. Few new-car dealers expect incentive-induced sales gains to last. Local new-car inventories increased in late-December and early-January, but area dealers note that this is typical as they prepare for the anticipated Spring sales increases.
There is still very little indication of response to dollar depreciation. Of eight major manufacturing firms that export and/or compete against imports, none report having been able to raise their own prices in response to dollar depreciation, only two report any increase in orders or sales, and the remaining six report having no additional inquiries.
Most steel producers continue to face weak prices and stiff competition as imports exceed levels envisioned by the import control program. Major producers have pruned their operations but more surgery may be needed unless price increases are obtained. Nevertheless, some segments of the industry, such as flat rolled steel used by the auto industry, and specialty steel, are doing well. A steel industry analyst expects domestic steel consumption to fall slightly in 1986, offsetting an expected small decline in imports and leaving domestic steel shipments unchanged.
Mortgage lending in the District remains strong, although it has softened in recent weeks because secondary market rates have climbed 65 to 70 basis points. One major mortgage lender's 1985 mortgage volume was up 50 percent on a year-to-year basis. Home loan refinancing represented 50 percent of their loan activity in December. The firm expects a 25 percent increase in its mortgage loan applications in 1986.
Realtors' transactions volume rose 10 percent above 1984 levels, bringing record profits in 1985. One major realtor expects another profit record in 1986. Although his new listings are showing signs of slowing, he plans to increase staff 10 percent in 1986.
A major builder in the District reports record 1985 earnings, despite a small drop in orders. This builder reports a recent surge in traffic, with fewer lookers and more serious buyers. There is little speculative house building, and pre-selling of homes has become a common practice among builders.
