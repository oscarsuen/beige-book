Compared with last year, retailers kept inventories more in line with sales and avoided more unplanned price markdowns. Most respondents reported profits similar to or slightly above 1984 levels.
Total deposits at large District banks grew at a 10.5 percent rate for the fourth quarter compared with a 12.1 percent rate recorded for the same period last year. This slower rate can be attributed to modest growth in MMDA's, which increased at one-half the rate recorded for fourth quarter 1984.
