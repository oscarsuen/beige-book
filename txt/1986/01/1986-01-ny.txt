Almost all sectors of the Second District economy experienced modest gains since the last report. Consumer spending during the Christmas season met most retailers' conservative expectations and inventories were generally at low levels going into the new year. Residential construction has continued strong, in part because of mild weather. In addition, the long-awaited pick-up in office leasing activity appears to have started in northern New Jersey. In contrast, reports are mixed about the strength of current business activity. Nonetheless, the outlook for early 1986 is generally viewed favorably. On the financial side, small District banks report a sharp rise in business loan demand.
In general, retailers avoided the inventory problems of last year that had necessitated substantial price-cutting to reduce stocks. Most merchants entered this holiday season with much lower inventories than a year earlier and maintained stocks close to planned levels throughout the period. Because they were able to stick to planned promotions and pricing policies, they anticipate higher profits than last year.
While office market conditions were generally stable, in northern New Jersey increased leasing activity and a slowing of new projects have taken some of the slack out of the market. In New York City, additional financial firms are expanding outside Manhattan. Citicorp proposed construction of an office complex in Queens that would be the largest ever built in the outer boroughs. At the same time, a second financial services firm has announced plans to locate some of its operations in an area now under development in Brooklyn.
Very few industrial developments of major significance have been announced recently. Of considerable concern in the Rochester area, however, is the likely impact of a recent court ruling that Eastman Kodak must terminate its instant photography business because of patent infringements. At the time of the ruling Kodak employed 800 full-time workers in that operation. Also, Avon announced cutbacks of almost 500 workers in the New York metropolitan area. On a more positive note, Piedmont Aviation plans to center its northeastern operations in the upstate New York communities of Utica and Syracuse. In the Buffalo area, a group of local investors recently completed the purchase of a metal-working firm, preserving almost 900 jobs.
The unemployment picture in the District remains relatively good. December unemployment rates were 6.3 percent in New York State and 5 percent in New Jersey, down slightly from November. For 1985 as a whole, unemployment in New York State was 6.5 percent and in New Jersey 5.7 percent, rates below the national average. These were also the lowest levels since the mid-1970s.
