This month's commentaries on regional economic activity suggest that the economy is growing at a moderate pace on balance. Several Banks, including Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, pointed to signs of improving business activity in their respective Districts. Most other Banks reported little change. Dallas reported that its economy remained sluggish, and St. Louis noted a continuation of the conflicting signals reported earlier for its region. Chicago pointed to continued weakness in its District and indicated that it expected business activity there to lag the national economy in 1986.
The economic picture is uneven across sectors. Consumer spending appears to have been moderately strong during the Christmas season in most regions, although Chicago reported that sales were disappointing. Construction activity was also reported to be relatively strong, especially in the residential sector. Manufacturing activity, however, is mixed, ranging from a boom in military electronics in the San Francisco District to activity that remains in the "doldrums" in time Cleveland District. Elsewhere, several reports noted continuing problems in agriculture, including declining livestock prices (Minneapolis and Dallas), rising delinquencies on farm loans (St. Louis), low orange prices (Atlanta), and low tobacco prices (Richmond). Several pockets of strength in the agricultural sector were mentioned, however, including poultry, almonds, and winegrapes.
Automobile sales have apparently responded to the latest round of interest rate incentive programs. Cleveland, for example, noted that sales in early January were up as such as 30 percent from year-ago levels. Dallas, however, reported that sales have recently weakened and that inventories of domestic cars were excessive.
There were mixed views of the outlook for consumer spending. While sales are generally expected to increase, some of the reports suggest the increase may be modest in some regions. For example, Kansas City reported that sales are expected to increase only slightly, and Philadelphia indicated that most retailers expect flat sales in the first half.
Atlanta and Sam Francisco reported that defense spending had stimulated industrial activity in their Districts, particularly in the electronic equipment and shipbuilding industries. Richmond and Atlanta reported that activity in the textile industry, hit hard in recent months by imports, had recently stabilized, albeit at a low level. Sam Francisco and Dallas stated that the output of lumber and wood products in their areas had continued to decline.
Several Banks noted little tangible response to the recent decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. Richmond, however, indicated that several District manufacturers had recently reported renewed contacts with former customers. Also, Boston reported that sales to European buyers had picked up quite markedly in the second half of 1985 due, at least in part, to the dollar's decline.
The reports on agriculture were not uniformly bleak, however. Richmond indicated that the demand for poultry was strong, and San Francisco found that the lower dollar had aided producers of almonds and winegrapes. Chicago and Minneapolis stated that recent increases in some farm commodity prices were a positive factor. Also, Kansas City reported that excellent crop yields and higher livestock prices had produced a better than expected farm loan situation.
