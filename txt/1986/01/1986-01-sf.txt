The forest products industries continue to suffer. The recent drop in the value of the dollar is unlikely to help forest products companies, because they compete primarily with Canada, whose dollar has remained stable vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, a recent survey of 60 Oregon forest products companies found that only three were unprofitable in 1985. Many of the profitable firms made only slim profits, however.
In Nevada, gold and silver mining activity is expanding. In 1985, 100 million ounces of gold were mined in Nevada, a 100 percent increase from 1984's total. Mining activity for other metals, such as copper, remains depressed.
