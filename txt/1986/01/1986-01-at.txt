The Southeast economy firmed up early this year, with strength in Georgia and Florida more than offsetting a stagnating Louisiana economy. District unemployment leveled off in October and November, partly due to late-year stability among textile and apparel jobs. Advances in single-family housing, industrial real estate development, and tourism bolstered the regional economy, while commercial construction imbalances and the farm sector weakened it. Slumping auto sales detracted from otherwise good consumer buying. Bank loan growth continued to slow.
Office construction continues to outpace leasing, even though incentives are liberally employed in most regional markets. Commercial developers cite uncertainty about future tax law changes as discouraging many investors. Rising vacancy rates are applying downward rent pressure in both Miami and New Orleans. But Atlanta real estate agents view the office market as strong in spite of its 16 percent vacancy figure. Retail construction is described as tentative in Orlando and Tampa, as new space is accumulating and leasing is sluggish. The Tampa and Nashville industrial markets seem set for expansion due to low vacancy rates and growing industrial bases locally.
