The Second District's economy improved somewhat in recent weeks. Department store sales were moderately higher than a year earlier, resulting in generally satisfactory inventory levels. A pickup in office leasing activity was noted in a number of areas, and homebuilding remained strong where weather permitted. Reports on business activity were mixed, however, and several manufacturers announced sizable cutbacks. Small banks in the District have not yet adjusted mortgage rates to reflect the latest sharp decline in market rates.
Bad weather during the February President's Week promotions was cited as a factor in the moderate performance of District department stores. Moreover, some retailers believe consumers spent cautiously because of uncertainty over the course of the economy. Also, several stores noted that consumers seem to be increasing their buying at small specialty and discount stores, leading to lower sales at the department stores.
While some plant expansions and new projects were announced, plans for large-scale employment cutbacks by District manufacturers have recently dominated the news. By the end of March, Eastman-Kodak will have terminated 1,200 jobs in the Rochester area over a three-month period. By year's end, Kodak plans a 10 percent reduction in its worldwide workforce from the 1985 level. A full 10 percent decline in Kodak's Rochester employment would mean the eventual elimination of 5,400 jobs there. Also in Rochester, a GM unit has announced a possible reduction of 1,500 workers as it changes from making carburetors to producing a less labor-intensive fuel system. In addition, while GE plans to hire 270 workers for a new subway repair shop which will begin operating in the Buffalo area by July, it also will eliminate some 1,500 jobs at a Schenectady plant because of depressed demand for the turbines and generators produced there. (In February, the unemployment rates of  6.8 percent in New York State and 5.9 percent in New Jersey remained below the national average.)
High or rising levels of leasing activity are reported in office markets throughout the District, and improving occupancy rates are anticipated. Despite a softening market for downtown Manhattan office space, observers are encouraged by the resurgence of residential and retail development in the area. However, in midtown Manhattan, an oversupply of such space is prompting caution on the part of lenders. In Fairfield, Connecticut fewer new office projects are being undertaken because of concerns that a shortage of affordable housing will limit the county's ability to attract new office tenants.
