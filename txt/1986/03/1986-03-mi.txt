Aided by lower interest rates, conditions in much of the Ninth District have stabilized early this year. Consumer spending, employment, and construction have all done fairly well. Construction has been generally strong, and many new construction projects are planned. Conditions in the resource-related industries, however, are still mixed, and only a little improvement was evident in the agricultural sector.
Despite some slowing late in February, motor vehicle sales have been good so far this quarter. One domestic manufacturer reports that its districtwide sales were up about 15 percent through February, although it has a large inventory of cars and trucks available.
Spurred by lower mortgage rates, housing activity has picked up in district areas with stable or growing populations. Compared with year-earlier levels, residential building contracts awarded in January were up 12 percent in Minnesota and up 19 percent in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area. January home sales in the Twin Cities area were also up a healthy l2 percent from a year ago. In parts of North Dakota and in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, existing home sales appear to be up this year.
