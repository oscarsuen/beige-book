Moderate economic expansion has continued in most regions of the country in recent weeks, despite unevenness across sectors. Recent improvements in economic activity are noted by New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Philadelphia. Richmond and Atlanta report sustained growth at a relatively strong pace, while Minneapolis and Boston indicate mixed conditions with no clear direction for the overall economy.
The major sectors of strength included construction and selected manufacturing industries. Although industrial activity varied across Districts, general improvements were noted for energy-intensive manufacturers such as the lumber, paper, aluminum, and steel industries. Both commercial and residential construction continue strong in most Districts, with several reports noting benefits from falling mortgage interest rates. Major economic weaknesses continue to be concentrated in the agricultural and energy producing sectors, and further deterioration is anticipated because of continuing price declines, especially for oil. Consumer spending growth, although characterized as moderate, was noted in nearly all Districts.
Other Districts continue to show declines in industrial activity. Large scale cutbacks in manufacturing employment were cited by New York, and staff reductions related to business mergers and cost containment programs are noted by Chicago. Manufacturers' inventories are reported to be tolerable, and there appears to be little upward pressures on prices.
Minneapolis, Dallas, San Francisco, and Atlanta report further weakness in their recent declines in oil prices. Minneapolis reports rig counts in North Dakota at the lowest level in five years, and Dallas reports a 30 percent reduction from last year's depressed levels. In Alaska, where oil revenues contribute 85 percent of state revenues, the Governor has already taken steps to reduce state spending.
Auto sales are apparently showing varied temporal and geographical results. Atlanta's report of volatile activity, related to waves of limited-time cut-rate financing deals, was a typical commentary. However, Cleveland reported fairly strong and stable growth of sales, while Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco reported flat, disappointing, or declining auto sales.
The dominant range of outlooks for overall consumer spending and for autos, particularly, seems to be moderate-to-bright. Philadelphia reported that retailers are raising their sales forecasts. Exceptions are those areas most adversely affected by declining energy prices, where spending growth prospects are considerably dimmed.
Commercial construction also continues strong generally, although it is clearly weakening in the Dallas District. Atlanta noted a significant shift of commercial construction resources away from offices and stores toward light industrial buildings.
