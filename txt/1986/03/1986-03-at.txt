Economic activity in most sectors of the Southeast sustained the stronger pace that emerged around the turn of the year. Reductions in borrowing costs and prospects for substantial declines in energy prices have begun to stimulate regional industries, and employment has been growing. With some exceptions, residential and commercial construction activity remain strong. With regard to commercial space, building continues despite high office vacancy rates. The outlook for tourism has improved, and regional airline traffic has responded to declines in fares and prospects of further cuts. Consumer spending has moderated. Many of the region's crop farmers are delinquent on their loans, though prospects are better in a few selected agricultural areas.
Office vacancy rates remain high throughout the Southeast, yet construction continues in many markets. In those markets where office construction is dropping off, light industrial space seems to have grabbed the attention of developers. Overall, construction of retail space has attracted little new interest, and the market for industrial and warehouse space is also sluggish. All sectors of nonresidential construction are facing a slowdown in the New Orleans area, and the continuing decline in oil prices dashes hopes of any turnaround in the near future.
