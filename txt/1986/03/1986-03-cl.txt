District auto dealers express growing optimism about their 1986 sales prospects, and report that sales to date are good. Surprisingly, local auto-sales data have not reflected the monthly volatility characteristic of the national auto market. During the first two months of 1986, unit sales of domestically made new cars in this area were nearly 5 percent above year-ago levels. Most auto dealers, including some import dealers, report that new-car inventories are high.
Mortgage lenders report that falling mortgage rates have prompted a deluge of mortgage refinancings by borrowers with high rate fixed-rate mortgages or adjustable-rate mortgages, generating substantial fee income for the lenders. They expect the strong demand for fixed-rate mortgages to persist, particularly as the gap narrows between rates for adjustable-rate and fixed-rate mortgages. Fifteen-year mortgages are popular despite the higher monthly payments.
Housing and commercial construction is doing very well in some parts of this District, although there is some concern about overbuilding. A major home builder doubts that a building boom will result from the evolving single-digit interest rate environment because there is little pent-up demand for housing and lower interest rates are needed merely to keep housing activity at current levels.
Realtors report closings surged in February and the inventory of listings is declining to a low level. Most realtors have no plans to add staff soon because they are wary about how long and strong the housing market rebound will remain.
