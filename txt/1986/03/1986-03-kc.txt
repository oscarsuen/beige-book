Savings and loan institutions give mixed reports regarding current savings inflows relative to a year earlier, but they expect savings inflows to increase slightly during the next quarter. Mortgage demand has increased, primarily because the demand for refinancing has increased. Mortgage demand is expected to increase further during the upcoming spring and summer home buying season. Mortgage rates have been declining, and most respondents expect rates to remain at their current level or fall a little further. Most savings institutions have not taken advantage of the opportunity to reduce the minimum deposits on MMDA's, Super NOW accounts, and 7-31 day CD's.
All lenders surveyed had acquired a substantial amount of farm real estate through foreclosure. Most bankers reported that they would sell acquired property if they could do so without taking a loss. Only a few lenders said they are selling land as soon as possible after foreclosure, regardless of price. Others expressed concern about "flooding the market." In the meantime, many banks are leasing acquired farmland.
