District nonresidential construction activity expanded moderately, spurred by vigorous growth in Arkansas, Kentucky and Missouri. The value of nonresidential construction contracts grew by 9.6 percent in the June-August period compared with a 1.6 percent national decline. Compared with a year ago, nonresidential contracts were 11.6 percent higher in the three-month period in the District, but 2.0 percent lower nationally.
Local contacts report that the volume of office space in the St. Louis area currently available or under construction surpasses the anticipated growth of demand for the space; thus, vacancy rates, now slightly below the national average, are expected to rise in the next few years. In the longer run, however, the recent changes in the federal tax code are expected to curtail the growth of nonresidential building and reduce excess space.
A recent survey of District banks and thrifts found that most respondents have tightened lending policies for nonresidential real estate loans. With the exception of a few savings and loans in St. Louis and Little Rock, most institutions reported low delinquency and loss rates on this type of lending but indicated increasing caution on new loans due to rising vacancy rates in some markets.
