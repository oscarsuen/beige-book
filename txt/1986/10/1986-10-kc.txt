A number of savings and loan respondents have experienced light to moderate savings outflows recently, while inflows have been slight for others. Most anticipate little improvement in savings inflows until the first quarter of 1987. Demand for mortgage funds has apparently begun to moderate.

And in Oklahoma, some selling has occurred because wheat pasture is flooded.
