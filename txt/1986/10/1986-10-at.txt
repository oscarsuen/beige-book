The Southeast's economy registered mixed performance as weaknesses in some sectors offset strengths in others. Petroleum still tops the list of several weak primary industries in the region. The farm economy remains depressed, and Alabama employment is suffering from coal mine closings. Some commodity exports may be on the rise, however. Vigorous construction and sales of single-family homes are promoting growth of domestic lumber, furniture, and other consumer durable goods production. Tourism too boosted the region's economy. Department store sales outpaced those in the nation, while District auto sales lagged the national rate.
Declining petroleum revenues have diminished tax revenues in Louisiana and Mississippi. In especially hard-hit Louisiana, the governor has imposed a 10 percent cutback in state expenditures at all levels. New Orleans faces severe revenue shortfalls as well. Total employment declined in August in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida. Bank directors report that large Florida computer manufacturers are cutting job rolls as a result of stiff competition and weakness in the computer market.
Demand by the housing industry is stimulating regional lumber production, although contacts in Mississippi report continued weakening in that state. The furniture industry has been expanding rapidly in Tennessee and Mississippi, and home appliance producers in the region have noted accelerating demand, both outcomes due to an increase in home building. Textile industry spokesmen note that their capital spending has gone mainly to productivity enhancement and not to expansion. Department of Defense spending on shipbuilding, uniforms, and electronics is boosting business activity in the region. Tennessee's aluminum shipments, however, have weakened.
Car buyers in the region responded to the special financing programs introduced by manufacturers in September. As a result, inventories of unsold l986 models were virtually exhausted by the second week of the program. Still, the fall sales pace in the region was much below the comparable rate nationally.
District commercial developers face increasingly strict preleasing requirements prior to construction loan approval. Additions to established complexes or new construction in developed areas qualify for lower preleasing requirements; "pioneering" projects are subject to higher standards. Though quoted office lease rates are holding steady, sizeable concessions are pandemic in District markets.
Southeastern coal production for the first eight months of 1986 fell approximately 8 percent below the same period in 1985 as a result of Alabama mine closures. With modest oil price increases, the Louisiana petroleum industry is showing renewed signs of life. Since reaching a low of 92 operating rigs in early August, the state rig count has climbed to 120. Reports from primary industries indicate a recent improvement in export volume.
