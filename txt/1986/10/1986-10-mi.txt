The Ninth District economy appears to be poised for improvement this fall. Labor markets have tightened a bit. Major types of consumer spending have increased. Mining and manufacturing conditions have improved slightly. Government payments and big crops are expected to help agriculture. And the financial sector has adequate liquidity to finance expansion.
Consumer SpendingMajor district retailers have experienced good sales levels early this fall. One retail chain notes an acceleration of activity and expects that October will prove to be its best month of the year. While another retail chain's sales slackened in October, its August and September sales were good. Neither chain reports any serious inventory problems.
District managers for domestic manufactures of motor vehicles report "fantastic" results for September. One of them tabulates that truck sales rose 46 percent over their September 1985 level and says that its dealers already have a backlog of orders for 1987 model trucks. Another reports record monthly sales for both trucks and cars. Both manufacturers' inventory levels are low. A director of this Bank notes that used car inventories are also low in some parts of western Wisconsin.
Housing activity seems strong as well. Home sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area have been quite good. Sales then were 60 percent higher in September than a year earlier, making year-to-date sales more than 35 percent higher than during the same period in 1985. Multifamily housing permits in that area were 115 percent higher this August than last, and residential building contracts in the state of Minnesota grew 51 percent over that period. Bank directors also note some pickup of housing activity in the Iron Mountain area of Michigan's Upper Peninsula and in Bismarck, North Dakota.
