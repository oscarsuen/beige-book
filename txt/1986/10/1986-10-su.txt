Domestic new car sales responded strongly in all districts to national incentives, and 1986 model inventories have been generally worked off. Concern is expressed in some districts about an expected sharp deluxe in auto sales and about the effect of large monthly car payments on discretionary income and other consumer purchases.
Foreign and domestic tourists have bolstered consumer spending in the  New York area. Tourism was up modestly in the Richmond district, but not as much as expected. In the Atlanta district, tourism remains strong but construction of many new lodging facilities has held down the benefits to individual hotels. Tourist traffic has been strong in the Pacific Northwest but disappointing in southern California.
Nonresidential real estate activity is reported as mixed. Commercial vacancy rates are rising in New England's urban centers but suburban shopping mall space is still in demand. Contacts in New York report some pick-up in commercial and industrial leasing. Commercial construction is weaker in the Richmond district, and Atlanta reports sizable concessions on office leasing. The vigorous pace of office and retail building in Chicago is expected to continue into 1987. Moderate expansion in nonresidential construction activity in the St. Louis district has been spurred by vigorous growth in Arkansas, Kentucky, and Missouri.
Manufacturing activity continues to be generally weak, but with some exceptionsâ€”such as defense-dependent businesses in New England, and aerospace and related electronics businesses in the San Francisco district. This  generalization holds even though contacts report modest improvement in some areas and some industries, such as furniture and textiles and apparel in the Richmond and Atlanta districts. Capital spending continues to be weak, with  productivity enhancement a much more important factor than expansion. Manufacturing employment continues to contract, and prices of materials inputs are generally reported to be steady. The USX strike benefited other steel producers in both the Cleveland and the Chicago districts. Steel demand is reported good for autos, appliances, and construction uses; weak for equipment, railroads and shipbuilding. Automobile output has been falling persistently short of plans in recent months, and fourth quarter output plans have been reduced from earlier projections. Although light truck sales are setting records, medium and heavy truck sales have been steady to down.
Small and medium-sized banks in the New York district are coming under competitive pressure to lower lending rates. They are also lowering rates paid on variable rate accounts, and reluctantly beginning to look at "fixed rate" accounts. Some banks in the Richmond district have lowered passbook rates, but with a wary eye on the competition.
