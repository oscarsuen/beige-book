The Second District's economy showed some modest improvement in recent weeks. Retailers had sales gains that were generally higher than expected end residential construction continued strong. Business activity was stable to improved, while some seasonal pickup in the demand for office space occurred. As the general level of interest rates has declined, small District banks report increased pressure to reduce their lending rates.
During August, over-the-year sales growth in the District ranged from 10-20%, while September gains were in a 10-15% range. One retail chain attributed a better-than-average showing among its stores in the District to more favorable local weather and fewer major economic problems such as those currently affecting the farm and oil regions. Among those items generally cited as in strong demand recently were hone furnishings, men's and women's apparel, and various kinds of accessories.
With regard to the outlook, a recent survey (conducted by a national accounting firm) of some 250 upstate retailers indicated widespread optimism concerning sales gains and control over inventories in the fall and holiday seasons.
Overall employment has expanded further in the District, though the manufacturing sector continues to contract. The September unemployment rates in New York and New Jersey were 6.1 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively, well below the national average. In addition, the over-the-year declines in the New York and New Jersey unemployment rates of half a percentage point surpassed the 0.1 percentage point national decline. Concerning the future, with Congress currently debating whether or not to fund further production of jet trainer planes at Fairchild Republic, considerable apprehension exists among the 3500 Long Island employees whose jobs at that plant are at stake.
Some seasonal pickup in commercial and industrial leasing activity has occurred in recent weeks, but conditions in the Second District have otherwise shown little change. Leasing activity in downtown Manhattan reportedly is somewhat stronger than in midtown as demand for space in new financial district buildings remains strong. A more than ample supply of office space remains in northern New Jersey and Fairfield and Westchester counties. However, Westchester has recently been experiencing a flurry of leasing activity as several large firms from outside the county have taken space.
