With the exception of defense-oriented firms, First District manufacturing continues to be sluggish. Foreign sales are picking up for most exporters. Retailers in the region generally saw improvement in September but results were mixed in early October. Prices are stable or declining for manufacturers and rising moderately if at all for retailers. New England's labor markets remain tight.
Prices remain "remarkably stable." Vendor price increases are selective rather than across-the-board, and those occurring recently were in a moderate range of 1 to 3 percent. While prices of some imported goods have risen, contacts said the increases to date have been modest. Competitive pressures keep retail prices in line with vendor prices.
Unemployment remains low in the region. Some merchants have increased starting wages in order to recruit employees, but several expressed the opinion that the problem is not one of wage levels but simply a shortage of bodies to fill "low-skill" openings. Concern is growing about whether enough temporaries will be available to support holiday season sales. But low unemployment has a positive side as well; New England retailers are optimistic about sales in the remainder of the year, citing the region's low jobless rate ad high incomes. Those with branches or affiliates elsewhere report that their northeastern divisions continue to outperform others.
While some firms alluded to tight labor markets, most are holding employment constant or are letting it fall through attrition. A few layoffs have occurred or are contemplated. Respondents foresee wage increases of 3 to 6 percent in 1986. Capital spending also remains minimal and is focused on maintenance, consolidation, or restructuringâ€”not expansion.
Keen competition and oil price declines have combined to keep prices stable or falling. Most firms are emphasizing cost containment, and one reports sharing technology with suppliers to reduce costs. Input prices, including imports, generally remain level as well; exceptions include nickel (because of depleted stockpiles) and semiconductors (because of the recent anti-dumping pact). Although most firms expect few price increases, one suggested that possible cost reductions are almost exhausted.
Only the tool makers have seen a recent pickup in orders. Others, including defense contractors, foresee no major changes. A few respondents cite tax reform as a current concern.
Vacancy rates for commercial real estate in New England's urban centers have risen as new construction has recently come on line in these locations. Retail space in suburban shopping malls, however, appears to be in demand.
