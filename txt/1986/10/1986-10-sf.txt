Car and truck sales grew during the late summer in many areas, although several respondents attribute the strength to incentive financing and expect sales to slow when incentives stop. However, due to lingering weakness in the economies of the intermountain states, car and truck sales in Utah for the first half of 1986 were 7 percent below 1985, while in Idaho they were down 16 percent for the first eight months of the year.
However, weakness in business investment is apparent in other sectors. For example, levels of production and employment in non-defense computer related industries have declined in several parts of the West, including Oregon and eastern Washington. California's primary metals, metal fabrication, and machinery industries also are experiencing declining activity levels.
California and Arizona cotton producers are benefiting from an increased  volume of cotton exports, attributed primarily to the export enhancement  provisions in the 1985 farm bill. Cotton exports through the port of Stockton  increased by 36 percent over last year's level. Wheat exports through western  ports also have increased, but inventories remain high and world market  conditions continue to be depressed.
Forest products companies in Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and northern California also are benefiting from the reduced foreign exchange value of the dollar, although there is considerable variation in the extent of benefit depending on the specific products made in each area. The increased exports have been attributed partly to the reduced value of the dollar against both Japanese and European currencies. Although the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar continues to place pressure on U.S. producers, recent strikes in Canada have helped U.S. prices and production. Throughout the District, forest products firms continue to invest in more efficient equipment and to gain wage concessions. Thus, although industry production is substantially greater than it has been for the past several years, employment and wage levels are unlikely to return to their previous peaks. As a result, the timber dependent areas of the Pacific Northwest continue to experience poor economic performance.
