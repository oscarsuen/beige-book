Available information suggests that slow growth continues in most Federal Reserve districts, although conditions vary substantially across both sectors and regions. Retail sales appear to be growing modestly overall, with substantial regional variation, and domestic automobile sales also show a mixed performance. Summer tourist traffic appears strong in most areas. Manufacturing activity remains weak. The decline in oil prices has hurt manufacturers in some areas, in addition to energy producers. Agricultural producers in the Midwest expect high crop yields, contrasting sharply with the drought-plagued Southeast. Homebuilding continues strong in most areas, although some districts report weakening from the frenzied pace of the spring months. Commercial construction and real estate activity remains in the doldrums in many areas. Total bank loan demand has grown in most districts, with residential real estate portfolios showing particularly strong growth.
Chicago and Minneapolis report that sales of domestic automobiles are outpacing last year's, while the Kansas City and Dallas districts have seen reduced sales during the past year. Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta report improved sales in recent weeks although sales remain below last year's levels.
Nonresidential construction and leasing activity are slowing in most areas, and concessions to tenants are becoming increasingly common. Despite the widespread weakness, particularly in the oil belt, some areas report strength, including New York City, Atlanta, Birmingham, Jacksonville, and Tennessee.
