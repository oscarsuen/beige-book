Sales of motor vehicles generally held firm in June. One large domestic manufacturer reports that its car sales were 3 percent higher this June than last, and while its truck sales were down 10 percent, it only has about two months of truck inventories on hand. The most recent reports indicate that district vehicle sales early in July were 20 percent ahead of sales a year earlier.
Scattered reports indicate that housing activity has remained strong in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, but may have weakened in some other parts of the district. In the Twin Cities, residential building contracts were 55 percent higher this May than last and home sales were 17 percent higher this June than last. Also, members of this Bank's Advisory Council on Small Business, Agriculture, and Labor report housing growth in Baldwin, Wisconsin, and Fargo, North Dakota. But directors of this Bank's Montana branch note slack housing markets in the Bozeman and Billings areas.
