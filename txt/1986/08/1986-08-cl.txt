District auto dealers are showing satisfactory but relatively flat sales of domestic new cars. Domestic dealers' inventories continued to be slightly higher than desired, but no reason for concern. Several domestic auto dealers asserted that low interest rate financing incentives are too costly and no longer very effective. On the other hand, demand for imported cars continues to outstrip supply. One dealer reported that sales have been good despite an approximately 10% price increase in the 1986 model-year imports.
Steel customers apparently have been diverting orders from USX (formerly U.S. Steel) to other suppliers, Including LTV, because of a possible strike against USX widely expected to begin at the end of July. USX recently announced a layoff of 1,400 workers from its Lorain (Cleveland) works because the threat of a strike has caused a sharp drop in orders for that mill. Ironically, production at the LTV East Chicago, Indiana plant has been halted by a strike in response to termination of health and life insurance benefits for retirees. LTV, the nation's second largest steel producer that recently filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, is also being threatened by work stoppages if they ask the bankruptcy court for wage concessionsbeyond those in the labor contract negotiated just last spring.
Housing starts have slowed recently, but builders view that as a temporary result of the unusual delays in obtaining mortgage loan approvals. In recent months, processing times had reached 90 to 120 days as the volume of applications surged. Few mortgage lenders expected the high volume to persist and thus virtually no lender added permanent staff. Real estate closing cancellations had begun to rise as mortgage rates rose and few lenders would guarantee the lending rate beyond 60 days. However, real estate brokers report that mortgage loan processing times are now approaching the normal 60 days.
There are spotty signs that savings and loan institutions in this District are reducing their interest rates on new adjustable rate mortgages to increase their attractiveness relative to the fixed-rate mortgage loans the buyers seem to strongly prefer.
