After lackluster sales in May and June, department store representatives reported a noticeable pickup in early July, attributed at least in part to July's bad weekend weather. Sales of TVs, VCRs, and microwaves are strong in stores aimed at moderate-income customers, while an upscale chain's strongest departments are men s and women's sportswear. Sales of home repair and building supplies remain very strong. There is considerable geographic variation in sales results within the region, but respondents attribute this more to the competitive conditions of specific stores than to differences in the strength of local economies.
Inventories are higher than expected in a number of stores, largely because of failure to attain sales plans. Markdowns, especially for apparel, have been used to keep inventories in check, Aside from promotional reductions, prices are generally steady; several contacts reported, however, that intensified competitive pressures have increased promotional activity and eroded margins for the industry as a whole.
Disappointment with sales gains in recent months has not yet caused retailers' plans for the second half of the year to be revised downward. Merchants remain confident that consumers will continue to be a buoyant force in the economy.
None of the manufacturers contacted has seen an increase in exports attributable to the decline in the value of the dollar, although one representative of the metalworking industry thinks import pressure may be starting to ease. Respondents are continuing with current capital spending plans; plans for 1987 will probably be similar to 1986. None of the firms contacted has seen any significant increases in prices from suppliers; several noted that they cannot raise their own prices. Manufacturing respondents are very noncommittal about future prospects; if pressed, they expect a continuation of current conditions. A couple hope to improve profits through cost saving measures, most notably through consolidations and the sale of excess capacity.
Vacancy rates for office space are up slightly in some parts of the region as new buildings have recently come on line. Rental incentives are being offered, but agents are confident that there will be little problem filling the new space.
