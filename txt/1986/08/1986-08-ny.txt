Higher-priced stores in the region continued to report the greatest year-to-year increases with gains ranging from 8 to 15 percent. Discount stores registered growth between 6 and 10 percent, while medium-priced retailers generally recorded gains of 4 to 7 percent. However, one store in Western New York experienced only a 1 percent increase in sales, substantially below its expectations. Plant closings and recent layoffs reportedly have reduced consumer demand in that area.
Consumer durables, especially furniture, accounted for much of the growth in spending. Sportswear and athletic footwear were also in strong demand. With sales in line with expectations, most merchants were able to keep inventories under control.
Conditions in the Second District commercial real estate market have been mixed. Leasing activity has been strong in New York City and on Long Island, where construction of new industrial and commercial space also has been very activity. In contrast, the pace of leasing in Fairfield and Westchester counties has been more moderate, and some sluggishness persists in northern New Jersey. Few new construction projects are being started in Fairfield County and New Jersey where vacancy rates remain relatively high. Throughout much of the region, concessions to tenants continue to lower occupancy costs.
