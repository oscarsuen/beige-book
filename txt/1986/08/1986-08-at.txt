Industry employment figures continue to show a mixed pattern. While overall employment in the textile and apparel industry continues to decline, carpet manufacturing is strong, and one large producer recently announced expansion plans. Defense spending continues to bolster employment throughout the region, but prime contractors report a fall-off in new contract awards. Lumber exports are increasing with European buyers of hardwoods again appearing in response to the decline in the dollar exchange rate. Less positively, industry sources report a recent slackening in demand for southern pine as a result of slowing housing starts.
Large oil firms continue to announce layoffs in Louisiana as oil-drilling activity steadily drops to new lows. Louisiana's rig count is now 60 percent lower than the severely depressed level of this time last year. Coal industry executives foresee more mine closings in Alabama primarily because of a drop in demand as energy users turn to lower-priced oil.
Sales of U.S.-made autos improved sharply in June as the weaker dollar, lower interest rates, and cheaper gas prices stimulated sales. Even so, sales for the first half of 1986 were below year-earlier levels, with Louisiana registering the largest percentage decline among District states.
Commercial construction activity around the Sixth District remains disparate, and differences in construction vigor are widening. With a five-year supply of unleased office space, New Orleans remains the region's weakest office market, and developers there see little hope for improvement in the near future. In other places, such as Atlanta, Birmingham and Jacksonville, office markets are continuing to expand at a fast pace. Nashville is spearheading the region's growth of industrial construction, with warehouse construction booming as the Tennessee capital develops into a major distribution center. Retail construction is volatile in all District states.
The Southeast's non-energy mineral industries are also experiencing trying times. Phosphate production is about 75 to 80 percent of capacity due to reduced international demand for fertilizer and substantial reductions in planted U.S. acreage. Granite quarries in Georgia are facing cut-backs in production due to shortages in water supplies.
