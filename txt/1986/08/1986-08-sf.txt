Available information continues to suggest that, as expected, tourist related industries in the West will post strong gains this summer. Oregon tourist traffic was 12 percent higher in May than it was in May 1985. Reports from Alaska suggest that a record number of visitors will see that state this summer, providing a welcome boost to the oil-dependent economy there.
Low oil prices continue to take their toll on oil producing areas in the Twelfth District. One respondent reports that in Kern County, California, only 30 percent of oil rigs are operating. In Alaska, one major oil company laid off 100 additional employees last month. Reduced state oil revenues have already led to a 15 percent wage cut for Alaska's state workers, and layoffs or further wage cuts may follow.
