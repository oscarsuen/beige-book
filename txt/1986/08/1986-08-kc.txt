Savings and loan institutions have generally experienced slightly lower savings inflows this year compared with a year ago. Most expect savings inflows through 1986 to remain flat or fall slightly. Mortgage activity continues to be strong, but is not dominated by demand for refinancing to the extent that it was earlier this year. Mortgage interest rates have been steady and are expected to remain stable at current levels for the rest of the year.
Ample rainfall points to excellent crops of corn, milo, and cotton. The corn crop is approximately two weeks ahead of schedule in the district. A burdensome inventory of corn from previous crops and expectations of an exceptionally large crop in the making have forced the price of corn to life-of-contract lows on the Chicago Board of Trade. Of increasing concern to corn growers and their lenders is a critical shortage of storage space for the current crop. In some cases, grower efforts to place corn in storage under CCC loan may be thwarted by a lack of available storage space, forcing the sale of the grain at low harvest-time prices.
Rural communities remain under strain in the district. Bankers report that the pace of farm acquisition through foreclosure was the same or higher than a year ago. In addition, business conditions for local merchants are generally described as depressed.
