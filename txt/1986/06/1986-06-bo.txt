Among product lines, results were similarly mixed. Hard lines, such as electronics and paint, are generally strong. Other items experiencing strong demand include outdoor footwear and expensive housewares, such as crystal. Apparel has performed poorly.
Inventories are higher than last year, but are not, at present, a source of concern for the retailers contacted. In some stores, inventories have been intentionally increased to improve customer service or alter product mix. Although inventories are also high in stores with disappointing sales, most do not plan major price cuts or order slowdowns to reduce them.
Prices are rising very moderately, in the 1-2 percent range. Merchants expect retail prices to remain well-behaved, with the effects of oil price reductions offsetting the declining value of the dollar; however, few have yet seen either oil-related cost reductions or rising import prices.
Stores doing well expect the strength to continue through the balance of the year. Those with weak growth are not making major adjustments, confident that consumer demand will soon be back on track.
Several respondents noted that sales are stronger in Europe than in the United States. These reports referred to sales of subsidiary operations rather than exports. None of the firms contacted has experienced an improvement in business that he would attribute to the decline in the value of the dollar. Respondents in the traditional machinery and metals industries said that Japanese competitors had increased prices 5 - 6 percent; however, they did not think this was enough to change the competitive situation.
One contact noted that prices for imported parts had increased. However, all respondents, including the one experiencing the increase in import prices, said that materials prices are not changing to any significant degree. Several commented on their inability to raise their own prices; one reported that an attempt to raise prices 2 percent on a commodity-type metal product was greeted with derision from customers. Respondents expect wage increases of 0 to 4 1/2 percent.
Respondents consider employment and inventory levels to be a little high and will be taking modest corrective action. Plans call for capital spending to be higher in 1986 than in 1985, but a couple of larger respondents have got off to unexpectedly slow starts on their capital projects.
While manufacturing respondents do not expect a downturn in the near future, they are concerned about a lack of vigor in the economy and they are puzzled by widespread forecasts of a strong second half of 1986 when they see no evidence of any change.
The NEEP forecast calls for employment growth in New England of just under 3 percent in 1986—about the same as in 1985—and 2 1/2 percent in 1987. Growth should be sufficient to maintain an average unemployment rate in the region of close to 4 percent.
New England's growth in 1986 will depend, as it did in 1985, on the non-manufacturing sector, especially trade, services and the finance insurance and real estate group. Manufacturing employment, which declined throughout 1985, will stabilize in 1986.
The NEEP expects growth in 1987 to be more balanced. Non-manufacturing employment will grow more slowly. Construction employment is projected to slip a little from very high levels. Manufacturing employment, on the other hand, is expected to increase moderately—in large part because of an improved trade situation. This pickup in manufacturing employment will be concentrated in high tech and in traditional metalworking and machinery.
