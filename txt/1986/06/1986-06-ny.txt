In New York City, where sales had been slower, recent gains generally matched the pace in the rest of the District. Sales growth in western New York, however, continued to be erratic. One department store chain in that area experienced a 4 percent over-the-year decline in April, but then registered a strong gain of 9 percent in May. Recent sales growth was reportedly higher in Buffalo than in Rochester, where many residents are concerned about large-scale layoffs scheduled for this year at Kodak.
Business ActivityEconomic activity in the Second District weakened slightly in recent weeks. Almost 25 percent of purchasing managers surveyed in Buffalo and Rochester reported a worsening of business conditions in April, up from 18 and 8 percent in March, respectively.
May unemployment rates rose in both New York and New Jersey to levels somewhat above a year earlier. While New Jersey's 5.5 percent rate remains well below the United States average. New York's 7.4 percent is now slightly higher. Employment in the non-manufacturing sector continues to expand, but reports from several firms indicate that further layoffs may occur in manufacturing. In Rochester, for example a 10 percent cutback is underway at Kodak, and a General Motors division there may soon reduce its workforce by several hundred. Downstate on Long Island there is concern that a recently cancelled Air Force contract could mean the loss of several thousand jobs at Fairchild Republic when existing contracts are completed.
On a more positive note, Smith-Corona will increase its workforce by 300-400 in upstate New York and two other firms plan large scale expansions of their research and laboratory facilities. These expansions will result in additional employment in the pharmaceutical and optical equipment industries.
The Second District commercial real estate market has stabilized in recent weeks. While rent concessions remain widespread and inventory levels continue high in some areas, no additional softening seems to have occurred. Vacancy rates have also shown little change recently. Observers anticipate some improvement, however, because the number of plans for new office space is declining in areas of excess supply such as northern New Jersey and Fairfield County.
