Moderate growth is being reported by most Federal Reserve Districts, although the regional variations in economic conditions are substantial. Retail sales are expanding slowly, but several Districts report an acceleration in sales in recent months. Automobile sales are declining from their year-earlier levels and inventories have grown, but remain within acceptable ranges. Manufacturing activity is weak, especially in energy-dependent industries and regions. Past reductions in oil prizes have led to significant declines in drilling. Residential construction activity remains strong overall. Nonresidential building, while maintaining a high level, is beginning to decline. Loan demand has been stable in most Districts. Agriculture is still facing low prices.
Automobile sales are sluggish in most Districts. The exception is Chicago, where sales have been matching last year's levels. Respondents report that a significant portion of the decline was anticipated because of the exceptionally strong sales of preceding years. In the Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Cleveland Districts, sales have been increasing in the second quarter over the first quarter levels, but remain below a year earlier. Inventories are growing, but are still within acceptable levels. For some particularly popular models, however, inventories are lean.
Early reports on tourism support the outlook for increased domestic travel this summer. Respondents report that lower gasoline prices, the weaker dollar, and preference for domestic vacations are the contributing factors. New York reports that foreign tourism is buoying retail sales.
Growth rates of nonresidential building activity are declining or negative in every District that mentions this indicator. Nevertheless, the pace of nonresidential construction remains high in some Districts, notably Chicago, Atlanta, and New York. Retail building is generally the most active nonresidential category. Office construction is the weakest category, with rent concessions resulting from overbuilding in many major cities nationwide. St. Louis and Dallas report absolutely declining commercial construction.
