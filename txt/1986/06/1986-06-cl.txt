Area auto dealers reported much the same story as other retailers. Sales in recent months have been better than the first quarter, but still well below levels of last year. Inventory levels at domestic auto dealers range from slightly above normal to "heavy," but only one dealer expressed any concern over inventories. None of the dealers contacted expected additional near-term price increases, but did mention that past increases have been completely passed on to the consumer.
Real estate brokers continue to complain that a typical mortgage loan application now requires more than 60 days to process. Apparently, mortgage lenders are understaffed but do not expect the high mortgage volume to last long enough to justify expanding staff. Mortgage lenders are accommodating the longer processing times by extending their loan commitments from the standard 30 days to 60 days. Long processing times are not causing a higher level of application cancellations. So far, the suspension of the FHA mortgage-insurance program has had no visible effect on mortgage markets in this region, and FHA lending still represents approximately 12-15 percent of total mortgage applications.
In late May, mortgage lenders increased their mortgage charges slightly by increasing closing points by 1 point and adding 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point to the mortgage rate. The 15-year mortgage is becoming less popular as borrowers return to the 30-year mortgage. The adjustable rate mortgage also continues to lose favor, falling to less than 10 percent of new loans by many lenders in this District.
