Nonresidential building contracts declined by 2.4 percent in the three months through April in the District, but increased by 2.2 percent nationally. Strong growth in Tennessee was offset by declines in Arkansas, Kentucky and Missouri. District nonresidential building contracts were 6.7 percent below year-ago levels compared with a 4.5 percent national decline.
At the end of the first quarter, District banks had reduced their agricultural loan volumes by 9.2 percent from a year earlier. The sharpest reductions were made by banks in Missouri where volumes fell by 18.3 percent. Kentucky banks, however, posted a slight increase in agricultural loans. Overdue farm loans at District agricultural banks continued to grow as a percentage of all agricultural loans but did so at a slower pace than last year. While net chargeoffs at agricultural banks in the U.S. continued to increase, chargeoffs were unchanged for District agricultural banks.
