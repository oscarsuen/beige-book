Throughout the District, preliminary evidence suggests that high expectations for this summer's tourist traffic will not be disappointed. Washington and Oregon should post particularly strong performances, due to Expo '86 in Vancouver. In Seattle, hotel occupancy currently stands 13 percent above its year-ago level. The Portland airport has experienced strong passenger traffic this spring and ticket sales for the Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon are currently outpacing last year's record level.
Forest products companies are enjoying a burst of activity associated with the current surge in homebuilding. Nevertheless, profit margins remain thin, particularly after the sharp drop in prices during the past month, so few firms are expanding and cost cutting efforts continue.
Low oil prices have slowed oil activity in the Twelfth District, although less so than in other regions of the country. In Alaska, the rig count is little changed from the beginning of the year, but exploration activity has fallen substantially. In southern California, one company has put back on line about half of the rigs it closed last month.
Some major crops are quite profitable this year, including apples in Washington and berries in Oregon. However, high prices and low inventories for both products are partly the result of crop damage in some parts of those states. In California, citrus and fresh fruit farmers are doing well, and the lower value of the dollar continues to benefit wine and almond producers. Crop damage to almonds in northern California should further benefit those producers that have good crops.
Refinancing activity is strong for commercial real estate as well, but in most areas there is little demand for new commercial real estate loans. Lenders are scrutinizing closely the applications they do receive because they are concerned about the high vacancy rates and the potential for unprofitable projects.
