Some good news is finally evident in the manufacturing sector. Both of the Dakotas logged small increases in manufacturing employment during April. And while one computer company announced another layoff in Minnesota, it was more than compensated for by a callback issued by another computer firm.
Auto sales appear to have improved in May. One large domestic manufacturer has had particular success selling trucks in this district. Its truck sales were 13 percent higher this May than last. Currently, neither its truck nor its car inventories are excessive, and the firm is optimistic about third quarter sales. As in the case of retail sales, Bank directors note slack auto sales in some non-metro areas, including Miles City, Montana, and parts of western Wisconsin.
Outside of North Dakota and Montana, housing activity appears to have stayed fairly strong. In both Minneapolis and St. Paul, home sales during April and May were way above their levels a year earlier. Low interest rates, economic growth, and good weather have all helped there. Realtors in South Dakota also have found much buyer interest, particularly in the eastern half of the state and its Sioux Falls metro area. New homebuilding is down from last year in Fargo, North Dakota. Residential construction in the oil and gas producing western part of the state has declined substantially.
