Within the manufacturing sector, textile activity remains mostly unchanged while apparel shipments and new orders have increased over a month ago. Import competition remains the main concern of apparel manufacturers. Furniture manufacturers report heavier-than-normal inventories for this time of year, so they plan to close down for two weeks instead of one week in early July. According to furniture manufacturers, their excess inventories are due to lower-than-expected sales, and to retailers holding less in stock. Manufacturers of machinery report an average capacity utilization rate of 51 percent, the lowest of the industries surveyed. On the brighter side, manufacturers of stone, clay and glass products, fabricated metals, and transportation equipment all report increased shipments, orders, and levels of employment.
Mortgage loan applicants continue to experience long delays in obtaining approvals. The delays—often 60 to 90 days, or twice the time it took a year ago—are attributable in part to the time required to obtain appraisals, credit reports, and title searches. Much of the heavy volume is due to applications for refinancing mortgages, but first-time mortgage demand also continues very strong.
Livestock producers continue to face low prices. Beef and pork prices have been held down by large supplies. Poultry prices on the other hand, although also experiencing some downward pressure, should be sufficiently high to yield adequate profit margins, given the lower costs of grain.
