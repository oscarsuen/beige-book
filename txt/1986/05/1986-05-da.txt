The decline in the price of oil has brought economic expansion in the Eleventh District to a standstill. The drilling rig count continues to plunge and there is no sign that the bottom has yet been reached. Contract values for both residential and nonresidential construction are down. Falling demand from the energy and construction sectors has led to reduced sales by manufacturers. Retail sales are soft, especially in the energy-dependent areas of the District. Auto sales have begun to slow from the rapid pace of the previous two years. The recent flat loan demand at the District's large banks reflects the sluggish economy. In agriculture, credit problems are becoming more serious.
