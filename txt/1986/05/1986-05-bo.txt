Expansion in the First District remain unbalanced. Manufacturing activity is generally slow but some firms report encouraging signs. Retail sales are growing modestly, with upscale merchants doing better than discounters. Financial markets are active; real estate and businesses associated with home building are robust and likely to continue so. Outside the real estate sector, prices are generally stable as both consumer and producer markets remain highly competitive.
Inventories are a little heavier than planned in a number of stores, but not a source of concern. In some cases, the pace of restocking has been slowed; others prefer to wait before they take action to see if the situation corrects itself.
Several contacts said they are having difficulty hiring sales help in stores or clerical workers in the home office. Labor markets are reportedly tightening even outside the region's major urban areas.
Prices are generally steady, except for in upward trend in lumber and plywood. Department store buyers report that foreign prices are rising and that they will therefore substitute some domestic goods for imports. According to one contact, consumers don't see much price change because the marketplace is still very competitive and promotional.
Retailers expect the rest of 1986 to be strong in New Englandâ€”"not a boom but good solid demand". These expectations derive from the factors mentioned above, plus reports by those stores with national affiliates that New England again outpaces other areas.
No major improvements are yet occurring as a result of the decline in the U.S. dollar. Several firms note the increased dollar value of sales made in foreign currencies, and one reports shifting some export production work from offshore facilities to its U.S. plants. A contact in the computer industry attributes the lack of real improvement in overseas sales to two factors: first, most of their competitors in Europe are other American manufacturers; second, declining prices create an incentive to postpone purchases in anticipation of further declines.
Inventories are in good shape and head counts are also lean. Capital spending plans are generally unchanged, and reflect programs to improve productivity, not to expand capacity with bricks and mortar.
The outlook is hazy. Firms are moderately optimistic, but in some cases this means they hope 1986 will be level with last year. Current order rates provide no indication that activity levels will shift significantly in the near future, but inquiries and proposals have picked up noticeably for two computer-related concerns.
Activity in the commercial real estate sector is healthy. Absorption rates are high. Prices for retail space in Boston are reportedly escalating, but prices for commercial space elsewhere are rising only slightly.
Residential mortgage activity is at its highest level in several years, causing extensive processing backlogs. Most residential mortgage loan applicants are refinancing existing higher-rate loans. Interest rates are reportedly expected to continue declining, keeping activity at a high level.
Commercial loan demand continues to be strong, especially for commercial mortgages. Contacts report that businesses are refinancing existing debt as well as borrowing for expansion, and both of these activities are likely to continue at high levels.
