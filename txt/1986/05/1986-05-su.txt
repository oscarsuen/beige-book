Virtually all districts report continued moderate economic growth. With the exception of Dallas, which is plagued by problems related to railing oil and gas prices, no district reports general stagnation. Energy sector problems, coupled with problems in agriculture and some manufacturing sectors, have led to unbalanced growth in the Kansas City, Boston, Cleveland, and Minneapolis districts. New York, Philadelphia, and Richmond report a more general improvement.
Consumer spending—particularly for housing—appears to have been strengthening lately. Active housing markets in almost all districts have generated much construction activity, boosted the demand for building materials, and caused a spurt in mortgage lending.
Sources of weakness include the energy and agriculture industries and some manufacturing sectors. Oil and gas price declines have led to drastic cutbacks in drilling activities and related supplies and spending. Low prices still hinder many farmers' attempts to return to profitability. While many districts mention that manufacturing output has been steady or rising, a few point out that manufacturing employment is still falling.
Auto sales, though, have leveled off lately. Kansas City, Dallas, and Philadelphia all say that vehicle sales have fallen off. But Boston has received mixed reports, and Cleveland believes that sales have been high, but flat.
Most districts report very active housing markets—as one New York contact says, in this industry "business is booming." Only the Dallas district reports the opposite. Chicago mentions that housing permits are 40 percent above their level last year at this time. Atlanta also adds that, except in New Orleans and Jackson, single-family home sales throughout the Southeast are higher than a year ago.
Atlanta and Richmond report healthy levels of tourist spending. Some districts are looking forward to more of the same, fueled by lower gas prices, the lower dollar, and citizen concern about overseas travel.
Among the weaker sectors, computer equipment production has remained sluggish in the Boston district. Both San Francisco and Dallas haven't seen a turnaround in the faltering electronics industry, but they think the worst times may be behind it now. While apparel production has remained steady in the Richmond district, Dallas reports a big layoff, but hopes that modernization and marketing efforts will help this sector.
