Important economic sectors of the southeastern economy strengthened in the first quarter. However, the adverse employment impact of declining oil prices on Louisiana's economy and that of other energy-producing parts of the region has masked current and expected improvements. With few exceptions, construction activity is strong, and the activity and outlook for tourism has improved. Consumer spending increased in March following a lull in the beginning months of the year. In agriculture, dry weather has slowed the progress of crops thus tar this growing season.
More job losses are expected as a result or falling oil prices. The rig count for Louisiana has dropped to the lowest level since 1975, resulting in further layoffs by companies that service the dwindling number of offshore oil platforms. The offshore rig utilization rate has dropped to 40 percent from 79 percent in early December, with exploration at a standstill.
More positively, some small towns in the region have been able to attract new industry and diversify their economies out of textiles by taking advantage of the labor pool of workers displaced by imports or automation. Furniture producers are starting to note moderate backlogs and some overtime work. They, along with lumber producers, are optimistic that falling interest rates will continue to stimulate their industry but are concerned by growing low-cost imports. Several leading furniture manufacturers are discontinuing production of certain items and are instead importing them for resale. The defense-related aerospace industry continues to bolster many local economies throughout the region.
