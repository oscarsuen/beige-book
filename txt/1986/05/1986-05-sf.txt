Economic activity in much of the Twelfth District has shown some improvement during the past month. Most of the District should benefit from the recent plunge in oil prices, although oil producing regions have been hit hard. Consumer spending, while no longer growing at its previous high rates, remains high and shows no sign of slowing. Lower interest rates have generated renewed optimism in the construction and wood products industries, while the slump in high tech appears to have bottomed out. Weakness continues, however, in the agriculture and	mining sectors.  Nevertheless, strong loan volumes suggest that the overall mood is optimistic.
Other manufacturing industries, such as aluminum, are likely to benefit from reduced energy costs. In some cases, these lower costs could make previously unprofitable plants profitable for the first time in years.
In contrast, the forest products industry currently is posting its best performance in several years. Lower interest rates and the reduced foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar have boosted prices of some products to 22 percent above their year-earlier levels, while lumber orders at West Coast mills reportedly reached a record level during the week of March 8. One respondent reports that lumber mill inventories are at their lowest level in two years. Although lumber trade volume through some Northwest ports had not yet picked up in February, industry sources remain optimistic about future prospects.
Sustained weakness in copper prices continues to be a problem in Utah and in parts of Arizona. In contrast, gold mining is a healthy industry in Nevada, which currently produces more gold than does any other state.
Agriculture continues to show weakness due to low prices and increased competition from abroad. Despite the overall weakness, some crops, including many fruits and vegetables, continue to be quite profitable.
