Since year's end, conditions have not changed much in the Ninth District. Early in the first quarter, employment grew slightly. Overall, consumer spending growth was modest, with the exception of large gains in housing. Resource-related industries remained mixed, with good performance in the wood products sector but poor conditions in the energy sector. The agricultural outlook has not improved. Agricultural banking issues dominated the district's finance sector.
Sales of motor vehicles have leveled off and may even be below year earlier levels. For one large domestic manufacturer, district car sales were running 16 percent below last year's level, while its truck sales were down 4 percent since a year ago. New car sales were weak in both western Montana and Bismarck, North Dakota, but were good in Fargo, North Dakota, and Pierre, South Dakota.
Housing activity has been generally quite strong. Realtors report that more homes were sold during March in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area than during any other previous month. Requests for FHA appraisals in the Twin Cities were also higher in March than ever before. Lower mortgage rates have also been spurring house sales in other parts of the district, including western Wisconsin.
Tourist spending at district ski resorts was mixed this winter. Business at some big Montana resorts was harmed by late starts and high winds. Resorts on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan also had a less-than-desirable season, according to a Bank director. But another director says a resort in northeastern Minnesota that usually loses money actually turned a profit this winter. In preparation for the summer season, many Minnesota resorts are expanding their facilities.
The U.S. agriculture department's dairy herd buy-out program has received much attention.. Nearly 10 percent of Minnesota's dairy farmers will be paid a total of $145 million to shut down operations for at least five years. The participation rate was lower in Wisconsin, according to a bank director. The buy out spurred many farmers to sell off their cows, at least temporarily lowering cattle prices and infuriating ranchers.
FinanceAgricultural banking issues predominated in the district's finance sector. A group of seven rural Minnesota banks announced a program for reducing interest rates on farm loans secured by real estate, The Minnesota legislature enacted an interest buy-down program for farm loans, and participation has been so heavy that the program's budgeted funds have already run out. However, Minnesota's governor has promised continued funding for the program.
