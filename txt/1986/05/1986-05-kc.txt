Savings and loan institutions have experienced reduced savings inflows relative to a year earlier, but give mixed reports about their expectations for the months ahead. Mortgage activity continues to increase mainly because of the strong demand for refinancing. In areas where homes are selling, mortgage demand is expected to increase further over the next few months. Mortgage rates have been declining along with rates nationwide. Most respondents expect mortgage rates to fall a little more but feel that increases could occur later in the year.
District lenders are completing their spring loan arrangements. In some areas up to 10 percent of borrowers have been denied credit, though about 5 percent seems to be more representative. Even lenders not denying credit to clients report that conditions are somewhat tighter than last year, and the number of marginal borrowers is up from a year ago.
