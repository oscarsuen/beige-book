In general, the Second District's economy has continued to improve since the last report. Retail sales showed over-the-year gains, particularly at higher income levels, and inventories remained in line. The spring homebuilding season was off to a good start, and the demand for office space continued to increase. Business activity was stable to somewhat improved. Demand for commercial mortgages has increased at small District banks as a result of declining interest rates.
Despite some difficulty in predicting sales, District stores were generally able to keep inventories in line with desired levels. Most retailers planned promotions and sales similar to earlier years, though some higher-priced stores bad more spring promotions this year. Sales of apparel end housewares—highly advertised items—were especially strong.
Plans for several plant expansions and relocation into the District have recently been announced. These included an $11 million renovation and modernization at a Buffalo food plant, a $6 million expansion of a ceramics and brick plant in Niagara Falls, and the move to central New York of some frozen food operations from an Iowa location. In addition, an electronics firm that invested $14 million at its Long Island plant last year plans even larger capital outlays at that location in 1986.
Offsetting these developments, however, were announcements of some further layoffs and plant closings. In the Buffalo area, Westinghouse announced plans to close a factory, idling 800 workers by year's end. Layoffs associated with the recently announced production cutbacks at General Motors and further restructuring at Union Carbide could also have a negative impact on the District's employment. Thus far, however, the unemployment rates for March of 6.7 percent in New York and 4.2 percent in New Jersey remained below the national average.
The commercial real estate market remained relatively strong in the Second District, and the demand for office space has increased further in several areas. The pickup in office leasing activity was most evident in Fairfield County, in northern New Jersey, and on Long Island. Nonetheless, conditions generally continue to be characterized as favorable to tenants, and rent concessions have been widespread in some areas. New York City's efforts to expand its office market to the outer boroughs were recently rewarded. British Airways announced that it will move its U.S. headquarters to Queens, and a stock exchange subsidiary plans to relocate its corporate headquarters to downtown Brooklyn.
