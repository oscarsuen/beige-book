Economic activity in the Southeast remains mixed. Manufacturing employment has posted little growth, although employment growth in services is accelerating. Residential and commercial construction is active, but there has been a shift away from multi-family dwellings and office building. Lending has remained strong, but consumer purchases of cars and other durables have slowed. Stabilized oil prices have prevented further economic decline in the western part of the District. Crop production and income will be down substantially, although citrus growers should do well.
Manufacturing employment has registered little change since the first of the year. Lack of demand for petroleum-related machinery and nuclear power generating equipment has forced layoffs in some regional states. A slump in some capital goods markets—electronics and construction equipment—has hurt fabricated metal producers. Labor disputes in the steel and transportation equipment industries have idled nearly 4,000 workers in Alabama.
More positively, apparel and textile employment has been increasing since July. Employment growth for food processors has been steady; falling commodity prices have stimulated this industry.
With the ending of aggressive marketing and financing programs in October, District car sales returned to the sluggish pace prevailing earlier this year. Car dealers in the region also fear that September sales have borrowed heavily from demand late this year and early in 1987.
Contacts in Miami report an all-time high of condominium inventories, and poor demand has brought multi-family construction in New Orleans to a standstill. Although builders in Atlanta and Nashville note slowing of construction, they believe their markets will fare better in 1987 than most in the nation.
Commercial developers across the Southeast report slowing activity and anticipate further deceleration in the coming months. New Orleans remains the region's weakest market, but contacts there report some expansion of retail construction to meet the demands of tourists and conventioneers. The south Florida market remains saturated with office, retail, and industrial space. Atlanta's glutted office market is leading developers to focus on retail and industrial construction. The relatively short construction time required for completion of such projects also suggests these markets will soon be saturated. Nashville developers are confident that their market will continue to experience strong but "controlled" growth.
In response to the effects of tax reform, demand for home equity loans has surged across the region. Bankers say these loans have gained popularity because they retain at least partial interest deductibility under the new tax laws. Some bankers expect many homeowners to substitute these loans for card and installment credit.
Agricultural conditions are mixed; poultry and livestock producers are doing rather well, but income is down for most crops. Recent unfavorable weather and insect and disease damage have lowered field crop prospects in Louisiana, while recovery from the drought in Tennessee and Alabama has improved expected yields. Florida orange and grapefruit crops are projected to be almost 8 percent greater than last year. The lumber market has been relatively stable in recent weeks; prices have been modestly higher than during the summer but 10 to 20 percent less than last spring.
