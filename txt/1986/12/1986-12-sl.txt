A recent survey of District bankers indicates a continued willingness to make consumer installment loans as they have not experienced rising delinquencies. Bankers are actively promoting home equity lines of credit in response to the phasing-out of the tax deductibility of consumer interest costs. One large bank has eliminated all points and closing costs for home equity loans until January 31, 1987.
During the last five weeks, numerous banks and savings and loans have lowered their passbook rate to a range of 4.8 to 5.0 percent. One large bank, however, in an attempt to gain market share, increased its rate to 6.0 percent for accounts maintaining a minimum balance of $200.00.
Harvests are nearly complete or are ahead of schedule in all District states except Missouri where heavy October rains delayed corn and soybean harvests. Flooding destroyed approximately 4 percent of Missouri's soybean crop. Despite the adverse weather, Missouri farmers enjoyed a record corn yield and a strong soybean yield.
