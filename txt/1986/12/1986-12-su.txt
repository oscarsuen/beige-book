District Reserve Banks report economic conditions ranging from sluggish to generally good with more than half indicating some recent improvement. Strength in consumer spending is somewhat more widespread than in the last report, and most retailers anticipate a moderate to good holiday season. Residential construction continues at a healthy pace, but nonresidential construction has slowed as a result of oversupply. Manufacturing is still relatively weak, and some increase in input prices has been noted. While the energy sector remains depressed, an increase in the number of operating oil rigs has occurred. Farmers experienced near-record corn and soybean yields in some areas despite heavy rainfall, and livestock producers are benefitting from higher prices. Commercial bank loan activity has improved because of some upturn in business lending and strength in real estate and consumer lending. Many commercial banks are actively promoting the use of home equity lines of credit for consumers to retain interest deductibility under the new tax law.
All districts reporting on auto sales had strong gains in September and a sharp dropoff in October, mirroring the national pattern.

Nonresidential construction has slowed in Atlanta, Dallas and parts of New York where an oversupply of office space now exists. In Chicago and Minneapolis, however, work on new office buildings continues at a steady pace. Reflecting higher demand for space, vacancy rates in the Minneapolis district fell between June and September for both office and industrial buildings.
Several districts noted that banks are promoting the use of home equity lines of credit as a means for consumers to retain some measure of interest deductibility under the new tax law. Atlanta reported that demand for home equity loans "has surged across the region", while Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and St. Louis noted an expansion in banks' promotion of these credit lines.
