Domestic automobile sales in the fourth district have generally followed national trends in which sales dipped sharply after incentive programs expired. Inventories at non-GMC dealers remain on the low side, especially on small cars. GM dealers report that inventories are manageable, but this appears to be due to their reluctance to order large quantities of new models. Import dealers report mixed sales, but all state that inventory levels are rising.
The service sector appears to account for much of this growth. Over the past year, service industry employment increased by 7.0 percent, compared to 4.7 percent for services in the U.S. Overall employment grew by 3.0 in Ohio and 2.4 percent in the U.S. Business service industries were particularly strong in Ohio over the year, expanding employment by 13.2 percent.
Fourth quarter 1986 employment projections by Cleveland employers suggest that these employment trends will continue for the rest of the year.
Manufacturers report an increase in new orders, production, and prices but constant inventory levels during October. Part of the increase in production is attributed to the beginning of production of new car models. However, a current strike at a GM facility has caused the shutdown of operations of a number of assembly plants in the district, in addition, GM recently announced that two large assembly plants employing 6,400 workers in the Cincinnati area will be closed by 1990.
Steel production in the fourth district continues to increase modestly, despite the continued shutdown of USX. Raw steel production in the first part of November was 13 percent above the pre-strike level. Falling inventory levels have now reached their lowest level in two years. Capacity utilization is still relatively low at 58 percent. Specialty steel production is also up. One customized steel finishing company reports that they are fully booked through December and overbooked through January.
Many midwestern mortgage borrowers prefer to lock in currently low mortgage rates, apparently because they perceive the current level of mortgage rates to be the trough in long-term rates for this economic cycle. Nonetheless, the adjustable rate mortgage is growing in popularity.
