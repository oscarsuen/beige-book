Compared with the results of last month's survey, those for this month show a larger percentage of manufacturers optimistic about their business prospects six months from now. Forty-five percent of the respondents indicate that they expect increased sales as a result of improved international trade conditions, while 15 percent expect reduced sales due to less favorable international trade conditions. All but a handful of the remaining respondents indicate that international trade conditions have no influence on their businesses.
The loans are structured in various ways. Most are tied to the prime rate, but some are tied to T-bills or CD's. Some banks offer the option of balloon payments or a rollover of the principal at maturity periods of up to 15 years, or amortization in monthly installments.
Most of the banks offering the loans describe the response with words such as "very strong," "dynamite," and "hot," although four banks located in a relatively depressed part of the District did not regard the response as unusually good. Bankers feel that home-equity line loans will become increasingly popular. One respondent describes these loans as the most significant new product since money market accounts.
