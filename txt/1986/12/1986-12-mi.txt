Moderate growth appears to have continued this fall in the Ninth District. Labor market conditions have held firm, as have most types of consumer spending. Aggregate nonresidential construction has held up, as has the district's important wood products sector. The agricultural outlook has been brightened by the likelihood of big crops and their attendant government payments. But farm bankruptcies have not abated.
Still, Twin City manufacturing employment continues to be affected by the problems of its large multinational manufacturers. One of those recently announced that 1,000 of its 19,000 area employees will be laid off by January.
Motor vehicle sales have also been consistent with the national trend; they have fallen off recently after big gains earlier this fall. The district office of one domestic manufacturer notes that this October its car sales dropped 4.2 percent below last October's level. Another manufacturer reports a similar pattern, but notes that its inventories are still low.
Bank directors and members of the Ninth District Advisory Council on Small Business, Agriculture, and Labor report healthy levels of tourist spending in most district tourist areas. They say summer spending was generally higher than last year, as expected, and most are expecting winter business to be brisk.
Housing activity has slowed from its rapid pace earlier in the year. Minnesota's Twin City area home sales were lower this October than last. Over the same period, multifamily housing starts were also lower there. A banker reports that bad weather slowed housing activity in South Dakota as well. But a Bank director notes that the demand for seasonal dwellings in Minnesota resort areas has been good.
