Economic activity in the First District remains sluggish. Retail markets in the region softened in October and were mixed in early November; nonetheless, sales remain solidly ahead of last year. Extensive promotional activity is holding down prices. Manufacturers continue to report that business is slow, with no evidence of a pickup. Price competition from both domestic and overseas producers is said to be very intense. Respondents are devoting much attention to cost containment.
Prices have changed very little because retailers perceive a need for persistent promotional price reductions. According to one contact, "Customers are looking for victory every time they go into a store." In a similar vein, a department store representative reported opting for more and shorter sales events rather than a few traditional "big seasonal sales" to satisfy consumer demand for more reduced-price merchandise. The decline in the value of the dollar may force some price increases, however. A contact from a discount chain expects vendor prices to rise fairly soon because of exchange rate changes; the chain imports a substantial fraction of its products. This contact also expects to be buying more goods in the United States in response. But neither of these changes has yet occurred.
First District merchants are moderately optimistic about the remainder of the year. They expect "pretty good" Christmas sales, finishing out the year with sales growth between 5 and 7 percent on a comparable stores basis.
Cost containment is receiving much emphasis. Most respondents have ongoing inventory control programs that are enabling them to operate with lower inventories than in the past. Employment levels are being reduced, even at firms with satisfactory sales results; more attention is being paid to the efficiency of white collar personnel. Capital spending plans for 1987 are conservative; contacts planning to reduce spending outnumber those planning increases.
The manufacturers contacted either report no increases in input prices or report increases in the 2 to 4 percent range, which they expect to offset with efficiencies in purchasing procedures. Several respondents have recently instituted increases in their own prices of about 3 percent. However, competitive pressures are said to be very intense, with domestic competitors mentioned as frequently as overseas producers.
