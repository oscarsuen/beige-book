The modest uptrend in the Second District economy continued in recent weeks. Retailers reported over-the-year sales gains in October ranging from moderate to very good and residential building remained strong. Business activity was generally steady to improved, though leasing of office space moderated in some areas. Small Second District banks report that home equity lines of credit represent only a small portion of their consumer loans.
Sales increases during October were from 6-13 percent above year-earlier levels and, in most cases, were 2 to 3 percent higher than targeted. As a result, inventories are well under control and respondents do not anticipate the need for heavy promotional activity in order to move merchandise during the coming Christmas season. Retailers generally expect moderate over-theâ€”year gains in holiday sales but one respondent, whose Christmas catalogue orders have been strong, is looking for a double-digit increase.
News concerning the District's employment outlook has been mixed in recent weeks. On the negative side, G.E. plans to end its color TV tube operations in upstate New York, where it continues phasing out large engine production, and ITT may cut back its international operations in New York City. On the other hand, several thousand jobs in the chemical and transportation equipment industries have been retained due to the successful negotiation of some longstanding problems. In addition, a new railway car plant has opened in Yonkers and plans for a sizable new operation in the garment industry have been announced. As of October, unemployment rates in New York State and New Jersey remained 1 1/2 percentage points below the national average.
With regard to the District's longer term development, New Jersey officials recently announced plans for the first new rail line in the New York metropolitan region in 50 years. The $825 million trolley-bus system will link billions of dollars of proposed residential and commercial projects along 15 miles of the Hudson River waterfront.
Leasing activity in the commercial real estate market was at a slow to moderate pace in much of the Second District during recent weeks. A major exception was downtown Manhattan where leasing of new financial center buildings remained strong. While no dramatic absorption of space occurred in areas such as northern New Jersey, Fairfield County, and Westchester County, where more than ample supplies of office space exist, few major new projects have been undertaken there in recent months. As a result, vacancy rates in these areas have shown over-the-year declines. However, in downtown and mid-Manhattan, where many new buildings have come on line, rates have moved somewhat higher though they are still well below the national average.
