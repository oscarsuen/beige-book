Reasons cited for these closings include foreign competition, excess capacity, high labor costs, and mergers. A Chicago-based paper company is cutting 1,000 jobs after a merger, and its local headquarters is expected to close. At least two more tire manufacturing plants in Illinois and Iowa are likely to be shut down. Additional jobs cutbacks have been announced in computers, health care products, banking, machine tools, and heavy-duty transmissions. On the plus side, additions to employment totaling nearly 400 are planned by two consumer appliance makers in Iowa, a response to strong demand. Also favorable are the expansion plans of Japanese vehicle producers in several locations.
