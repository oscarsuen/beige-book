During recent months, economic conditions in the Ninth District held steady. In some areas, employment grew better than seasonal norms. Both consumer spending and tourist activity made some gains. Resource-related industry performance remained mixed. Although crop conditions have generally been excellent, higher yields will probably lead to lower market prices.
Motor vehicle sales in the district have been good in metro areas but poor in rural areas. One large domestic manufacturer reports that its district sales of cars and trucks are still above last year's levels. Another manufacturer says that its sales in farm communities were flat in July but expects sales to increase after the harvest. Neither manufacturer has high inventories. One Bank director reports slow auto sales in Bismarck, North Dakota, while another reports increased sales during June and July in parts of western Wisconsin.
Homes are still selling well in many parts of the district. Both the unit and dollar values of Twin Cities home sales exceeded their year-earlier levels by over 35 percent in July. However, a logjam of closings has slowed the cash flow to realtors. Building permits in the Twin Cities were 25 percent higher in the second quarter than they were a year earlier. A Bank director from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan reports that new home sales in the Iron Mountain area have been good. In contrast, both building permits and home sales in Montana have been substantially lower than last year's.
