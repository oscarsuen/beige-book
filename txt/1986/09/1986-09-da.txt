The District economy continues to suffer from the weakness in energy and construction, but there is some evidence that the rate of decline in economic activity has slowed. The drilling rig count hit a low in June and has increased slightly since. The value of construction contracts grew during the three months ending in July, but remained well below a year earlier. The manufacturing sector is still sluggish overall, owing to weakness in construction and energy, but there are signs of improvement in some industries. Falling retail and automobile sales reflect the overall deterioration of the District economy. The level of liabilities in the District's large banks is declining. Ranchers in the District are expected to benefit from higher meat and poultry prices, but agricultural credit conditions continue to deteriorate.
