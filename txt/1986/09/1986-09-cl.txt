Most of the domestic-auto dealers contacted report generally flat sales of new cars. New car inventories remain at slightly higher-than-normal levels, but all of the dealers contacted report the desire to keep a tighter control on inventory levels.

Builders in this District report a seasonal slowing of single-family home building during August. Traffic and new orders are down about 10 percent from July.
