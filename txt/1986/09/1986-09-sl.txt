Southern parts of the District report significant degrees of drought-related stress. Counties in northern Mississippi have requested federal disaster relief for drought-affected soybean crops. Arkansas farmers are estimated to have lost up to $200 million due to the impact of dry weather on livestock and crops. Yields of major Tennessee crops are estimated to be 25 to 35 percent below last year. While less severe than in Tennessee, Kentucky agricultural officials also report lowered yields of most crops.
