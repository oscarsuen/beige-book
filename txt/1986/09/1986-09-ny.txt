In general, the Second District economy registered a modest improvement since the last report. Most retailers had sales gains that were at or above plan. Residential construction remained strong, and business activity showed some pickup. Demand for office space was slack (as usually is the case this time of year), and few new projects were announced. Over the past year, small District banks have experienced increased competition from larger banking organizations in the market for business loans.
While July is traditionally a month in which retailers clear out summer stock, sales of apparel were particularly strong during the recent period. In addition, a pickup in demand for consumer durables was also noted, with one store reporting "exceptional" sales of furniture and rugs. Continuing interest on the part of foreign visitors was cited as an important factor in the improved consumer spending, particularly in New York City. Industry sources attribute this increased foreign buying to the decline in the value of the dollar.
In upstate New York some 2000 of an expected 10,000 soldiers have already arrived at Fort Drum where a new Army division is being assembled. The Pentagon plans to spend some $1 billion on construction in the area, and the addition of these soldiers and their families is expected to provide a significant stimulus to the regional economy. This should offset to some extent the impact of GM's recently announced plans to lay off or transfer 1200 of its foundry workers in that area over the next two years.
The Second District commercial real estate market has shown little change in recent weeks, and conditions remain somewhat mixed. Only a few major new projects have been announced as most areas adjust to the ample supply of office space currently available. Leasing activity has been seasonally slow in many areas, and the prolonged sluggishness in northern New Jersey persists. Some pickup has been noted in Manhattan, however, where a major brokerage firm recently announced that it will occupy the last of the World Trade Center buildings in its entirety. Throughout the District observers anticipate that the new tax reform bill will curtail the pace of speculative office building.
