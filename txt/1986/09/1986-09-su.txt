All districts continue to report sluggish economic growth. Retail sales continued to improve over the summer with moat districts reporting strong consumer demand. Prices are stable and largely unaffected by the lower value of the dollar. Manufacturing, however, generally remains weak. Homebuilding continues strong, but high vacancy rates and the provisions of the new tax legislation have caused nonresidential construction to lag. Both commercial and consumer lending  have slowed, while mortgage lending remains strong. Crop yields will set new records in many Midwestern states, but will strain grain storage capacity. Recent rains have improved prospects for some crops in the drought-affected Southeast, but have arrived too late to help the corn crop.
Most districts reported sluggish domestic auto sales. Philadelphia and Chicago, however, reported strong sales. Sales of imported cars were strong in all reporting districts despite recent price increases.
Chicago indicated that work stoppages this year have held back production more than in recent years. Both New York and Chicago reported shortages of skilled labor for the homebuilding industry.
San Francisco indicated that the dollar's depreciation has had little impact on most manufacturers, while Atlanta reported that it has helped the pulp and paper industry by allowing higher prices for some of their products. Boston reported downward pressure on the prices of manufactured goods due to competition from both importers and domestic producers. Philadelphia and Atlanta indicated manufacturers in their districts expect improvement in the next six months; those in the Fourth District anticipate little change. Chicago reported that demand for steel for appliances and construction has increased this year, but is down for autos and the oil and gas industries.
Nonresidential construction is slowing in most areas. High vacancy rates reported by New York and Atlanta and concern over tax reform have affected commercial construction. Atlanta noted, however, that the national concern over the effects of tax reform on commercial real estate is not shared by local developers who feel that regional economic conditions will far outweigh any negative effects of tax reform.
