The holiday season is expected to help bolster year-end revenues so that final fiscal year results show positive growth in the low single digits. Despite the challenging US retail environment that is prompting at least one contact to take a more conservative stance in 2018, most respondents said the US economy is strong and this factor, combined with high employment and healthy labor markets, will encourage consumer spending.
All the manufacturing respondents were optimistic about 2018. A maker of semiconductor equipment said that the industry may reach the peak of its cycle relatively soon.
All respondents expected tight labor market conditions to continue into 2018, and most saw a more challenging market for staffing firms with increased competition for the remaining labor supply.
As usual, many contacts cited upward pressure on prices as an issue resulting from the shortage of inventory. For single family homes, the median sales prices were up in all areas but Connecticut. Condo prices displayed a similar upward trend, except in Boston and Vermont.
Residential contacts expressed concern about the possible impact of the tax reform bill in Congress, which they feared could increase the cost of buying a home and disrupt the housing market.
