A contact in the Massachusetts restaurant industry reported that restaurant revenues through June were up about 3.6 percent from a year earlier. Restaurants in tourist areas such as the Berkshires, Cape Cod, and Boston's North Shore have experienced severe staffing shortages, especially those that have historically relied on seasonal workers needing H2B visas. This labor shortage has had a negative effect on revenues in what is traditionally the high summer tourist season. There is also concern among many Massachusetts restaurant owners that the just-signed law "Further Regulating Employer Contributions to Health Care" imposes substantial penalties on employers whose (non-disabled) employees obtain health coverage through MassHealth (Medicaid, CHIPS) or receive subsidized coverage through the state's health insurance exchange.
Only one contact reported a major revision to capital spending plans. The dairy firm said that capital spending was up more than 40 percent last year as they expanded alternatives to traditional dairy products such as almond milk. A manufacturer of electrical equipment said that political pressure had led them to reduce off-shoring to Mexico and China and to increase spending on factory automation.
All respondents said the outlook was positive. A manufacturer of test equipment said that uncertainty about the federal budget and shutdowns was a cause for concern.
Multiple firms cited the current political situation as a negative influence on hiring; health care reform was singled out as a source of instability, as job applicants now seek employer-based coverage as their top job benefit. All contacts said they are adapting to the tight-supply landscape through targeted recruitment including an expanded online presence, a better referral process, active community engagement, and building stronger relationships with job market candidates.
Commercial real estate sales fell modestly in Boston and Portland and remained light elsewhere in the District. Prices for premier office properties in Boston were stable despite a modest decline in the number of interested buyers. Maine saw an uptick in retail vacancies and retail property foreclosures. Throughout most of the District, investor demand for industrial properties remained robust, and banks bid aggressively to lend to industrial buyers. At the same time, some banks required more equity on loans for construction of new apartments. One new hotel project was proposed in the Portland area, which reportedly has enjoyed a strong summer tourism season. The outlook among contacts was mostly unchanged, and contacts were cautiously optimistic on balance.
Low inventory prevails. On a year-over-year basis, all reporting areas experienced a sharp decrease in inventory for both single-family homes and condos. A contact pointed out that varying rules across cities and towns created regulatory difficulties for home builders.
Contacts expressed concern about the decline in sales, noting that as prices increase, potential sellers become wary about finding new listings elsewhere and may be less likely to list their homes. Nonetheless, some contacts expect the market to become more active with the prospect of rising interest rates.
