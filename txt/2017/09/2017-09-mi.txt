Wages grew moderately since the last report. A South Dakota contact said there was pressure to boost wages and companies "seem to be willing to pay a bit more" for talent. A staffing contact said that the recently passed $15-per-hour minimum wage in Minneapolis--being implemented over five years--was rippling across wage expectations of workers earning below or near that level. Some wage sentiment was softer, however. The aforementioned poll of ag bankers found that two-thirds believed 2017 wage increases would be between 1 and 3 percent. A Minnesota construction company said that office personnel wages "had very modest increases this year for some, and none for others."
Summer tourism has been generally positive. South Dakota's annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally saw an uptick in attendance of almost 5 percent over last year. Most regional and state fairs have seen increased attendance. Glacier National Park summer visits were up 25 percent over last year's record attendance. But attendance at other District national parks was spotty. Minnesota hotel occupancy rates in July were strong overall compared with a year earlier, but some weakness was seen in St. Cloud and northern Minnesota.
Commercial real estate grew modestly since the last report. Industrial vacancy rates were at very low levels in Minneapolis-St. Paul, though rental rates were flat. Office vacancy rates were flat to slightly lower. Despite continued strong multifamily construction, vacancy rates in Minneapolis-St. Paul and Missoula, Mont. remained low. Residential real estate sales slowed in July compared with a year earlier. Though increases were seen in a few markets (northern Wisconsin; Missoula and Bozeman, Mont.), most markets saw declines, including a 5 percent drop across Minnesota, which was widely attributed to low inventory.
