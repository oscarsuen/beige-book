Sentiment among tourism and hospitality contacts across the District remains cautiously optimistic. Reports noted an increase in the number of visitors in the first four months of the year compared to the same time period last year. However, contacts noted that the pace of food, beverage, and merchandise spending from visitors slowed since the last report, a trend that is expected to persist for the remainder of the year.
Many District commercial real estate contacts reported improvements in demand that have resulted in rent growth and increased absorption, but the rate of improvement varied by metropolitan area, submarket, and property type. The majority of commercial contractors indicated that the pace of nonresidential construction activity had risen from one year ago, with many reporting increasing backlogs. While most reports indicated that the pace of multifamily construction matched or exceeded the year-ago level, a growing share of contacts reported that multifamily construction is down. Looking forward, the majority of District commercial construction contacts expect nonresidential construction activity to increase in the second quarter, while expectations for the pace of multifamily construction was mixed.
