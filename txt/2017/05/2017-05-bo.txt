No contacts reported revisions to capital spending plans. An aerospace and industrial distribution firm said that they had placed a convertible bond last week and there was strong demand.
The outlook was generally positive but cautious. One contact said they initially attributed down sales earlier in the year to the fact that the relevant comparison period, the first quarter of 2016, was exceptionally strong, but continued weakness has made them wonder. Several contacts expressed concern about policy uncertainty and said that was holding back spending.
Most contacts seemed optimistic about market activity and continued strong buyer demand, despite the strains on inventory. Many noted that low unemployment has helped spur consumer confidence, which contributes to the demand for residential real estate.
