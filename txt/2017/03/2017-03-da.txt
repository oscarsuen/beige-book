Gulf Coast refiners noted seasonally strong utilization rates, despite lower margins in January. The competitive advantage of domestic chemical manufacturers (who use natural gas instead of oil as an input) has increased in 2017 thanks to a larger spread between oil and natural gas prices. The outlook for chemical firms remained healthy because this feedstock cost advantage is expected to persist. Refinery business is not expected to fare as well in 2017 as in 2016, as large inventories and expectations of moderate demand growth will keep margins modest.
Apartment demand stayed solid, and occupancy rates generally remained high. In Houston, despite better-than-expected demand overall, occupancy dipped and rent concessions continued to be offered. This was particularly the case for class A product due to a surplus of new deliveries and completions. Rents rose further in most major metros, but contacts expect rent growth to moderate this year. Austin and DFW office markets remained strong, while continued weakness was noted in Houston. Industrial availability was tight in most major metros.
