Energy Energy activity across the District increased moderately in January and early February, and the outlook remained optimistic. The number of active oil and gas drilling rigs continued to increase modestly, primarily in Oklahoma and New Mexico as activity focused on the Oklahoma SCOOP and STACK plays and the Permian Basin in New Mexico. Respondents expected global markets to balance by mid-year, and thus, projected oil prices to increase further throughout 2017. However, they remained cautious given the rapid increase in domestic activity. Some respondents expressed concern about labor availability and increases in the costs of oilfield services. On the natural gas side, spot prices fell somewhat in January amid warmer-than-usual temperatures. However, lower natural gas production was expected to keep prices from falling significantly. Agriculture Farm income remained subdued in the Tenth District, and farmland values declined modestly since the last reporting period. Cattle, wheat, and corn prices were lower than a year ago in early February and continued to weigh on farm income in the District, despite slight improvements in hog and soybean prices. All District states reported slightly lower farm income and expected further declines in the coming months. Farmland values and cash rental rates for farmland continued to trend lower at a modest pace and were also expected to decline further in the months ahead. Alongside persistent declines in farm income and farmland values, agricultural credit conditions weakened modestly, as farm loan repayment rates edged lower and demand for short-term financing remained strong.
