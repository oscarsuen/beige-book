Boston area hotels posted an 81.1 percent occupancy rate and another consecutive record high daily average room rate for 2016. Based on advance hotel bookings, projections for 2017 were similarly upbeat. However, some hotel and restaurant groups feel that the executive order limiting travel from certain countries may have adverse business effects as the United States may not be perceived as a welcoming country. Adding this worry to other concerns raised by a strong U.S. dollar, the possible effect of Brexit on the British exchange rate, and the outcomes of upcoming elections in key European countries creates some significant uncertainty about how the tourism sector will fare in 2017.
Although contacts were generally positive about the near-term outlook, many expressed concerns about policy changes from the new administration. Three mentioned that the border adjustment tax would present a problem for them. A manufacturer of semiconductor equipment said that restrictions on the H1B visa program would affect its ability to staff positions. Another said that uncertainty about policy was the problem; for example, a border adjustment tax would have a big effect on where they located future production facilities and they would be reluctant to commit to new investment without some resolution of the issue. One contact noted that a risk in the coming year was that a plateauing of sales in the auto industry would lead to discounting of new cars and resulting pricing pressure on suppliers.
Median sales prices rose year-over-year for single-family homes and condos in every reporting state and the Boston metro area. A Rhode Island contact commented that "as prices rise, more people will see gains in home equity which will give them more freedom to move. That should provide some relief to our supply shortage." Overall, contacts were optimistic about housing markets going into 2017.
