Real Estate and Construction District real estate activity expanded slightly since the previous survey period, and respondents expected further gains moving forward. Residential home sales declined slightly from the previous month, with sales of low- and medium-priced homes outpacing sales of higher-priced homes. Residential home inventories moved modestly lower from year-ago levels. Contacts expected low inventories to constrain sales in the next few months and anticipated sales would be flat. Residential construction activity grew slightly, as housing starts and traffic of potential buyers rose, while construction supply sales were stable. Respondents expected overall residential construction activity to increase moderately in the months ahead. Commercial real estate activity continued to expand modestly as vacancy rates declined and absorption, completions, construction underway, sales, prices and rents increased. A modest expansion in the commercial real estate sector was anticipated in the coming months. Banking A majority of banking respondents indicated stable demand for commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, residential real estate, and consumer installment loans. Demand for agricultural loans was mostly mixed in June. Most bankers indicated loan quality was unchanged compared to a year ago, and expected loan quality to remain essentially the same over the next six months. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories, and a majority of respondents reported stable deposit levels. Energy Energy activity rose at a modest pace, while expectations eased slightly but remained positive. The number of active oil and gas drilling rigs continued to increase across the District, but respondents expected the pace of growth to slow in the coming months due to flat prices and the continued oversupply of oil. Contacts also reported a moderate decline in access to credit, particularly from banks, while private equity continued to be readily available. Expectations for future oil and gas prices moderated somewhat as a result of the continued increase in U.S. oil production and ample natural gas supply. Furthermore, contacts said that although the oil and gas prices needed to increase drilling substantially has continued to decline modestly, it remained above their current one-year ahead price expectations. Agriculture District farm revenue remained subdued since the previous reporting period as most agricultural commodity prices remained low. Corn and wheat prices increased slightly, but were lower than a year ago due to elevated global supplies. Similar to last year, District contacts reported that corn and wheat prices remained below levels generally thought to be profitable and financial stress continued to increase at a gradual pace for many producers. Soybean prices declined slightly from the previous reporting period and were also slightly less than a year ago. Livestock operators were slightly more optimistic than earlier, as cattle prices increased modestly from a year ago. Hog prices also increased modestly from the previous reporting period as global demand for meat products remained relatively strong.
