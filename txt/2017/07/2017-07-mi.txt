Wages grew moderately to strongly overall since the last report. A central Minnesota contact said wage pressure is "a big deal for companies with entry level jobs," and a regional survey there found that half of respondents were increasing wages to deal with a tight labor market. Average wages for 18 Minnesota construction unions saw annual increases of between 3.3 percent and 5 percent in recent three-year contracts negotiated in May. A Minnesota food processing company increased union worker wages by close to 3 percent annually over four years; a Montana natural resource company increased wages by a total of 5 percent over a two-year period. In North Dakota, state budget difficulties have resulted in a freeze in salaries for many state and higher education workers.
Tourism activity was flat overall since the last report. May visits to national parks in the District were down 2 percent from a year earlier. Demand for hotel lodging in Minnesota was flat in May from a year earlier. In contrast, gaming revenues in Deadwood, S.D., increased 8 percent in May.
Commercial real estate was mixed since the last report. A contact in Rapid City, S.D., said transaction activity there has been strong. "Apartment complexes get sold within a week of listing." Retail vacancy was described as "pretty stable," while office vacancy appeared to be rising thanks to new space coming to the market. Retail vacancy rates have continued to rise slowly in Minneapolis-St. Paul, thanks to a significant amount of space vacated by large retailers. However, another source noted that retail space under construction was lower than a year earlier and grocery expansion continued to eat up available space. Despite strong construction activity, multi-family vacancy rates remained low in the region, and rents were rising. Residential real estate was mixed. Closed sales rose in northern and western Wisconsin counties located in the District compared with a year earlier; sales also grew in Sioux Falls, S.D. Sales were mixed in Montana--strong in the Flathead region, flat in Missoula, but lower in Helena. In Minneapolis-St. Paul, May sales fell by almost 2 percent, while sales in the rest of the state were flat, attributed largely to low inventories of homes for sale.
