On balance, wage pressures continue to be muted; the percentage of nonmanufacturing firms that noted rising wage and benefit costs is as low as any time in the past three years. Wage pressures continued to be greater in those markets with low unemployment rates.
Pennsylvania staffing firms struggled to find qualified and committed workers. Staffing contacts reported spending more time and money on recruiting labor and refilling positions after the initial hire quit, sometimes after just a few days. Workers appear to have less loyalty to the job, and more job-hopping is showing up on résumés. However, one large retailer reported having no difficulty getting quality job candidates in locations throughout the District after raising its base wage last year.
Retailers and food service providers noted that ongoing low commodity prices have helped their margins, while homebuilders are facing 20 percent higher lumber costs caused by trade tariffs against Canada. Contacts noted that the added cost can be more easily absorbed while building high-end homes, but can make low-end homes less viable to bring to market.
The makers of paper products, chemicals, fabricated metal products, and industrial machinery continued to note gains in activity; these were joined by gains reported by the makers of electronic products. Firms in the primary metal sector appeared to be gloomier, noting reductions of new orders and shipments.
Generally, manufacturing contacts continued to expect growth over the next six months; however, the percentage of firms expecting future increases edged down slightly for employment, capital expenditures, and general activity.
On balance, auto dealers reported a slight decline in year-over-year sales during the current period, with Pennsylvania sales edging up and New Jersey sales declining modestly relative to last year's high levels. Falling used car prices have been a contributing factor to softer demand for new cars. Dealer profitability continued to be a struggle, and some dealers and analysts are revising year-end sales totals downward.
Tourism activity continued to grow at a modest pace, according to several contacts. Delaware shore contacts noted exceedingly heavy traffic on the roads and significant tourist spending, but that last-minute bookings had not lifted hotel occupancies as much as expected. Still, bookings remained ahead of last season. Atlantic City casino revenues also remained up over the prior year.
Expectations about future growth have ebbed further since the prior Beige Book period but have remained positive with a little over 50 percent of the firms anticipating increased activity.
Banking contacts tended to describe the economy as stable and their loan portfolios as healthy with low delinquencies and few areas of concern.
Brokers in most major Third District housing markets continued to report modest growth of existing home sales, but no increase of inventories. In the Greater Philadelphia area, pending sales of houses (under contract) dropped slightly. Overall, existing home prices continued to edge up with some variance across markets and price categories.
Nonresidential real estate contacts reported essentially no change in construction activity, which had grown modestly last period, although individual markets do vary by sector and geography. One contact noted that the construction pipeline may have begun to diminish. Leasing activity continued to exhibit little change overall. Rents were rising nearly everywhere for industrial/warehouse space; contacts noted plenty of demand and that new buildings continue to lease up before completion. However, rent concessions have emerged for multifamily units in the city of Philadelphia.
