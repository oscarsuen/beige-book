On balance, the economy in the Fourth District expanded at a modest pace since our last report. Manufacturing output weakened slightly. The housing market improved, with higher unit sales and higher prices. Nonresidential contractors reported very favorable results for the first quarter of 2016. Midway through the first quarter, consumer spending at retail outlets and restaurants increased on a year-over-year basis. Motor vehicle sales continued to move higher. The demand for credit by commercial and retail customers was unchanged. Although regional natural gas output remains at historic highs, some upstream oil and gas companies are finding it more difficult to access credit. Freight volume expanded along seasonal trends.
Payrolls showed a modest contraction on balance during the past six weeks. Robust increases in construction jobs were offset by declines in manufacturing, energy, and freight transportation. Wage pressure was most evident in the entry-level and high-skilled segments. Staffing firms reported an increase in job openings and placements, primarily in healthcare and technology. One staffing firm noted that most openings were for part-time jobs. Overall, input and finished-goods prices were steady. Energy and commodity prices drifted lower.
A modest increase in capital budgets was reported over the period. Monies were allocated primarily for new equipment and maintenance projects. Capacity expansion was cited by several contacts. Downward pressure on energy and commodity prices helped push input costs lower. Finished-goods prices moved slightly lower in response to rising competition and declines in raw material prices. On balance, manufacturing payrolls shrunk across job categories. Firms cutting employment cited a need to reduce costs because of weakened demand. Other than cost-of-living increases of 2 percent to 3 percent, wages held steady.
Nonresidential contractors reported very favorable results for the first quarter of 2016. The unusually mild winter resulted in higher revenues than expected. Financial market volatility had reportedly little impact on customers' willingness to move forward with projects. Construction project pipelines are strong and backlogs continue to build. Several builders expressed concern about their capacity to take on additional projects. Demand is broad based, though it is weighted toward higher education- and healthcare-related projects. In general, contractor revenues for all of 2016 are expected to be on par with or higher than those of a year ago. Over the past couple of months, many general contractors were able to increase their billing rates with little pushback. These higher rates enabled them to cover rising labor and development costs and to build margins.
Capital budgets are allocated primarily for expanding capacity, including investments in technology, equipment, and plant expansion. General contractors reported rising prices for concrete and drywall. Prices declined for other commodity-based products such as shingles and diesel fuel. Otherwise, materials costs were stable. Reports indicated robust hiring over the period across job categories. Hiring was for newly created positions and replacement. The current pace of hiring is expected to continue into the summer months. Wage pressures are mainly limited to craft workers and project managers. Subcontractors remain very busy. They are challenged by labor shortages, and, as a result, many are selective when bidding. In order to cover rising labor costs and to widen margins, most subcontractors are increasing their rates.
Year-to-date sales through February of new motor vehicles rose 7 percent District wide compared to those of a year ago. Purchases of light trucks and SUVs continue to dominate the market. Dealers expect new-vehicle sales to remain stable at high levels this year. Transaction prices rose slightly during the past couple of months, but manufacturer incentives have been keeping pace. Leasing continues to gain in popularity. In Ohio, 45 percent of all new-vehicle transactions are leases. As the spring selling season approaches, dealers are adding to payrolls, but the market for sales and service personnel is tight, putting upward pressure on wages.
