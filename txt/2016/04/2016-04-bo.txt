Most First District businesses continue to report rising sales and revenues. Retail and tourism contacts mostly cite positive results; two-thirds of contacted manufacturers and software and IT services firms report sales increases. Home sales are up in all six states and commercial real estate market conditions vary across the region. More respondents say they plan to increase hiring than has been the case in the last few Beige Book rounds and some mention wage increases. Contacts cite no price issues, although several manufacturers and retailers note positive effects of low energy prices. Outlooks are generally positive, as contacts expect recent results to persist.
Final 2015 results for Boston hotels recently became available: new all-time highs were set for occupancy rates (81.8 percent) and average room rates ($255 per night, up 6 percent over 2014). The hotel forecast for 2016 as a whole is robust, with the average occupancy rate down slightly and the average room rate up, to yield an expected 5 percent increase in hotel revenues. A contact notes that corporate travel activity, while still strong, may have softened a bit, but that leisure travel is holding up; however, international visitors seem to be spending less in high-end stores, perhaps because of the strength of the U.S. dollar. Boston-area restaurants are doing much better in the first quarter than a year earlier. Boston's tourism forecast for the second quarter is strong; besides the seasonal boost from college graduations, more corporate meetings are scheduled and leisure travel is expected to benefit from the beginning of new and/or direct flights from Europe and China.
Overall, none of our contacts report significant price pressures either on the supply or demand side. Several contacts note that the benefits of lower energy prices are finally showing up in their bottom lines. All but one of our contacts report that they are hiring. The semiconductor firm reduced hiring during its slowdown last year but is back to normal now. Several firms report that it is hard to find or keep workers; a manufacturer of garden hoses says that finding low skill workers has become very problematic. A chemical firm is raising wages by 15 percent at a southern U.S. facility to keep trained workers from leaving. Respondents report no news on inventories aside from idiosyncratic factors.
Capital expenditures are up or unchanged for all but one contact. A specialty chemical maker says they exhausted the incremental gains from plant improvement and are considering building a new plant for the first time since well before the 2008 recession.
The outlook is positive for all manufacturing respondents except the furniture manufacturer. A publisher has a positive outlook for the first time in many years.
Prices are stable at the healthcare and business IT firms, and up 4 percent from last year at the primarily manufacturing IT firm; the latter also expanded margins by actively cutting expenses. A healthcare IT firm notes that increasing employee healthcare costs was a burden.
Hiring is net positive for all contacts. A healthcare IT firm is hiring across the board, while business and manufacturing IT firms are hiring more selectively in growth areas. They all say wages are increasing in the mid-single digits, though several note particular competition for developers.
A healthcare IT contact is optimistic and expects steady growth for the foreseeable future; most hospitals in the United States already use some sort of automation software, so opportunities for growth are mainly overseas. A manufacturing IT contact is optimistic, feeling that currency headwinds are dying down and the domestic economy is stabilizing. Their main concern lies with potential weakness in Europe, as it has been a "bright spot" during an otherwise soft few years. A business and consulting IT contact also expresses optimism but sees some uncertainty in domestic markets--particularly with the election cycle--and identifies overseas factors as the biggest potential destabilizers.
Low inventory continues to affect the First District residential real estate market. For both single-family homes and condominiums, inventory decreased or remained flat year-over-year in every state but Rhode Island. Despite the modest inventory increase in Rhode Island, our contact says that the "quickening pace of sales is beginning to outstrip supply." All reporting states recorded a decreasing number of days on market and months' available supply of single family homes and condos since February of last year. Contacts in Vermont and New Hampshire say the inventory shortages are attributable to both lagging construction and a dearth of sellers of existing houses coming to the market.
Overall, respondents say the pending sales numbers indicate a bright outlook for the residential real estate market. Contacts predict that the costs associated with buying a home will continue to be low, as there is no indication that mortgage interest rates will increase any time soon. Recent mild weather has helped the market to start the year strong and contacts expect this to continue into spring.
