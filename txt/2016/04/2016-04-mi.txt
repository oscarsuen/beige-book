The Ninth District economy grew moderately since the last report. Growth was noted in consumer spending, construction, real estate, manufacturing, and professional services. Tourism and mining were mixed, while energy and agriculture were down. Labor markets remained tight, while wage pressures were moderate and price pressures remained low.
Tourism conditions were mixed since the previous report. Canadian travel to eastern North Dakota dropped due to the strength of the dollar, according to a travel agency representative. A northern Montana ski resort reported that visitors since the last report were down only "very slightly," which one official considered "not too bad given the crunch we're feeling from the lack of Albertan visitors." In Wisconsin, visits to the state's tourism website rose 24 percent in the past few months "after late snows arrived for ski enthusiasts," according to a tourism official. Visits to the South Dakota Badlands were up since the last report, which officials attributed to low gas prices, a mild winter, and a new visitor center at a historic site.
Commercial real estate activity was moderate since the last report. In Minneapolis-St. Paul, vacancy rates remained low, and several sales of apartment complexes saw notable price appreciation. In Sioux Falls, vacancy rates for industrial, office, and retail space were flat or falling since the last report; however, apartment vacancies have risen. Residential real estate activity was moderate, while low inventory was inhibiting sales. Rochester saw January-February home sales drop by 8 percent over a year earlier. "The primary story...is a dwindling supply of inventory," according to an industry source. Homes for sale in Minneapolis-St. Paul in February were almost 20 percent lower than a year earlier, and were at record lows. Early 2016 home sales were up in Bozeman and Missoula, Mont., compared with a year earlier, and rose by 10 percent across Minnesota and by 12 percent in 14 northern Wisconsin counties.
Wage pressure was moderate. A Minnesota staffing firm said there was a "slight increase" in starting wages since the first of the year. In Minneapolis-St. Paul, a teachers union received annual raises averaging 2.25 percent over two years, and a service workers union negotiated a four-year contract with a total wage increase of 12.3 percent, reportedly its largest in 20 years. Some skilled labor categories were seeing wage increases; a survey of high-tech employers in Montana found that wages were expected to rise 5 percent this year. Price pressures remain low. A Twin Cities builder said the firm was "projecting flat overall pricing." A Minnesota manufacturer noted that "steel and plastic raw material prices remain low, but I suspect steel will begin to increase this summer." A railroad serving the District announced a reduction in shipping rates.
