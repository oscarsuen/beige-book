Sixth District business contacts indicated that economic conditions, from mid-February through March, were unchanged from the previous report. However, the short term (next three to sixth months) outlook for growth among the majority of firms remains positive.
Retail sales grew for low-end retailers, while high-end sales softened over the reporting period. Automotive dealers cited improved sales levels since the previous report. Tourism-related contacts noted domestic and business travel remained solid. Residential real estate builders indicated that construction was up, new home sales were slightly up, and inventory levels were mixed compared with a year ago. Residential real estate brokers indicated that existing home sales were mixed and inventory levels were down from a year earlier. Most real estate contacts noted modest home price appreciation. Demand for commercial real estate continued to improve and construction increased from the year-ago level across most of the District. Manufacturers cited increases in new orders and production. On balance, bankers reported improvements in credit conditions. Reports on hiring were mixed. Firms noted stable wage growth and soft non-labor input costs.
Across the District, hospitality contacts reported domestic and business travel remained strong, while Florida and Georgia reported softening demand from international visitors from a year ago. Capital expenditures on tourism-related infrastructure for 2016 are expected to be in line with or above 2015 levels. The outlook remains optimistic as advanced bookings in the hotel and conference segments is strong for the second quarter.
District commercial real estate brokers reported improvement in demand resulting in increased absorption and rent growth across property types, but cautioned that the rate of improvement varied by metropolitan area, submarket, and property type. Commercial contractors indicated that the pace of nonresidential construction activity had increased from one year ago, with many reporting backlogs of one to two years. Reports on multifamily construction suggested that activity remained fairly robust across the District, although there seemed to be growing concerns around overbuilding. District commercial real estate contacts expect the pace of construction activity to increase slightly over the next quarter.
Transportation activity in the District was largely unchanged, on net, since the last report. Year-to-date total rail traffic was down as coal, farm products, petroleum, primary metal products, and forest, lumber, and wood shipments declined substantially compared with year earlier levels; however, intermodal and auto shipments increased. Trucking contacts cited notable increases in overall tonnage during the reporting period. Port contacts cited continued growth in container traffic, bulk and break bulk cargo, and autos.
Most contacts reported relatively stable wage growth, despite continued upward pressure for select high-skill positions and high-demand sectors. Several businesses noted strength in margins, as they successfully held the line on prices in the face of soft or declining input costs. According to the Atlanta Fed's Business Inflation Expectations (BIE) survey, year-over-year unit costs were up 1.3 percent. Survey respondents also indicated they expect unit costs to rise 1.8 percent over the next 12 months.
Agricultural conditions were mixed, while most of the District remained drought free, there were some areas in Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana categorized as abnormally dry. Due to excessive rain and flooding earlier in the year, the USDA designated several counties in central and southern Florida as primary natural disaster areas. Florida's orange crop forecast increased from the previous month but continued to be lower than last season. On a year-over-year basis, monthly prices paid to farmers for corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, beef, broilers, and eggs have declined.
