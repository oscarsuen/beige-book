The Ninth District economy grew modestly overall since the last report. Growth was noted in commercial real estate, professional services, and mining. Activity in energy and manufacturing was steady, while commercial construction and residential real estate slowed from high levels. Consumer spending, tourism, residential construction, and agriculture were mixed. Employment grew moderately since the last report, wage pressures were moderate, and price pressures were modest overall.
Tourism was mixed across the region since the last report. Hoteliers in Sioux Falls reported a "lackluster summer," and they expect flat revenue for the remainder of the year. Hotel occupancy in North Dakota in general has dropped by 21 percent since this time last year; tourism officials attribute this to the "perfect storm" of the falling Canadian dollar and the drop in activity at oil fields. Yellowstone National Park visits were up 6.5 percent during the first six months of the year, and Glacier National Park "shattered" previous visitation records with a nearly 14 percent increase during this period. Park officials attributed the increased activity to the centennial celebration of the National Parks Service as well as low gas prices. However, numbers for the annual motorcycle rally in Sturgis, S.D., were down 40 percent from last year. One regular attendee shared her observation that the turnout was the "lowest in decades."
Commercial real estate activity was moderate since the last report. Apartment sales in Minneapolis-St. Paul continued at a record annual pace through mid-August, according to industry data. Transactions involving industrial space were also strong over this period, both in terms of number and total value, but activity in the office market has fallen off. Vacancy rates for office, industrial, medical, multifamily, and retail space in the region were low. Residential real estate activity slowed from high levels. Closed sales in Minnesota fell by 2 percent in June and July compared with a year earlier. Summer sales also fell in northern and western counties of Wisconsin, and Fargo saw a notable July slowdown. Inventories were lower in most markets, negatively affecting sales, sources said. In Sioux Falls, July home sales were down 14 percent from a year earlier. Inventory was down 9 percent over the same period, but homes below $200,000 dropped by 24 percent.
Wage pressures were moderate since the last report. "We are definitely seeing a steady increase in entry-level wages in recent months, and across industries," said a Minnesota workforce development source. Recently settled contracts for a handful of construction unions in Minnesota saw total compensation increases of 3 percent to 5 percent per worker. However, not all regions were seeing wage increases. A source in Michigan's Upper Peninsula noted that despite strong demand for summer tourism workers, there was "not much of a wage increase."
Price pressures were modest overall since the last report. A recently released construction cost index for Minneapolis-St. Paul reported that overall costs were "essentially flat from last year." A South Dakota source in heavy construction said low oil prices kept a lid on costs for asphalt and fuel. From July to mid-August, average gas prices fell in all District states, but by less than the national average. Based on expected low fossil fuel costs, a Wisconsin utility is forecasting a small drop in electricity rates next year.
