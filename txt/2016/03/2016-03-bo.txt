Most retail and manufacturing contacts in the First District report higher sales or revenues than a year earlier, but far-from-robust growth and, among retailers, somewhat mixed month-to-month changes. Partly because results were weak amidst the region's severe winter weather a year ago, staffing firms cite strong year-over-year revenue growth. Commercial real estate markets are said to be seeing more caution in both leasing and purchases, which, at least regarding the Boston area, is reducing worries about overheated markets. Residential real estate markets remain strong. Staffing firms report increases in wages in the low single-digit range; manufacturers and retailers do not mention wages. Respondents indicate that prices are generally stable. Outlooks are said to be cautiously positive.
The outlook is also mixed; contacts expect fiscal year 2016 same-store sales to be up from 2015 by low-to-mid single-digit percentages. One contact has decided to open fewer new stores in 2016 than originally planned. Nonetheless, most other respondents are engaging in strong multi-year investment plans for opening new stores and enhancing their digital presence.
Firms report a relatively benign pricing environment. A firm in the semiconductor industry says reduced energy prices are not showing up as much as expected in the prices they pay. Many responding firms report that customers continue to pressure them for price reductions. Raw milk prices are down versus exceptionally high levels a year ago. Only one firm reports significant deviations of capital expenditures from plans; this exception is the auto and aerospace industry supplier in which business units, in general, are not using all the resources allocated to them for investment. Otherwise, contacts report no major revisions of their investment plans. Inventories are generally in line with expectations.
One-third of contacted manufacturers report headcount reductions. In one case--a semiconductor-related contact--a reduction of staff at headquarters has long been planned. A producer of milk products closed a plant. The auto and aerospace supplier is laying off workers across all business lines including corporate headquarters as a result of declining sales; these layoffs began last spring and are ongoing.
All of our contacts except the auto and aerospace supplier report a positive outlook. As has been the case since the end of the financial crisis, firms remain somewhat cautious.
Looking to future demand, construction activity increased in Providence following the groundbreaking of a large life-sciences complex, and civil construction is set to increase in Rhode Island in the coming year as the state secured new funding for infrastructure repairs. Around Maine, a small boom in hotel-building is reported, a state office building project is in the works, and construction is steady for multifamily and light industrial structures. Construction activity is roughly unchanged in Boston and Hartford. The outlook for commercial leasing demand weakened further in Hartford amid perceived risks of corporate downsizing, and a Providence contact is also a bit less enthusiastic than in the previous report. Contacts in Boston and Portland remain largely optimistic for their respective cities' leasing environments. However, across the District, contacts perceive downside risks stemming from equity market volatility, given its potential to blunt both business and consumer confidence.
The for-sale inventory of both single-family homes and condos decreased on a year-over-year basis in every state in the First District. Both supply-side constraints (limited construction) and healthy demand contribute to this. This is an issue particularly in Massachusetts and the Greater Boston area, where demand is robust; a contact in Boston notes that realtors are "desperate for listings." Contacts from other states view inventory levels as less of an issue: a respondent in New Hampshire says "improved inventory and affordability remain key factors for continued optimism" and one in Rhode Island claims "there is a decent supply of homes to choose from."
The consensus among industry contacts is that residential markets will continue to perform well in 2016. Many contacts note that mild weather has boosted activity this winter. Contacts are unanimous that the increase in interest rates hasn't reduced demand and that buyers continue to be eager. Several also note that expected 2016 increases in mortgage rates provide incentives for buyers to act now.
