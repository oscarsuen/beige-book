The Ninth District economy grew modestly since the last report. Growth was noted in construction and real estate, tourism, and manufacturing. Consumer spending and professional services were mixed, while energy, mining, and agriculture were down. Labor markets remained tight, while wage pressures were moderate and price pressures remained low.
Tourism conditions strengthened since the previous report. A ski resort manager in northern Minnesota stated that the ski season started slowly in December, but has picked up in January and February. "Revenue in January was the highest it's been since 2010," she reported. Tourism activity was solid in the national parks of Montana and South Dakota's Black Hills, and it carried into the winter months. A state tourism official in South Dakota stated that sales were "tremendous," adding 6 percent to the state's economy. Duluth, Minn., reported strong tourism industry growth and saw an 8 percent increase in food and beverage sales from the previous year.
Commercial real estate activity was strong since the last report. Fargo, N.D., has seen "a lot of activity," according to a local source. In Minneapolis-St. Paul, property sales have been "especially strong" to start the year with some big trades in downtown Minneapolis, said an industry source, while vacancy rates were nearing or below prerecession levels despite significant new construction. St. Paul saw more net absorption in the last year than in the previous 10 years combined, according to an industry source. Residential real estate activity was moderate. January sales were 18 percent higher than a year earlier in Minneapolis-St. Paul, but down 9 percent in Sioux Falls. Local sources in the Butte and Flathead Valley regions of Montana reported strong January activity. However, low inventories of for-sale homes were negatively affecting sales across the District.
Wage pressures were moderate. A Wisconsin staffing firm said that wages for some jobs were still increasing, "but seems to have slowed." Three District cities reported pay raises of 3 percent or more for municipal workers; in one city, workers received their largest raise in five years. A new contract with a large health care union in Minnesota included 2 percent raises for three years. In contrast, a survey of Minneapolis-St. Paul technology workers found that wages rose 9 percent from a year earlier. Price pressures remained low. A Montana utility reported that heating bills were down 14 percent over the same period a year ago due to warmer weather and lower prices. Nonresidential building costs in Minneapolis-St. Paul were projected to rise about 3 percent in 2016, roughly on par with their historical average, according to an industry estimate.
