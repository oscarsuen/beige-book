The Ninth District economy has remained depressed. The construction industry continued in the doldrums, with the only signs of revival appearing in nonbuilding construction (work on highways, bridges, sewer and water facilities, and energy projects). The weak manufacturing, mining, and lumbering industries reported in the last Redbook did not improve in August or early September. Consumer spending remained weak. Farmers were still troubled by falling crop prices, and an early frost could substantially reduce their crop yields. As a result of these continued weaknesses in the real sectors, bank lending in the district remained sluggish.
An immediate pickup in commercial and industrial building is not likely because excess space exists and interest rates are still too high. Our contacts think that many businesses do need additional space and that now is a good time to obtain it; new commercial and industrial building prices are presently very attractive. But interest rates, they believe, are still too high for businesses to take advantage of favorable construction prices. Two executives with large Minneapolis builders indicate that long-term interest rates would have to drop another two percentage points and stay down for several months for any significant pickup in commercial and industrial building to occur. Also, for certain types of commercial and industrial building, excess space is a problem. The current vacancy rate for office buildings in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburbs, for example, is 15 percent, more than twice the 6 to 7 percent rate that realtors consider normal.
The district was fortunate that the recent rail strike disrupted very little industrial activity. Minneapolis-St. Paul business executives have actually been more upset by the prospect of lost revenues due to the NFL players' strike. In Minneapolis, this strike could prevent a planned reduction in a hotel and liquor tax which was imposed to pay for our new $55 million domed stadium.
Livestock prices have exhibited a mixed pattern. Lower crop prices increased the attractiveness of feeding livestock, which has helped to keep feeder cattle prices at their midsummer levels. Also, hog prices have remained at the high level reached this summer. Increased slaughter cattle supplies, however, have pushed the prices of these livestock down; and in mid-September in South St. Paul, they reached their lowest level in 18 months.
In addition to price problems, district corn and soybean farmers also have major concerns about the weather. Due to wet weather delaying spring planting, district crops are maturing later than usual. Normally, for example, about 50 percent of Minnesota's corn crop is mature by mid-September. This year only 23 percent is ready for harvest. A frost in the next few weeks (a distinct possibility) could substantially reduce yields. Although reduced yields in the district would ease the storage problem discussed in our last Redbook, they would not significantly affect prices because the district's share of total U.S. production of corn and soybeans is small. Thus, until crops are harvested, district farmers are faced with the possibility of a bleak scenario: low crop prices, which are virtually certain, and poor crop yields which will depend on the vagaries of the weather.
