Overall deposit growth at Tenth District banks is flat. Several bankers report strong growth in existing NOW accounts, but very few new accounts are being opened. Almost no growth in All Savers Certificates is reported. Most bankers are not concerned about the possible loss of these funds at maturity. One banker reports the cancellation of a planned repurchase agreement account due to the position taken by the FDIC that holders of repurchase agreements at the failed Mount Pleasant Bank and Trust Company have no claim to government securities pledged to back up the agreement.
