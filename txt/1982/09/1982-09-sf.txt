The Twelfth District economy continues to struggle with recession conditions. Consumer spending in August was down or flat in nominal terms relative to a year ago and does not appear to have responded as yet to recent declines in interest rates or lower Federal taxes. Commercial construction is joining residential construction as a depressed industry, although there are exceptions to this weak construction picture in certain areas of the District. The aerospace and electronics industries, although weak, continue to be reliant on military spending for their remaining strength. In the agricultural sector, the picture is highly varied, as bumper crops in certain commodities depress prices but boost processing activity, while other areas—such as potato processing—have suffered severe cutbacks in activity. The most notable developments in banking in the District are the widespread reports of loan delinquencies and foreclosures, and the rapid spread of "sweep" types of consumer deposit accounts. There appears to be little response of corporate investment or finance activity to the recent decline in short- and long-term interest rates.
