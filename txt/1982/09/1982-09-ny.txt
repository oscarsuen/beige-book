The rate of economic deterioration in the Second District appeared to be slowing in August and September. While it is still too soon to tell when the recovery will begin, economic conditions do appear to be less bleak than they were in our last report. Retail sales have improved slightly. Construction activity has held steady with the residential sector still in the doldrums and nonresidential building strong. In manufacturing, layoffs have continued but generally were smaller than in previous months and some recalls occurred. The reopening of a major steel facility offset other plant closings. Business leaders still expected no significant upturn before the end of the year.
Nonresidential real estate activity remained strong with the outlook still cloudy. Projects currently underway were viewed as sufficient to maintain construction employment at current levels for at least the next few months. But softness in the office market was still evident in the New York City metropolitan area with vacancy rates up marginally and rents stable or down slightly. Consequently, developers were reluctant to make long term commitments and were expected to continue to postpone some groundbreakings until the economy revives and the office market tightens. New startups have not disappeared entirely, however. Projects begun included office complexes in Queens and on Long Island, a shopping center in Rochester, and a large truck stop in Buffalo.
Jones: The recessionary U.S. economy has, in all likelihood, not yet hit bottom. Consumer psychology has deteriorated sharply. Businesses are continuing to try to cut back on spending on inventories and plant and equipment. There is increasing emphasis on cost cutting measures including wholesale layoffs of white-and blue-collar workers. It may well be that interest rates, particularly in the longer term corporate bond and mortgage markets, must fall 200-400 basis points further in order to set the stage for recovery. Further declines in interest rates, particularly in the longer term areas, are likely to be limited by the clash between heavy Federalgovernment borrowing and desperate businesses seeking to borrow long to repay short-term debt. The Federal budget deficit for fiscal 1983 could climb to $l60-l70 billion.
The income velocity of money is likely to fall far below its normal 3 percent growth trend both this year and next. The Fed's current tentative Ml target for 1983 leaves virtually no room for economic recovery. Given this prospective drop in velocity growth, the Fed might consider raising the upper limit of its tentative 1983 target for Ml growth, from 5 1/2 percent to perhaps 6 1/2 or 7 1/2 percent.
Stone: It seems to me that monetary policy is exactly on course. It is appropriate that the Fed persist in its efforts to limit the growth of the money supply. But given the state of the economy, the existence of serious financial problems, and the continuing uncertainties surrounding the interpretation of the money supply, it is also appropriate that the Fed be pragmatic and flexible in its approach to limiting its growth.
The System has earned a good deal of credibility among market participants, and I think there is little danger in losing it by being flexible in its approach to controlling the aggregates.
Wojnilower: Reports from sources in industry continue grim as to both current business conditions and attitudes toward the future. They do reflect, however, considerable disinflationary momentum.
Institutional investors assume that the summer's Federal Reserve actions mark a fundamental shift away from money-supply rules toward an employment-oriented policy focused on interest rates such as is believed to have prevailed before October 1979. The stock market advance resembles the similar rather brief and spectacular bull markets that used to occur toward the end of recessions when the economy was seen as bottoming and the Federal Reserve as guaranteeing stable or falling short-term rates until the fact of sustainable recovery had become statistically certain. As a result the financial community is quite complacent that all will turn out well, and tension in regard to potential default problems has subsided to an amazing degree.
