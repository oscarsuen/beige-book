Caution seems to be the key trait in the retail sector. Despite slow-rising retail sales, due in part to buyer uncertainty about jobs and still high interest rates, merchants are apparently satisfied with inventory levels. Retailers have been trying to keep a tight rein on inventories and are buying cautiously for the December holiday season and winter.
Scattered signs of optimism for faster-growing retail sales later this year include reports from Boston and Philadelphia that a strong post-Thanksgiving selling season is expected and from Kansas City that merchandise cost and profit margins are stabilizing. Chicago, on the other hand, finds orders of goods for the winter season considerably below normal and store closings increasingly frequent; Dallas notes a faster-than-usual deceleration of sales following the back-to-school selling period.
Cleveland finds that manufacturing activity has yet to trough and the outlook for the steel industry is dismal. Inventories of oil-field equipment continue to climb; Dallas and Atlanta report that petroleum refineries and chemical plants are operating far below capacity. With the exception of defense-oriented industries, orders at most manufacturing firms have contracted further. Defense contracts are shoring up electronics, aerospace, and related manufacturers in Dallas, San Francisco, Atlanta, and St. Louis. Chicago observes that imports, aided by the high value of the dollar, are taking a growing share of the markets for machine tools and farm and construction equipment.
Capital spending plans are conservative at best. Low demand for the services of plant location advisors in Atlanta and Chicago suggests little new capital expansion for some time. San Francisco reports scant response to the recent decline in interest rates from corporate investors.
Commercial construction is no longer supporting the rest of the construction sector to the extent it did earlier in the recession. In the Cleveland District industrial construction is in a state of "depression"; only St. Louis reports any improvement in commercial building activity. The market for office space remains soft to weak.
Higher costs and lower prices render increasingly remote the possibility of substantial debt reduction for the farm economy in 1982. Atlanta finds growing indications that farm bankruptcies and liquidations will rise in coming months. Bright spots in the farm economy do exist, however. Hog producers and tobacco farmers are in a position to take profits, and lower feed costs should benefit the entire livestock and poultry sectors. Nonetheless, net income for the farm sector as a whole is likely to be below that of 1981.
Although isolated, there are reports of increased consumer borrowing in the aftermath of declining interest rates. Kansas City finds improved loan quality as well. San Francisco, in contrast, witnesses a sharp increase in delinquencies and foreclosures. Deposit growth remains sluggish. Atlanta and San Francisco observe little interest in the 7- to 31-day certificates.
