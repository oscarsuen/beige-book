Indications from the Third District are mixed but point to continued weakness in the local economy overall. Conditions in the manufacturing sector still show no conclusive signs of a turnaround, and retail sales are sluggish at best. In the banking sector, loan demand has risen and a drop in interest rates is reported. The home building industry, despite a drop in mortgage rates, remains in very poor shape.
The outlook for some recovery in the next six months is generally optimistic, but cautious, across all industries. Both manufacturers and retailers are certain that improvement will occur, but are planning on it being slow and late starting. Bankers expect a hesitant recovery, as well, with further distress borrowing pushing up loan volume.
Survey participants are still highly optimistic that a recovery will occur within six months, but appear to be maintaining a cautious stance while awaiting further signs of strength. Nearly 80 percent of the businessmen polled are looking for improved conditions over the next six months. New orders are expected to take off, and, with shipments projected to show slightly less growth, growing backlogs and longer delivery times are foreseen. Producers say the anticipated spurt in activity between now and March will push payrolls and working hours upward and bring inventories into check. But, reflecting continued caution, there is little stock building planned, and capital spending increases will be kept to a minimum.
Industrial prices are holding steady again in September, having shown little inflationary movement at all since April. Flat input and finished good prices are reported at well over 80 percent of responding firms this month. As for the next six months, the projected turnaround in manufacturing activity is expected to rejuvenate inflation but manufacturers foresee only moderate increases in both the cost of raw materials and the prices they charge for their own products.
Looking ahead, weak sales volume is expected to linger on until a projected holiday surge in December. End-of year forecasts are in the 1 to 4 percent range. A Director of this bank, however, notes that small gains over last year's fourth-quarter sales will not be a strong positive signal, as last year's sales were less than robust. Nevertheless, contacts are "guardedly optimistic" that a weak recovery will finally take hold in three to four months, and that sales will climb by two to five percent above year-earlier levels by early spring. Merchants remain cautious about inventories, currently lean and generally below last year's levels, and plan to maintain the present tightness for at least the next six months.
Area bankers have lowered their prime rate to 13.50 percent during September and foresee it dropping further if the recovery continues to sputter. Lenders are now predicting that the prime may go down to 12 percent before leveling off. The expected timing of the trough in interest rates has been pushed back into early 1983 when the projected recovery is forecast to be underway.
Deposit flows in the Third District show a few signs of minor slippage. Time deposits are not as strong as in recent months, but are still 10 to 12 percent higher than a year ago. Demand deposits are reported to be mixed, with some bankers reporting a loss of deposit dollars to various interest bearing assets, including the new 7-31 day time deposit.
