The Twelfth District economy slipped deeper into recession during the past month and further near-term weakness appears to be in prospect. Consumer spending declined in July at both department stores and new car dealerships, and reports for early August suggest no improvement. Homebuilding continues to pick up gradually, but from an extremely depressed level. Moreover, the large inventory of unsold homes and recent Supreme Court ruling permitting Federally-chartered S & L's to enforce the due-on-sale clause on outstanding mortgages suggest that any further recovery this year will be negligible. Meanwhile, commercial construction is slowing. In the manufacturing and mining sectors, a number of industries cut back production further in July and announced further curtailments for August to reduce excess inventory. In the agricultural sector, the relationship between farm costs and prices continues to deteriorate. At Twelfth District banks, real estate loans outstanding continue to grow, but for reasons related to hardship among builders and households rather than strength in construction activity.
