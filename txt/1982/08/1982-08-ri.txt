In this area the greatest difficulties are being felt in such industries as textiles, furniture, building materials, metals, and machinery and equipment.

Delinquency rates are being held to modest increases in nearly all areas, but several Richmond directors mentioned the growing numbers of business and personal bankruptcies as an area of concern. One noted that a loan need not go delinquent before it goes bad, as in the case of a bankruptcy.

Marketing of this season's flue-cured tobacco crop, under way for two weeks, has been characterized by lower grade prices and slightly poorer quality than a year earlier. Because of dissatisfaction with prices, growers have placed more than one-third of gross sales thus far under the government loan program. The crop is some 13 percent under 1981's output.
