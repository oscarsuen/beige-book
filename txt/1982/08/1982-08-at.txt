Midsummer economic conditions in the Sixth District remain weak; however, signs of increasing activity in some sectors are encouraging. An upturn in building permits indicates that the outlook for construction may be brightening. The District's farm economy is also showing some improvement.
Auto sales have come to a virtual standstill since the termination of price promotions in early June. Even in metro Atlanta's relatively strong economy, July and August floor traffic and buying have been quite slow. A spokesman for Atlanta car dealers attributes this slowdown to consumer expectations of further declines in interest rates and of reinstated price rebates.
Bank loans in Georgia, especially to corporations, are reported to be showing strong gains from year-ago levels, whereas loan growth in other states is slowing as acceptable loan customers are becoming increasingly difficult to find. Because of the decline in energy-related business activity, bank lending in Louisiana has been especially hard hit.
Planned capital spending for 1982 amounts to a mere 3.5 percent increase in current dollars over last year. Moreover, most of this investment is concentrated in the chemical and petroleum industries. One bright spot is the Port of Mobile, where recently expanded coal-handling facilities have contributed to a 103 percent expansion in coal exports during the first seven months of 1982 compared with 1981. Ongoing improvements should allow the port to double current coal export capacity by early 1983.
At 9.4 percent, the region's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in June was down fractionally from May and remained slightly below the nation's, largely because of Florida's and Georgia's jobless rates of 7.5 and 7.6 percent, respectively. Four of the six District states continue to have double-digit jobless rates.
Despite some improvement District farmers are not likely to be able to make significant progress toward debt reduction in 1982. Loan delinquencies have declined modestly in recent weeks, but they remain alarmingly high by historical standards.
Estimates varied regarding the timing of recovery. Some respondents felt that the recession had already reached its trough in all District states except Florida and Mississippi, but others were more optimistic regarding Florida's economy and less so regarding Louisiana's. At least one economist predicted that recovery would not begin until spring, 1983, well after the nation's unemployment rate surpassed 10 percent. All those polled expected only a weak or moderate recovery.
None have seen much effect from federal income tax cuts and social security increases because of the offsetting effects of "bracket creep" and higher state and local taxes. Response in Florida was expected to be stronger than elsewhere due to the relatively large percentage of the work force still employed and the state's disproportionately large number of social security recipients. Economists surveyed anticipated retail sales of nondurable goods to be the prime beneficiary of increased disposable personal income.
