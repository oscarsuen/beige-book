Dallas, St. Louis, and Philadelphia report that industrial activity has stabilized. All other Districts but Kansas City report production cut backs that have resulted in layoffs and plant closings. New York, Cleveland, and Chicago cite capital goods industries, in particular, as an example. Cleveland finds major steel producers in great difficulty with inventories high, prices low, orders weak, and capacity utilization at 40-50%. In the Chicago District over half the freight car plants are closed. Only defense related industries, noted by Boston and St. Louis, and some seasonal industries such as food processing, seem to be offering much support to the broad industrial sector.
Dealers are keeping inventories very tight and squeezing profit margins but have been disappointed recently, particularly by the apparent failure of this summer's tax cut and social security benefit increase to boost sales. Retailers have adopted extremely cautious buying plans, hoping that stronger back to school and Christmas spending will materialize, but basically waiting to see before committing heavily.
Durable goods still seem to be the most affected, but San Francisco finds even grocery store sales sliding. Only two areas of relative strength appear: tourist trade is doing well in the mountains of Pennsylvania and in the western half of the Minneapolis District; also, Chicago and Kansas City report recent strength in automobile parts and repairs.
Commercial construction is generally stronger than residential building, but varies considerably from District to District. Most Districts remarking on commercial building find it slowing somewhat or being sustained only by projects already in progress. Dallas reports a high level of activity, however, and Atlanta notes an upturn in permits in early August.
Continuing deterioration of price to cost ratios is depressing farmland prices and eroding the equity position of many farmers. Minneapolis reports storage facilities already near capacity and Kansas City sees the possibility of a shortage later. Furthermore, Minneapolis and Chicago expect relatively small portions of the corn crop to be eligible for support programs. The implications of these conditions for farmers, lenders, and agribusinesses are, in Chicago's view, ominous.
New real estate loans are very weak, but in some areas outstandings are on the rise due to lower turnover rates of residential properties and a modest increase in second mortgages. Additional financing for ongoing commercial projects is also lending support in some areas.
Consumer borrowing is showing few signs of life. In the Third District there has been a mild recovery, but even there outstandings remain slightly below year ago levels.
Recent bank difficulties have reportedly prompted a great deal of caution by banks contemplating extensions of credit.
