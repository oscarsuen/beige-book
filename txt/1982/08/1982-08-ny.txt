The economy of the Second District continued to languish in July and early August, displaying more evidence of deterioration than recovery. Almost all sectors suffered from depressed business activity. Retail sales turned down at many stores. Residential construction showed no signs of pulling out of its persistent slump. Nonresidential construction, however, continued to be the healthiest segment of the region's economy. In the manufacturing sector, production schedules were cut through layoffs and shorter workweeks. Business leaders saw no reason to expect an upturn before the end of the year.
The prospects for new nonresidential construction activity remained weaker than a few months ago, but that sector was healthy relative to the rest of the economy. While the recent softening in the office market persisted, as reflected in a small rise in vacancy rates, a considerable surplus of space that had been anticipated by some real estate brokers has not materialized. Observers nonetheless believed that few new buildings would be started in New York City until the economic recovery was well underway. However, ongoing projects were sustaining a high level of construction. Suburban areas showed some promise of renewed strength, including the commencement of two large scale venturesâ€”an office park and a luxury hotel.
Maude: Strains anticipated in the financial system have been alleviated to some degree by recent easing in Federal Reserve policy. The easing has been accepted by the financial community as appropriate and desirable because of the perception that the recession still persists and the present turbulence in the financial sector. But as signs of economic recovery become more evident and the wave of financial shocks recede, the Fed's credibility will be scrutinized more critically. The most recent easing moves combined with normal cyclical forces will probably lead to a renewed acceleration in money supply growth.
Looking ahead, while interest rates will generally trend down, there will be occasional pressures on rates and a risk of renewed recession over the first half of next year.
Riefler: Business conditions are poor and worldwide credit problems continue to mount. The Fed appears to be properly shifting its focus toward concern about the weak economy. At the same time it would be reassuring to the capital markets for the Fed to define more precisely its longer goal for the inflation rate, which in my view should be zero.
Schott: The widely forecast business recovery for the second half is not yet a reality. Erosive effects of weak cash flow are becoming more apparent in the industrial sector. Repercussions in the financial sector are also spreading.
Federal Reserve policy is mildly supportive of recovery. More may have to be done.
