Reports from the Third District in August fail to give any clear indication of the direction the local economy is taking. Manufacturing remains weak, retail sales have dropped, and business loan demand has tapered off in recent weeks. Area farmers are facing mixed crop yields, and tourist business, although good in some areas, is also spotty.
The outlook varies by industry. Despite persistent sluggishness in the industrial sector, manufacturers continue to look for an imminent recovery. Retailers also anticipate a pickup, but one that is mostly seasonal in nature. Bankers foresee further cuts in interest rates, but softening loan demand, as borrowers turn to long-term capital markets.
Area farm prices are generally strong, especially for those commodities in short supply, but farmers may not get to keep much of the money they take in. Rising distribution and production costs, especially interest expense, will keep the lid on farm income again this year. An official of the Pennsylvania Farmers Association predicts that total interest expense for farmers in 1982 will exceed the 1981 mark of 13.6 percent of gross income.
Despite the continuing slump in industrial activity, more Outlook Survey respondents are optimistic about future business conditions than in June or July. Over three-quarters of participating manufacturers now expect business conditions to improve within six months, and there are widespread predictions of growing strength in both new orders and shipments. In response, local manufacturers plan to expand payrolls and working hours, but projections of weakness in both inventory growth and capital spending raise doubts about the real strength of the recovery.
The prevailing sluggishness in local manufacturing continues to have a stabilizing effect on industrial prices. At over 80 percent of participating firms, neither input nor finished goods prices have changed since July. Looking ahead, however, forecasts of continued stability in prices, apparent in the June and July surveys, have diminished somewhat this month.
Looking ahead, retail contacts see sales improving by year-end, and hope for a reasonably good holiday season. They concede, however, that even with a strong finish, they'll be lucky to break even on the year. They remain very cautious about inventory building, and have no plans to add to current stocks until a turnaround in sales is obvious. Presently, department store inventories are down from August '81 by as much as 10 percent.
The prime rate has been lowered to 15 percent at Third District banks contacted this month, and local bankers are forecasting further cuts. Estimates of a trough in interest rates center around early- to mid-fall. At that time, bankers expect rates to firm up and begin to climb as business investment picks up.
Time deposits at Third District banks have maintained the surprising firmness that has been evident throughout 1982, and are now running as high as 13 percent above a year ago. Demand deposits are still running about 3 to 4 percent behind on a year-over-year basis.
Mountain vacation spots in Pennsylvania, on the other hand, are having a good year. After a strong winter season, summer tourist trade in the Poconos is now well above most expectations. To be sure, the average stay at mountain resorts is shorter this year than last, but late summer and fall business is projected to be strong. Advance reservations are running 10 to 14 percent over a year ago, which should give Pocono businesses a good boost and help them finish well ahead of 1981.
