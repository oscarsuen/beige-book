Savings and loan association officers express increasing dismay over the rising cost of funds and the dismal growth of savings inflows. Most foresee no long-run relief, but many expect a short-lived drop in interest rates to bolster deposits temporarily. Few are making mortgage loans at market rates of 17 percent to 18 percent, and even "blended rate" mortgages ranging from 12 percent to 16 percent are up only marginally over last year.
Tenth District banks are moving cautiously in the area of deposit sweeping arrangements. Although a few of the banks contacted are considering offering deposit sweeps in the future, none are presently offering these arrangements. Most plans presently under consideration involve a tie-in arrangement with a mutual fund, while one bank indicates that excess balances might be placed in the RP markets. While no automated deposit sweeping arrangements are being offered, some cash management arrangements have been made on an individual basis for corporate customers.
