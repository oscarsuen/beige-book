A major producer of machine tools reports order cancellation rates are high and sales of consumable cutting tools and supplies are down. He has furloughed workers in the last month, expects to lay-off more, and foresees no upturn this year.
Pressures on labor and parts suppliers for cost reductions are substantial. A meat packer in Cincinnati is threatening to move unless labor concessions are granted. An auto industry economist reports that because of recent union concessions, his firm's labor costs will rise by 15%-18% instead of 25%-30% over the life of the contract. A truck parts manufacturer has eliminated COLA for all non-union employees. A tire manufacturer has eliminated COLA for white collar workers. A Pittsburgh electrical contractor reports electricians' union acquiescence to time and one-half pay for overtime instead of the area tradition of double time. A bearing manufacturer has received demands from six Fortune 100 customers in the last 30 days for price reductions ranging from 2% to 7 1/2%, and believes his competitor is yielding to similar demands.
Unemployment and Plant Closings. Recession effects have spread and deepened throughout the Fourth District. Unemployment rates are higher in the Fourth District than national average. For the top 11 SMSAs in this District, the January NSA unemployment rates range from 8.8% in Columbus to 13.8% in Toledo and 15.7% in Youngstown.
The rapid pace of plant shutdowns continues in the District. The most recent is the closing of a 65 year old rubber plant in Akron that will result in a permanent job loss for nearly 1,300 salaried and hourly workers. The plant was the sole surviving producer of auto passenger tires in Akron, once the tire- producing capital of the U.S. (Since 1979, 14 tire plants in U.S. have closed.) Also, in mid-February, GMC announced the closing of a stamping plant in Cleveland that employs 1,200 workers. The announcement that a second Cleveland plant, employing 1,700 workers, would be closed apparently will be rescinded as part of the recent GM-UAW agreement.
