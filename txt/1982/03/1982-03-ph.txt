Indications from the Third District in March are that the economic slump is bottoming out for some industries, and that the economy may be on the verge of a turnaround. District manufacturers say the pace of industrial activity held steady this month, bolstered mainly by nondurables. Retail merchants say things are just about where they were a year ago as well, but hope for a push as they enter the Spring selling season. Bankers report that business borrowing is flat. The only real sour note comes from the homebuilding industry where things are simply described as "worse-not better".
Third District businessmen are reasonably optimistic, but not overly so. Manufacturers predict a pickup soon, but are a little less enthusiastic than they were a month ago. Retailers, likewise see some strength, but not a lot. Bankers anticipate little in the way of loan growth, but are forecasting healthy deposit flows and lower interest rates, at least for the near term.
Looking ahead, manufacturing executives polled this month are still optimistic, but, in spite of the apparent turnaround, their outlook has softened. While general business conditions are expected to improve by September at over 50 percent of the firms sampled, a small but significant number of respondents now foresee a drop in activity. Strong growth in new orders and shipments is still widely expected, although not as widely as in recent surveys. Producers remain very cautious, and are planning little expansion of either inventories or capital expenditures before late summer. Any increased demand for their goods will be satisfied by hiring new workers and lengthening hours.
Industrial price hikes are more prevalent in March. Over one-third of the manufacturers responding to the survey this month report higher costs, and nearly one-fourth say they are charging more for the goods they sell. There are widespread expectations of further price inflation over the next six months as well. More than 75 percent of those polled are predicting higher prices for raw materials by September, and over 50 percent are planning to raise the price of their finished goods.
Looking ahead to the next six months, retailers seem to be planning for a fairly tough second quarter and only a modest third quarter. Summer sales are expected to run 2 to 5 percent ahead of year-earlier volume. Many merchants are less than optimistic simply because they see nothing in the near term to turn the consumer around.
Third District bankers are in agreement that a weak economy, dropping inflation, and a moderation of private credit demands will continue to draw interest rates down, with the prime rate, currently at 16 1/2 percent, dropping another 200 to 250 basis points. Estimates of the timing of a trough in interest rates range from June to September. As the economy turns the corner, rates are expected to start climbing again, unless a solution to the Federal budget dilemma becomes apparent. The recent bulge in Ml is expected to work itself out with little permanent effect on interest rates.
Deposit flows at area banks have held up surprisingly well in 1982, despite weakness in the economy and market rates still running well above passbook and statement savings yields. Demand deposits have dropped only slightly from high year-end levels, while total time and savings have grown. The only explanation offered for the apparent insensitivity of savings to interest rates has been that the precautionary demand for money has increased in the last few months.
