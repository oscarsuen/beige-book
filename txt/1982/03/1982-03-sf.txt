The Twelfth District economy has slipped deeper into recession since the last report. Consumer spending has remained at the slow post-Christmas holiday level reached in January and is running below the year-ago level in real terms. In the manufacturing and mining industries, further cutbacks and layoffs are occurring in a number of industries, although the pace of the overall decline appears to be decelerating. Homebuilding activity has dropped recently, in contrast to the national pattern, and nonresidential construction also is slowing. Agricultural commodity prices have risen slightly during the past month but remain well below the level of a year ago. Respondents expect little or no improvement in net farm income in 1982, following 1981's decline. Bank credit at Twelfth District banks rose sharply in February, but as a result of weakness rather than strength in the regional economy.
