The Twelfth District economy appears to have weakened further in the past month. A late burst of spending pushed December retail sales moderately ahead of the year-ago level in nominal terms, but sales still failed to keep up with inflation. Moreover, in January, sales apparently have dropped below the year-ago level in nominal terms. In the manufacturing and mining sectors, further production cutbacks and layoffs are evident among a broad spectrum of industries. Residential construction rose in December, but builders are skeptical that the improvement will be sustained, given the recent rise in mortgage interest rates. Apparently the region s supply of unsold homes actually has increased recently, contrary to the pattern elsewhere. Farmers are experiencing a continuing decline in commodity prices and are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain credit. Commercial loan demand at banks increased in December but not because of increased confidence but to finance excess inventory. Regional banks are becoming increasingly worried about the creditworthiness of borrowers. At regional S&Ls, mortgage lending continues to be very slow, with no significant improvement in savings flows to the industry.
