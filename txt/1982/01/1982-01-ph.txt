Reports from the Third District indicate that business activity in the month of January is down, but hold some hope for improvement by July. Manufacturers report further slippage in the industrial sector, but are optimistic about the future, anticipating a general upswing in manufacturing activity by summer. Retailers say sales are down from a year ago, but write off the slowness to the cold weather. Third District bankers report C&I loan volume up from last January, but consumer loans are off substantially. Contacts in the financial sector are forecasting modest increases in business loan volume as the economy picks up, but disagree on exactly where interest rates are heading.
The continued slowdown has not put a damper on manufacturers' forecasts, however, as approximately three-quarters of the survey participants anticipate improvement in general industrial activity within the next six months. Over two-thirds of the respondents expect new orders and shipments to take off between now and July, and, as production picks up, manufacturers foresee increases in payrolls along with longer working hours. Survey respondents continue to be cautious, however, and many plan to keep a lid on stock levels. Capital expenditures will be kept to a minimum in coming months as well.
On the inflation front, industrial prices are up again in January but price hikes appear to be softening. Almost two-thirds of the survey participants report stable input costs in January, and nearly three-quarters say they've kept the prices on their finished products the same as in December. Prices are expected to climb over the next six months, though. Close to 8 out of 10 of those polled anticipate paying more for raw materials by July and about 6 out of 10 plan price hikes for the goods they sell.
Looking ahead, area retailers expect sales to begin gaining momentum by the end of the second quarter, if a recovery gets underway, as they expect, but shopkeepers are planning cautiously. Contacts project sales over the next six months to run only slightly ahead of last year's levels, about 5 percent. Inventories remain in-line with no changes in stock levels planned as local retailers may be waiting for stronger signals on the economy before building inventories.
Reports of deposit flows indicate that demand deposits are mixed, running 8 percent below to 10 percent above January '81 levels. Local bankers say depositors continue to watch the rates closely waiting to shift their deposits to higher yielding accounts. Time and savings deposits are running 7 percent ahead of year-ago levels and are expected to continue climbing.
Third District bankers are currently quoting a prime rate of 15 3/4 percent. Projections of the prime over the next six months are mixed; some bankers predict a hike in the rate to over 16 percent, while others forecast the rate to drop by 175 to 275 basis points.
Despite aggressive marketing efforts by banks in the last few weeks, response to IRA offerings has been sluggish so far in the Third District. Currently, deposits average between $1,000 and $1,200 with 30 to 50 percent of the deposits representing new money. Local bankers are optimistic, anticipating some pickup in IRA deposits over the next six months with the strongest thrust coming from corporate payroll deductions.
On the construction side, activity appears to be mixed. No new starts on detached single homes are reported, although contacts say new groundbreakings for condominiums in the Philadelphia area are picking up.
