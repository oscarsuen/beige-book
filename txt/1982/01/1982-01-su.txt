According to this month's district reports, economic activity in the nation remains very weak. Retail sales, after finishing 1981 with a robust performance, have sagged again, and prospects for a quick recovery are not widely perceived. Auto sales are down across the country. In the manufacturing sector, softness cuts across geographic and industry lines, as unwanted stock piles up and leads to production cutbacks. Financial institutions say business loan demand continues to be strong, but consumer borrowing is still in the doldrums. Deposit flows are mixed, and response to IRAs has been disappointing for the most part. The housing market is universally acknowledged to be depressed, and will probably remain so until interest rates come down and the economy picks up, according to builders and brokers. Finally, reports from the agricultural sector indicate falling commodity prices, with farmland prices dropping too, as many farmers find it impossible to stay in business.
Looking ahead, retailers around the country do not seem to expect much from the first half of 1982. Although contacts in Kansas City and Philadelphia are optimistic, they are exceptions. Most other districts say merchants expect the current sluggishness to continue at least through the first quarter, and possibly through the first half of the year.
Auto sales are depressed nationwide. The recession has combined with high interest rates to give auto dealers their worst year in many. There is some hope for improvement though, should price reductions follow the General Motors-United Auto Workers negotiations. That might be good news for consumers, but, as noted by St. Louis, could put a squeeze on used car dealers if price cuts in that market follow.
Deposit flows are mixed. S&Ls continue to have trouble attracting money in most areas. The response to IRA plans has been sluggish in most districts, despite heavy promotion in some parts of the country, and banks that have experienced a strong demand for IRA deposits have often found very little new money going into them.
As for the future, reactions are mixed. While most real estate businesspeople agree that a large drop in mortgage rates will have to proceed any increase in demand, there is also some feeling that that alone won't be enough. Public confidence in the economy may have to be restored, through general economic improvement, before a housing recovery is seen.
Commercial construction, while sluggish in some areas, is generally better than residential, and is even reported to be strong in Dallas.
