A large domestic automobile dealer notes that his sales in the first 19 days of January were the worst he has ever experienced. Sales are retarded by high interest rates and customers waiting for price reductions from GM/UAW negotiations. Another dealer of both domestic and foreign automobiles reports that traffic in his import showroom has slowed as much as in his domestic showroom.
