Despite a few bright spots, the Ninth District economy remained fairly depressed in December and early January. Spending on general merchandise, autos, and homes was still weak; most manufacturing orders and production declined further; the forest products and iron mining industries remained depressed; and farm income was hurt once again by falling prices. Reflecting these weaknesses in economic activity was bank lending, which was still very slow. The district had only three positive signs: the winter sports industry was still thriving, high technology manufacturing seemed to be expanding, and the iron mining industry, although still depressed, resumed some operations.
Sales of autos and homes remained weak too. According to regional sales managers for two of the largest selling domestic automobiles, new car sales were depressed throughout 1981, and they did not revive in early January. The two managers said their new car sales dropped 16 and 21 percent in 1981. Also, Bank directors reported that home sales in the district remained very weak in December and early January.
Spending on winter sports, however, continued to be very strong. Snow conditions at both the western and the eastern ends of the district have been excellent this winter, and ski area operators indicated that their business was quite a bit better than usual. One large ski lodge in northern Minnesota, for example, reported that in December its business was up 21 percent from a year ago.
The forest products and iron mining industries remained depressed as well, but iron mining recently showed signs of improvement. Directors from Montana, northern Minnesota, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan reported that the forest products industry was still very depressed in December and early January. During this period, production at taconite (iron ore) plants was down considerably from earlier years. According to Bank directors, however, several plants that were closed in November and December recently resumed operations.
The recent weakening in most industrial activity has been accompanied by an increase in initial claims for unemployment insurance. In Minnesota, for example, these claims, seasonally adjusted, rose 7 percent between November and December and another 5 percent in early January.
