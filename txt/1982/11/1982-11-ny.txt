Reports from business leaders throughout the Second District suggested that the region's economy has stopped declining though concrete signs of an upturn remained limited. Retail sales exhibited some sluggishness at the beginning of October but improved modestly in recent weeks. Although residential building was still at depressed levels, builders have turned more optimistic. Nonresidential construction activity continued strong. In manufacturing, further layoffs occurred but at a greatly reduced rate. Even with some emerging signs of stabilization in the District's economy, few of our business leaders foresaw an immediate upturn. Concern over the future course of interest rates was voiced by a wide range of our contacts.
Nonresidential construction activity continued strong as a result of projects currently underway, but announcements of major new projects were still scarce. Nevertheless, respondents felt that an upturn was closer at hand. Even though the office market in the suburbs remained soft, Manhattan experienced a small but definite increase in leasing activity, the first such increase in over six months. Moreover, office rents have stopped slipping and the amount of vacant space did not increase.
Auerbach: Saw no prospects for a significant recovery unless interest rates fall much further. Even if that should happen soon, the impetus to greater output would not take effect before the second quarter of next year. So it is unlikely that 1983 will turn out to be strong.
Olcay: Echoed similar thoughts. An immediate cut in short-term interest rates of about 2 percentage points is both warranted and necessary for any recovery to begin. The risks in terms of inflationary expectations are minimal, because the European economies are very weak and will not snap back until a U.S. recovery is well underway (by which time the Federal Reserve can again safely target Ml). So commodity markets will not tighten. Olcay put particular emphasis on the dollar's strength, which has severely eroded U.S. export competitiveness. It means that the domestic economy will have to grow by 1-2 percent just to keep overall GNP level.
