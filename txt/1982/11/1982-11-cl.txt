A major producer of household consumables says their real sales were up in the third quarter and that the consumer is buying. A major producer of consumer electrical durables reports a sharp rise in early October orders compared with a year ago, following months of declines. An official with a large department store reports that recent improvement in sales has prompted officials to raise their near-term sales forecasts from September.
Automobile and capital goods sales are weak. A major auto manufacturer reports domestic producers have reduced their fourth quarter planned output to a 4-3/4 million unit annual rate. According to a major capital goods producer, orders are weak, and no pickup is expected until the second quarter. He says output of capital goods is falling more than capital spending because export sales are falling more sharply, in response to strong appreciation of the dollar. A diversified producer of capital goods expects his real sales to decline 8.7 percent (a.r.) in the fourth quarter and rise 14.4 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter, after which they will still be 25 percent below the level of four years ago.
The steel industry is in great distress. A major steel firm asserts that falling auto production and extreme weakness in capital goods output are undermining steel consumption and extending the period of customer inventory liquidation. Steel mills are closing plants to cut costs and lengthen the time span before huge operating losses produce financial collapse. An early cyclical recovery in the economy is essential to preserve the viability of the U.S. steel industry. Another steel firm expects no increase in steel consumption in 1983, but thinks shipments will improve because steel user inventories will stop falling.
Some firms are obtaining labor cost concessions. A major manufacturer of aircraft and automotive components obtained givebacks worth $1.77 per hour in a new three-year contract. A large producer of machine tools obtained substantial givebacks in a three-year contract for one plant and gave no pledges of job security. Workers at another automotive parts manufacturer recently authorized union leaders to open concessions negotiations with the company. Most major steel firms in the Fourth District have imposed 5 percent to 10 percent pay reductions on non-union, salaried workers.
