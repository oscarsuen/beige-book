Autumn economic conditions in the Sixth District remain weak. Most sectors of the labor market continue to deteriorate. Consumer spending has risen only slightly, and the outlook for the Christmas season is mixed. Falling crop prices continue to augur lower farm income, but poultry prospects have improved. Tourism is still off in many areas, but EPCOT is generating widespread optimism. With sustained improvements in residential building and real estate, construction remains the brightest spot in the southeastern economy.
Nonfarm employment is still declining. Even in "growth" sectors, including services, trade, finance, and transportation, job expansion is decelerating. Expressions of concern over the shutdown of the Woolco chain are widespread. Most retailers polled plan to increase hours of part-time employees rather than hire more workers for the Christmas season. Public sector employment, although still declining, is not falling as rapidly as earlier, but some of our contacts expect more reductions at the state level. Construction employment has yet to reflect lower mortgage rates. Anecdotes of applicants far outnumbering positions typically accompany reports of job openings.
Manufacturing shows virtually no evidence of a turnaround. The rate of year-to-year declines increased in September, and our directors and others report additional layoffs in October in chemicals, primary and fabricated metals, transportation equipment, and machinery, including computers and other electronics. The number of new manufacturing facilities over $0.5 million declined 40 percent through August compared to the first eight months of last year. Factory expansions were down over 45 percent. Contacts at state economic development agencies report that low utilization rates have prompted manufacturers to do only maintenance and efficiency construction and to shelve new construction plans until solid signs of recovery appear.
Except for poultry, conditions in the livestock industry have changed little in recent weeks. Both egg and broiler prices have increased although egg prices remain 27 percent below year-ago levels. Lower feed costs and higher prices have improved the outlook for poultry farmers. Large supplies of corn and soybeans now being harvested continue to depress prices of these crops. Without high yields or low costs the prospect for breaking even on these two crops looks doubtful. Tobacco, sugarcane, and peanuts appear to offer the greatest opportunity for profit.
