With widespread excess capacity, weak prices and pared inventories, some believe the conditions are now ripe for recovery. Others, however, are afraid that higher interest rates next year will continue to curtail economic activity and prolong the recession. There appears to be more economic strength in the North East than elsewhere, with the Boston, New York and Philadelphia Districts reporting strength in the business of their defense contractors, high technology manufacturers, finance and other service companies. Though some weakening in the high technology industry is evident there and in other Districts, defense-related business is expanding everywhere. One positive sign is the pervasive weakening of prices, which indicates continued low levels of inflation. It remains to be seen whether the moderating decline of business activity is indeed a precursor of the long-expected recovery.

Most institutions are preparing to offer the new money market account, but express concern about the likely increase in their cost of funds.
