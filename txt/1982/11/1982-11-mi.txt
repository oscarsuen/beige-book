Since July, open market interest rates have declined substantially and equity values have made record gains. So far, the effects of these national developments on the Ninth District have been restricted primarily to financial variables. District commercial, consumer, and mortgage loan rates have fallen, and some local corporations have begun taking advantage of improved market conditions to clean up their balance sheets.
Some sketchy evidence has emerged, however, that interest rate and wealth effects have started to carry over into the real sector. In particular, auto sales have shown some responsiveness to improved financing terms, and more would-be home buyers have been actively shopping (if not buying, as yet). Nevertheless, October home, auto, and general merchandise sales remained weak by historical standards. District manufacturing, metal mining, and lumbering continued in the same depressed condition reported in the last several Redbooks. On district farms, falling commodity prices and poor weather still were causing distress.
Interest rate declines have not increased business borrowing from district banks, but rather, district corporations have stepped up their borrowing in primary securities markets. The lackluster business borrowing from banks reported in recent Redbooks seems to have continued in October. However, representatives of two major investment banking firms say that local firms have recently increased their offerings of debt and equity. A large district leasing and rental company, for example, floated a $100 million debt issue, and equity issues were made by a large retailer and by a food processing company. The investment bankers indicate that the proceeds of these issues will be used primarily to refinance short-term debt, not to fund new plant and equipment expenditures. Furthermore, they say that many other local firms are planning to offer more debt and equity if market conditions remain favorable.
The decline in interest rates also seems to have increased consumer borrowing somewhat. An official of the nation's third largest mortgage banker, headquartered in this district, says that its residential mortgage applications rose 6 percent between July and August and 16 percent between August and September. The district's largest S&L reports that, in the week ending October 25, it received 54 applications for fixed rate mortgage loans as compared to 16 in the week ending a month earlier. This S&L has been heavily advertising for consumer loans and reports a doubling in the number of such loans extended over the last 30 days. The district's two largest banks report that consumer lending has not risen much in the last month or so, but that inquiries are up significantly.
General merchandise sales also have remained weak in the Ninth District, according to this Bank's directors and Minneapolis-St. Paul retailers. However, two Twin Cities retailers indicate that furniture and appliances (reported weak in previous Redbooks) showed some signs of improvement in October. This improvement is attributed to price cutting and heavy advertising, though, not to reduced finance charges.
The metal mining and lumbering industries generally have continued to operate at low production levels. Minnesota's largest taconite plant, shut down in June, was supposed to resume operations later this year. It recently announced, however, that it will not reopen until "sometime in 1983." Reflecting the continuing weakness in lumbering, a large district railroad reports that in September, forest product shipments were 31 percent below those a year ago. One hopeful sign for the lumber industry is a Minnesota director's report that the state's production of wafer board (an inexpensive substitute for plywood) increased in September and October.
