The Twelfth District economy remains entrenched in recession. Consumer spending is not leading the recovery, despite the tax cut, while unemployment is rising. Residential construction is still depressed, and non-residential construction is now slowing down in many areas of the District. The lumber industry continues to suffer from mill closures, layoffs, low prices, and foreign competition. Metal prices are still too low to reopen any closed mines. In agriculture, low crop prices are contributing to low farm incomes, and unseasonable rains recently caused large losses for some California crops. Depository institutions appear to be gaining funds with new types of deposit accounts, but the large amount of funds coming due in balloon-payment mortgages is a major concern among financial institutions. A survey of Twelfth District Directors indicates that unemployment is almost universally expected to increase further on both a national and regional basis, but the recent rise in bond and stock prices are seen by some as an optimistic sign.
