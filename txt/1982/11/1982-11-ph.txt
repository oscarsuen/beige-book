Reports from the Third District in November point to mixed local economic conditions. Manufacturing is showing signs of a hiatus after a short recovery in October, but retail sales have perked up somewhat. Mixed loan activity is reported by area bankers. Mortgage rates have dropped, giving the housing sector a boost.
Third District businessmen are very cautious about the prospects for improvement over the next six months. A weak recovery is expected in the manufacturing sector while a moderate pickup is expected in retailing. Bankers foresee lower interest rates and slipping business loan demand.
Looking ahead, respondents are still very optimistic that expansion in the industrial sector will resume over the next six months. Almost four out of five participants project a strengthening in general activity between now and May, characterized by widespread gains in new orders and shipments, along with growing backlogs. But there is little feeling that inventory rebuilding is in the picture yet. Plans for capital spending remain weak, emphasizing respondents' caution regarding the recovery.
The prices firms charge for their own products dropped marginally in both October and November, the first price cuts in area manufacturing since the end of the 1973-75 recession. Input costs, on the other hand, remain largely unchanged from their September levels. Manufacturers predict that between now and May, as the industrial sector rebuilds, prices of both raw materials and finished goods will begin to rise again.
Retail contacts continue to be cautious about sales over the coming months. The present uptempo buying is expected to continue through mid-December, when a brisk holiday season should kick in. Gains for 1982 on the whole, however, are projected to be on the order of only three to four percent. Merchants foresee a slow pickup continuing into the second quarter of 1983, resulting in sales two to six percent above year-earlier volume by May.
Retail inventories have been kept trim in response to the slow activity prevalent through most of this year, and are now slightly below last year's levels. Retailers have no plans to alter stock levels in the near term.
Bankers are forecasting a continuation of present trends in area lending over the next six months, depending on the strength and timing of the expected recovery. Less distress borrowing and increased reliance on the corporate bond market should soften business loan demand even further. Consumer borrowing will probably grow strongly, according to contacts, as both lenders and borrowers find retail loans more attractive.
The prime rate at Third District banks has dropped to 12 percent from 13.50 percent in September. A downward trend is expected to pull the prime down as far as 10 percent sometime late in the second quarter of 1983 before it firms up. Other lending rates at area banks, including mortgage rates, are expected to follow suit.
Deposit flows in the Third District appear healthy in November. Demand deposits are up sharply since September; bankers attribute this jump to slow reinvestment of maturing All Savers' dollars. Time deposits have improved as well, especially the new 7-31 day time deposits, and are now as high as 14 percent above last year at this time.
