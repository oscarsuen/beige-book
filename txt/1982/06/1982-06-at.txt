Growing evidence suggests the District economy is in a moderate upturn. Employment is edging higher, although some sectors remain weak. Unemployment rates have declined slightly in most areas. Consumer spending is up moderately. However, high long-term interest rates are depressing the housing and housing-related industries as well as the farm sector.
Auto sales in May in the District were generally off from May of last year but up from levels of mid-1981 and early 1982. The geographic pattern of sales within the District is consistent with geographic differences in the severity of the recession; Atlanta car sales are strong compared to agriculturally-depressed South Georgia. Full-size cars continue their recent gain of market share at the expense of compact cars; however, the recent increase in the price of gasoline may soon reverse this trend. Auto dealers are fearful that high interest rates will limit future sales levels.
Strength in bank lending is reported to be largely distress borrowing related to the recession. Firms are avoiding the long-term credit market because of high interest rates and are using short-term bank credit to finance operating costs. In Florida, some firms are continuing to borrow to relocate businesses to the region. The Mississippi area had little strength in bank loans from any source.
A slight upturn in employment is also evident in slightly lower unemployment rates in the region. Unemployment rates declined in April in five of the six states in the District, with Georgia experiencing the largest decline. Although Alabama's unemployment rate edged up, the increase was marginal when compared to previous months. Florida's jobless rate fell in April despite a decline in employment as labor force growth slowed in response to the reduced inflow of people from outside the state. Florida and Georgia are the only two states in the six-state region with single-digit unemployment rates. These two states, however, comprise a large portion of the area's population and labor force. Thus movement in their rates has an important influence on the region's job picture.
There are signs of a turnaround in the south Louisiana petroleum industry due to higher crude oil prices and the potential for greater demand. Well financed oil drillers and related operations see opportunities to expand as the surplus is consumed. Streamlined regulations regarding offshore drilling have stimulated drilling activity, particularly in the Mobile Bay area.
The textile industry, a major portion of which is based in the Southeast, has been affected by the recession. However, production has bottomed out and a very gradual revival is expected to begin in August after normal July plant closings. Products tied to autos and housing have been doing more poorly than other segments of the industry and are expected to recover more slowly. Personal consumer products are considered most likely to lead the rest of the textile industry out of the recession.
With few exceptions, acreage for the major crops is down 10 to 15 percent from last year's. Peanut acreage is down even more, 20 to 30 percent. But these acreage reductions do not necessarily portend a drop in production. The highly favorable weather and soil moisture conditions which exist throughout the District may result in production near that of last year. Clearly, if such is the case, there will be less upward pressure on farm prices.
