Reductions in mining activity are widespread. Minneapolis reports sharp curtailment of iron and copper output, a modest reduction in coal production, and oil and gas drilling activity at less than half the year-ago level. Dallas reports oil drilling rates are low, but increased slightly at the beginning of June. San Francisco reports copper and silver mine production at 50 percent of capacity.
The outlook for commercial construction is weakening. New York and Chicago report postponements of new projects and Dallas reports a decline in the number of new project announcements. Softening in office rental markets is reported by New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco.
Business loan demand is reported strong in some Districts and weak in others. Where strong, it is variously described as distress borrowing and as a substitute for tapping the bond market, but there is little indication of borrowing for plant expansion. Several Districts report bankers are concerned with the quality of existing loans and are very cautious about the quality of new credits. Delinquencies have risen, and San Francisco reports concern about the "level of nonperforming business loans, particularly to the construction, forest products and aerospace industries."
