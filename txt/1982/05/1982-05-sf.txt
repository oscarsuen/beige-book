The Twelfth District economic recession does not appear to have ended. The general pattern of economic activity since the last report has continued to be downward. Consumer spending during the Easter season was disappointing, with sales in April just about matching the year-ago pace, representing a decline in real terms. In the manufacturing and mining sectors, a number of industries are undergoing a new wave of production cutbacks. The only notable improvement in sales has occurred in electronic equipment. Homebuilding has picked up recently, but the continued decline in home sales suggests the recovery may not be sustained. Storms have inflicted serious damage on the California agriculture industry, and crop prices generally remain below the level of a year ago. Bank credit growth at Twelfth District banks has slowed considerably since February, as the weakness in the regional economy and the heavy debt burden of borrowers has stifled business loan demand.
