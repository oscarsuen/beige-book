Economic activity in the Second District remained lackluster during April. Major retailers reported that consumer spending was weaker than expected. New residential construction continued to languish although some brokers noted a few signs of modest improvement. Nonresidential building was still brisk but there was softening in the office rental market. Widespread layoffs were noted in the manufacturing sector. Except for the defense industry, few firms experienced any increase in new orders. While the region's unemployment rate remained below the nation's, business leaders expressed growing concern that the recession would spread to more sectors of the region's economy.
Nonresidential construction activity remained strong with work continuing on many new office buildings. At the same time, however, the rental market for office space has softened throughout the District, perhaps foreshadowing a future fall-off in new construction projects. In New York City, for example, landlords granted more concessions to prospective tenants, including slower escalation of rents and more structural improvements. Space available for subleasing rose significantly as firms which had been holding the space deferred expansion plans. One just-completed building had been entirely pre-leased a year ago, but almost a third of its space was again available. Outside of New York City, rents also stabilized, and in western Connecticut, leasing during the first quarter was the lowest in five years. Respondents believed, however, that the slowdown was only temporary.
As for the price outlook, there was little feel for whether the recent price slowdown was cyclical or permanent. A number of respondents echoed the sentiment that, "We'd prefer to go back to the good old days when the economy was expanding even if that meant higher inflation." Wage settlements are now lower than a year ago; for example, central New York firms are projecting overall increases 1 1/2 percentage points below last year's average of 9 percent.
Riefler: The Fed should begin to modify its monetarist approach because of the poor correlation between Ml as currently defined and nominal growth in the economy. An acceptable range of "real" interest rates should be developed as a policy guide in addition to monetary targets. Federal Reserve credibility would not suffer from this adjustment.
Schott: Institutional cash flow remains severely constrained by high interest rates. Improvement in Federal budget prospects is essential, although a modest decline in rates is widely anticipated anyway because of the recession and favorable inflation figures.
Federal Reserve policy continues to be appropriate. Despite much carping over the level of interest rates and over technical points of monetary policy, responsible executives see no credible alternative to moderate restraint on the aggregates.
Wojnilower: The contraction in business activity appears to be near a bottom. Capital spending is being cut sharply but the decline in other final demand has probably ended.
Far too much is being made of the near term impact of the Budget on interest rates. The behavior of longer term interest rates over the next few months will be mainly governed by perceptions of the business outlook. It is unlikely that these perceptions will be significantly influenced by the Budget debate.
