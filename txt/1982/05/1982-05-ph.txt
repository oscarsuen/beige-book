Reports from the Third District in May continue to point to a bottoming out of the slump, but hard signs of a pickup are scarce. Manufacturers say industrial activity is flat in May, compared to a month ago, and industrial prices reflect that softness. This is the third straight month in which manufacturing activity has remained unchanged. Retail business, on the other hand, is showing some signs of life after an illness that lasted through the winter and early spring. An announcement of total recovery for the retail sector, however, is still premature. Bankers say business is mixed.
As for the outlook, Third District contacts are reasonably optimistic. Manufacturers are predicting an upturn within six months, and retail merchants expect sales to continue at their current pace through summer. Bankers are forecasting falling interest rates through the third quarter, but weakness in commercial borrowing.
Looking ahead, Outlook Survey participants continue to forecast gains. Nearly 70 percent of the respondents say the general business climate will improve within six months; climbing new orders and shipments are projected by a similar portion. Concomitant with the expected expansion are plans to hire more workers and lengthen the workweek. Only marginal inventory building is in the picture, though, and capital spending plans are very weak for the second consecutive month.
Industrial prices in the Third District remain generally stable in May. Prices paid by manufacturers for raw materials are up only very marginally over last month, and prices received for finished goods are virtually flat. There are reports of price cuts in both categories. As for the future, survey participants think prices will pick up with the projected recovery. About half expect input costs to be higher six months from now, while a third are planning price hikes for the goods they sell.
Local merchants remain cautious about the coming months. There is some feeling that both the July 1 tax cut and the July Social Security increase will be used by consumers to restore liquidity and will therefore be of little help to retailers. Sales are expected to continue at about their current pace at least through midsummer. A tight rein will still be held on inventories, however, and they'll be kept at their current trim levels.
Local bankers are currently quoting a prime rate of 16 percent, and see further cuts on the horizon. Most contacts anticipate a trough between 14 and 15.5 percent in the prime sometime in the third quarter. After that, they say, they expect a continuing hard line policy by the Fed to put upward pressure on rates again.
Deposit flows at Third District banks have pretty much worked through the usual April seasonal problems, and are now showing firmness which some bankers have termed "surprising." Demand deposits are slightly higher than they were a year ago, and savings are up sharply. Neither the new 91-day money market certificate nor the new 3 1/2 year certificate can be credited with that strength, however. Consumer response to both of those instruments has been very weak. Bankers feel that savers still prefer money market funds to the 91-day certificate, and that 3 1/2 years is too long-term for most depositors at this point.
