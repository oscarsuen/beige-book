As for the price outlook, there was little feel for whether the recent slowdown was cyclical or permanent. In Chicago, price discounting is more common than at any time since the l930s and is especially prevalent in steel, nonferrous metals, building materials, paper, and transportation, though a large surge in these prices is anticipated with recovery. Similarly, in Kansas City, prices for new materials were down between 5 and 18 percent from last year but are expected to be stable or rise slightly for the rest of the year. Wage settlements not far below those of a year ago were reported by several Districts. For example some Chicago firms in depressed industries recently negotiated contracts calling for 8 to 10 percent first year wage increases.
