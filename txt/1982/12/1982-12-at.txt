Late fall economic conditions in the Southeast show mixed signs. Construction continues to improve, generating optimism among construction-related manufacturers. The labor market appears to be stabilizing, and job growth in some sectors is accelerating. Optimism prevails in the travel industry. However, the profit potential for most farmers remains clouded and consumer spending has yet to show a pre-Christmas surge.
Our survey of firms and trade associations reveals moderate optimism among producers of construction-related goods, such as lumber and carpets, and among makers of structural steel. The latter expect government spending on defense and infrastructure to stimulate demand. However, chemical manufacturers do not share this optimism. Even in industries with capital spending plans, job creation is likely to be minimal because the impetus is cost-cutting efficiency rather than growth-related expansion.
Southeastern auto sales slightly outpaced the nation's rise of 31 percent in November. Cut-rate loans are successfully stimulating sales and helping to reduce car inventories. Nevertheless, the short-term sales outlook is not bright because consumers remain troubled by rising unemployment and high real interest rates.
Thrifts have been slow to accrue benefits from the housing recovery, but total loans closed by S&L's have finally begun to improve. Industry spokesmen attribute the delayed recovery of thrifts vis-a-vis other construction indicators to increased competition from seller financing and mortgage companies and to a longer "wait and see" period by home buyers.
Most grain farmers face only a small chance of profit from the 1982 crop, notwithstanding a recent 5 percent rise in prices. At present, widespread flooding in the Mississippi valley has done little injury to crops, but potential damage is of concern, and extension personnel in Mississippi report other weather-related damage. Recent aberrations in temperature and a surfeit of rain have adulterated the quality of the remaining soybean harvest. One estimate suggests a possible loss of 10 million bushels, valued at approximately $52 million. Large supplies have thwarted efforts to sell low- quality beans.
