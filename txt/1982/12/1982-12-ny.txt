In recent weeks the Second District economy showed a few signs of improvement, but the manufacturing sector remained depressed. Promotions sparked early holiday shopping in the District and resulted in a further strengthening of retail sales. Declining mortgage rates produced a modest rise in home sales, and builders were cautiously optimistic about further growth. Recent developments in the nonresidential real estate market were mixed, but some improvement did occur on balance. In manufacturing, however, business leaders saw no pickup and reported increasing pessimism about the short-run outlook.
The nonresidential real estate market also improved but demand for space continued weak in many areas of the District. Activity and planning by office developers increased in midtown New York City even as the downtown market remained soft. The pattern was also mixed in the suburbs: leasing activity was up in New Jersey and new construction occurred in Westchester and Long Island, while in Connecticut the slow pace of previous months persisted. Industrial construction remained depressed throughout the District, although some pickup was reported on Long Island.
Maude: A sustained economic recovery cannot get under way unless interest rates are brought down further. However, the Fed is running out of leeway for bringing down these rates by pushing down the funds rate and the discount rate. The credibility issue is growing and will become more real once the markets see signs of economic recovery. To bring rates down in a credible fashion, the Fed should quantify publicly to the markets the magnitude of precautionary balance building that has bloated M-l over the past year, go back to shift adjusting other checkable deposits and come up with 1983 M-l targets more realistic with trend changes in velocity and M-2 targets that net out the bloating of interest-crediting to those components earning market rates of interest.
Riefler: There is a real danger that the specter of higher interest costs that may be incurred by banks in competing for deposits in new DIDC authorized accounts will slow banks' willingness to reduce lending rates. This in turn may delay the rebound in consumer spending that would be normal at this stage of the business cycle.
Schott: Signs of revival in housing and automobiles and improved cash flow at thrifts and life insurance companies raise the question whether the Fed has done enough to stimulate recovery. An evaluation period may be appropriate. Nevertheless the number and extent of trouble situations domestically and internationally suggest that the indirect assistance of a further easing of credit conditions may well be advisable.
