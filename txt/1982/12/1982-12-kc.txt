Officers at Tenth District Savings and Loan Associations generally report little or no change in savings inflows compared to a year ago, but they expect increased activity in the near future. The introduction of money market deposit accounts is the primary source of their optimism. Most officers report recent improvement in the demand for mortgage funds and mortgage commitments, but a minority report continuing slack demand. Additional increases are expected, assuming continued declines in interest rates, but with no significant additional activity before spring. Loans are being made at interest rates of 12 1/2 to 14 5/8 percent, and further slight declines are expected.
