The economy of the Twelfth District appears to have slipped more deeply into recession. Unemployment rates generally rose during November and the District as a whole posts a higher unemployment rate than the national average. Although declines in interest rates have spurred residential construction permit activity (substantially in some cases) the industry is operating at such levels that little absolute stimulus has been felt as a result. The lumber mills in the District are suffering from the combined impact of the continued reduced domestic and foreign demand, and costly timber cutting obligations. Retail sales have been disappointing thus far and conventionally strong industries—such as aerospace and electronics—are experiencing major layoffs. Motor car manufacturing is sagging under the announcement of further plant closures. Financial institutions in the region report deposit outflows or only weak deposit growth except in the high-yield money-market type accounts and loan demand has been flat.
