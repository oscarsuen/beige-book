Survey respondents indicate continuing gains in general retail sales but no great strength in automobile demand.
The manufacturing sector continues to register advances, with manufacturing respondents reporting further increases in shipments, new orders, backlogs, employment, and hours worked per week.
Results of a special survey of inventory plans suggest that both manufacturers and retailers are currently in the process of making small to moderate increases in their inventory positions.
Bankers, however, report no notable improvement in inventory loans or in business loan demand in general.
On the other hand, consumer and real estate loans remain strong.
Compared with recent surveys, an unusually large fraction of manufacturers in our latest survey report increases in new orders and backlogs.
A smaller fraction indicate increases in shipments, employment and hours worked per week.
