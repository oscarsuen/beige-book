Near-term prospects for both consumer spending and business investment continue to be excellent.
Strong income gains in the agricultural sector are bolstering retail trade and outlays for farm machinery and equipment.

Concern about the reemergence of inflation during 1973 was the most frequently mentioned problem on the economic horizon.
Banks specifically commenting on the problem of renewed inflation include Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis.
On the subject of controls, Atlanta mentioned that businessmen are concerned about the inadequacies of wage-price controls, while St. Louis reported reservations among businessmen regarding the future effectiveness of controls.
A comment picked up by New York was that continued wage controls (but presumably not price controls) seem to be a "necessary evil" if the problem of cost-push inflation is to be solved.

Banks generally reported that retail sales continued to register strong growth in recent weeks.

In Chicago, excellent consumer demand for recreational vehicles has spurred producers to expand capacity.
Farm machinery producers in the Chicago District are pleased with domestic and foreign demand and plan to operate at a higher level than normal during the winter.

Business economists in the Cleveland District do not expect a credit crunch to materialize in 1973, although they anticipate some edging up of interest rates.
