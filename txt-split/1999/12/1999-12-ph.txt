Manufacturing Manufacturing activity in the Third District continued on an upward trend in November.
On balance, industrial firms reported increases in shipments and orders during the month.
Gains were common among nearly all the major goods-producing sectors in the region.

Order backlogs at plants in the region have been steady, overall.
Manufacturers' inventories of raw materials and supplies rose slightly in November.
A few firms indicated they had ordered increased quantities of critical inputs to ensure continued operation in the event of supply interruptions related to possible Y2K problems.
Besides the firms that have already added to inventories, other firms indicated that they plan to boost inventories closer to the end of the year.
For firms that have already added to inventories and those that plan to, the increased amounts represent around one week's supply of those inputs.
Third District manufacturers generally expect growth to continue at about its current pace during the next six months.
Although some firms forecast increases in their order backlogs, most expect to be able to meet rising demand for their products without delays in filling orders.
Expectations of price increases persist.
Nearly half of the firms surveyed in November anticipate paying higher prices for inputs in the next six months, and one-fourth plan to raise prices for the products they make.

Toys, recorded music, jewelry, and apparel other than winter coats were the best-selling items as the Christmas shopping period began.
Auto dealers said sales have slowed recently but remain well above last year's pace.
The slowdown is seasonal, according to the dealers; they expect a pickup after the year-end holidays.

Some banks posted modest increases in consumer lending, mainly home equity and auto loans, but residential real estate lending eased generally at area banks.
Commercial and industrial loan volume has been virtually flat, on balance, at banks in the region.
Several bank lending officers said they believe many business borrowers arranged bank financing earlier than usual this year in order to avoid any delays that might occur if Y2K problems materialize.
Bankers expect loan demand to pick up in January, but they do not forecast a strong increase.

Rental rates have risen since the beginning of the year, but appeared to be leveling off.
