Port activity varied by commodity, while trucking shipments rose modestly, compared to recent months, but remained below last year's level.
Travel and tourism grew moderately, with particular strength in business travel.
In addition, retailers reported moderate growth in sales as holiday shopping was even with or above the year-ago level.
Home sales and mortgage lending remained fairly strong, as were commercial real estate leasing and construction.

The demand for labor remained strong across skill levels, and wage increases were moderate.
Price growth picked up slightly for services, but remained muted, overall.
Employment and Wages The demand for labor remained strong in recent weeks and businesses continued to report labor shortages across skill levels.
The tight labor market led some firms to increase benefits and wages, ease background screening requirements, and invest in labor-saving technology.
To retain workers, firms have increased wages, training, and talent development.
Overall, wage increases were moderate with some larger raises cited for specific job categories, such as electricians and other skilled trades.

Several increased prices of final goods but struggled with low profit margins due to tariffs on raw materials.
Some manufacturers saw strong demand but had output constrained by labor shortages.

Exports of metals and hardware to Europe were weak, but pork exports were strong.
Imports of furniture and other commodities were soft, but auto and apparel imports remained strong.

Retail, Travel, and Tourism Overall, Fifth District travel and tourism grew moderately since our last report.
Business travel was particularly strong.
Hotel rates and occupancy generally remained solid around most of the District amid high demand, even as more rooms opened.
One exception was a hotel in Greenville, South Carolina, that attributed a drop in occupancy to increased supply of both hotels and short-term rental properties.
Additionally, hotels in Charleston, West Virginia, reported low occupancy despite stronger tourism in the state as a whole.
Retailers in the Fifth District reported moderate sales in recent weeks.
Stores had solid customer traffic for the holidays, and many retailers reported that holiday sales were level with or up from last year.
Auto dealers had increasing sales, amid high manufacturer incentives, and noted a shift towards smaller down payments and longer term financing.
Some dealers said that rising costs were leading them to raise prices, and there were mild concerns about tariffs and online competition.
However, other dealers have continued to invest and expand, as they expect to see strong growth in 2020.

Some real estate agents noted an increase in days on the market as home prices rose but said activity is strong overall.

Banking and Finance Overall, loan demand grew slightly in recent weeks.
Bankers said that moderate growth in residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans was due, at least in part, to low rates.
Although some bankers noted that the number of C&I loans in the pipeline rose modestly, a few respondents stated that firms seem to be holding back on capital spending.
On balance, residential refinancing activity, home equity lines, and other consumer loans grew modestly.
Applicant credit quality and loan delinquencies were reportedly unchanged, but bankers reported a slight decline in underwriting standards.

Nonfinancial Services Reports from nonfinancial services firms were mixed.
Universities reported growth in healthcare, IT, and computer science programs.
Also, a health service provider experienced growth and investment in ambulatory and urgent care facilities.
A marketing firm, on the other hand, reported a slowdown that was partly due to the holidays and partly because potential clients were taking a long time to make decisions.
In addition, a couple of firms in D.C. noted that political uncertainties, including a potential government shutdown, hampered demand for IT consulting and teleservices.
Natural Resources Recent reports on the natural resources sector varied.
Agriculture contacts were mostly positive because of good crop yields and solid demand; however, farmers faced tighter profit margins due to low selling prices and rising prices for labor, equipment, and land.
Coal production reportedly picked up slightly, but several firms remain in bankruptcy proceedings.
Finally, the oil and gas industry was negatively affected by low selling prices, excess supply, and stalled pipeline construction.
