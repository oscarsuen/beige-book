One department store executive reported "weak" business in July, while other respondents characterized sales as "good" or "excellent".
Several respondents experiencing brisk sales attributed part of their success to heavy promotional campaigns.

Most contacts were somewhat more reserved in assessing the success of the new certificates.
Echoing the view of many respondents, the chairman of major savings bank held that the certificates had moderated the deposit outflows.
In terms of the impact of the new certificates on the profitability of thrift institutions, respondents at large savings banks felt that the new instruments would raise profits since their mortgage lending is implemented by purchasing pass-through securities at rates that exceed New York's usury ceiling.
There was concern, however, that the profitability of smaller mortgage lenders, which primarily serve local markets, would be adversely affected.
