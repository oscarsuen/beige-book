In New York City, retailers had hoped for a rebound in consumer spending with the end of the newspaper strike in early November.

On the financial scene, senior lending officers at the major New York City banks generally expect stronger business loan demand in the near term.
Although the prime rate has risen considerably in recent months, almost all of the respondents report that they have not tightened either compensating balance requirements or standards of credit worthiness.
Moreover, there generally has not been less willingness to accommodate either established or new business customers.
However, most of the respondents are becoming increasingly hesitant to commit themselves to fixed-rate loans.
