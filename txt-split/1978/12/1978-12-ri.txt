On balance, shipments and new orders rose, but the incidence of declining activity at individual firms or establishments also increased.
Backlogs of orders were unchanged to slightly lower overall.
Inventories, despite scattered reductions, apparently rose relative to desired levels.
Employment and weekly hours worked were basically unchanged at those manufacturers surveyed.

A large majority of the Richmond Directors feels that there is at least a 50-50 chance of a recession developing in 1979. Business lending in the District is seasonally depressed with substantial rundowns in loans to commodity dealers and the wholesale trade sector.

Nonprice terms on loans to businesses have tightened of late, taking the form of firmer compensating balance requirements and limits on approvals of lines of credit to new customers.
