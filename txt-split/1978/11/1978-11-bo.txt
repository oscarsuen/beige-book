One respondent reports that, although there has been a general improvement in the retail sector's inventory position since earlier this year, the industry would still be vulnerable if there were a significant weakening in the economy.
One reason for this concern about retail inventories is that manufacturers and wholesalers are offering retailers very attractive deals, thereby discouraging further reductions, in order to keep their own inventories down.

Professors Houthakker, Eckstein, and Samuelson were available for comment this month.
Although intervention 14 months ago, when urged by our allies, would have been a mistake, the respondents generally agreed that the slide in the dollar had now reached the point that it "could not be allowed to continue" and that "tactically this was a good time for counter-speculation" to "impress on holders of private capital that the Swiss franc and German mark are not a one-way bet."
Houthakker, who had been urging greater gold sales, was generally pleased with the package but does not like the idea of foreign borrowing.
Eckstein argued that the jump in interest rates and the strengthened currency arrangements do nothing to solve the basic problem of the dollar, which can only be corrected by a turnaround in our trade position.
Samuelson disputes the view that a recession is inevitable and the earlier it comes the milder it will be.
To contrive a recession is "playing with brinkmanship" and is not justified by either demand- pull inflation or the level of the dollar.
To honor the President's commitment to support the dollar, it is now appropriate to aim for a somewhat lower real growth target (such as 2 percent).
Houthakker has been impressed by the recent strength of the economy and feels the odds are still against a recession in 1979, although they have increased slightly.
Noting the sharp rise in the weekly wholesale price index, he fears inflation next year in the 9 to 10 percent range.
