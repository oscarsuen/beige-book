In agriculture, low crop prices are contributing to low farm incomes, and unseasonable rains recently caused large losses for some California crops.
Depository institutions appear to be gaining funds with new types of deposit accounts, but the large amount of funds coming due in balloon-payment mortgages is a major concern among financial institutions.

In Oregon, this activity dropped 30 percent in August from July.
In Los Angeles, nonresidential construction has slowed down; some projects have been canceled, including a few that were underway, because long-term financing could not be found.
