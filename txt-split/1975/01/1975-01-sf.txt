Even the pulp and kraft industry, which until recently has been operating near capacity for two years, has been experiencing reduced orders.
In the last six months, one firm reported that volume dropped about 25 percent.
Because paper containers are ordered to meet current production, containers are not stored, a drop in orders is a fair indication of current trends in the industry.
Consumer spending was described as restrained in December.
Sales in dollars were up approximately 10 percent on the average.
Much of this performance was accomplished through vigorous sales efforts by retailers to draw down excessive inventories.
Retailers appear to be entering 1975 with great emphasis on inventory control.

California milk producers are facing problems in trying to maintain existing price levels in the face of declining consumption.
In Idaho and eastern Washington, inventories of processed and frozen potatoes are rising because of falling orders.

Utah is one state where industrial expansion is continuing with high levels of copper production and increasing coal production.
Banks are continuing efforts to control lending with varying success.
A large Utah bank reports that a careful handling of loan demand has reduced its loan-deposit ratio from 80 percent at midyear to 72 percent, but a large California bank had much less success in achieving a planned reduction in lending because of a lack of alternative sources of finance for its customers.
Consumer credit is described by one banker as sluggish, and other banks are also concerned about signs of increasing consumer delinquencies, even though actual losses are low.
Considerable variation exists in the views of our directors about the prospects for 1975.
The president of one large California bank thinks that the financial environment in 1975 will be tougher than 1974, and this situation will apply to the other sectors as well.
In contrast, another director, president of a large manufacturing company, thinks that the present recession will not be protracted.
Similarly, views on inflation are divided, with several directors feeling that the elimination of shortages will reduce the rate of inflation to a 6 percent annual rate by the end of 1975.
On the other hand, the directors of our Los Angeles branch agreed that inflation is still the number one problem.
