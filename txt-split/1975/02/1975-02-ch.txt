Shortages of certain types of bearings and hydraulic and electrical components continue, and steel plates and structurals are still on allocation, but such reports are much less frequent.
Prices of some industrial supplies, including specialty steels and fuel have softened, especially in the brokered markets.
Overall price inflation apparently continues, however.
A large producer of farm equipment says the average prices it pays for supplies and components rose significantly in December and January, although at a slower pace.
