Retail First District retailers continued to make gains.
Two stores reported bumpy summer seasons but strong results for the end of August and the first weeks of September as back-to-school buying got underway.
The up-and-down summer results were attributed, in one case, to the disruption caused by a major renovation and, in another, to weaker-than-expected tourist purchases.
Tourist-related sales were especially disappointing in Maine where Canadian tourists appear to have been discouraged by the exchange rate.
Other contacts also mentioned disappointing tourist activity, on Cape Cod and in Connecticut.
Hard goods continued to outpace soft, particularly women's sportswear, which is coming down from several years of excellent growth.
Prices of hard goods are stable to falling, and one merchant commented that promotional discounting of all goods is so widespread that consumers can always get high value for their dollars.
Inventories, whether high or low, were reported to be causing no problems.
Consumers' credit use is trending up, but merchants do not consider this a source of concern.

The affected firms do not view the slowing as a precursor to any major weakening in the economy.
Some capital goods producers are experiencing strong and increasing orders.
Overseas markets are said to be picking up slightly, but subsidiary operations are faring better than exports.
Respondents' capital expenditures are considerably above those in 1983.
Preliminary capital budgets for 1985 are about the same as 1984, although one contact noted that it would not take much of a deterioration in orders to discourage capital expenditures.
The emphasis in capital spending continues to be on productivity improvements.
Respondents were unanimous in reporting only moderate increases in materials prices; wage pressures were also said to be moderate.
Respondents are increasing their own prices very little, if at all.
Manufacturing inventories have increased in proportion to sales; for the most part, the firms contacted are not uncomfortable with these increases, but one plans a major inventory reduction drive.

One respondent finds that business lending, particularly for commercial and industrial real estate, has been robust.
However, another contact observes aggressive competition for loans from out-of-state banks.
