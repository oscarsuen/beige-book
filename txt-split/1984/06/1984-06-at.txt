The region's sales outpaced comparable increases nationally as well.
New-car sales in the District were booming in May, although the rate of increase trailed the nation because of the above-average growth of regional sales in 1983.

High prices, delayed construction, and adverse publicity concerning its financing problems have particularly limited attendance by visitors who live within a three-hour drive to the Fair.
