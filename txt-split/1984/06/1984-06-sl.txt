Merchandise at discount stores, however, continued to show large gains and most soft goods were in demand.
Air-conditioners sold extremely well, reportedly because of higher incomes, memories of last year's hot season and the beginning of summer.
Repair shops and other small service companies generally reported good receipts.

Smaller cars sold better than larger models, and truck sales averaged about 8 percent above a year ago.

In addition, there were a few interruptions of construction by strikes which may have restrained sales.

There has been some new apartment building in the St. Louis area, financed by insurance companies.

Agriculture Because of rains, many farmers were late in getting crops planted, some had to replant washed out fields, a number of farmers shifted to soybeans from corn, and a few fields are still idle.
Although production will be hampered by the adverse weather, total output is still expected to greatly exceed last year's crop which was reduced sharply by the PIK program and the severe drought.
Since many farmers are reported to be in serious financial condition, especially those who were highly leveraged and suffered from the severe drought last summer and fall, this year's crops are critical to their survival.
