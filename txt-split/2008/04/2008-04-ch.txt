Nonresidential development and construction grew slowly in March, reflecting infrastructure projects such as roads, hospitals, and churches as well as restaurants, gas stations, and hotels.

Contacts reported that these price developments may result in a smaller decline in corn planting and a more modest increase in soybean acres this spring than had been anticipated.
For both corn and soybeans, substantially higher input costs, including premiums for crop insurance, have increased breakeven prices for the current growing season.
