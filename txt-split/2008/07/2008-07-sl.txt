Agriculture and Natural Resources The development of the District's major crops remains behind its 5-year averages.
In early July, at least 88 percent of the total corn, soybeans, cotton, sorghum, and rice were rated in fair or better condition, comparable to last year.
As a percentage of total acres planted, farmers in the District states plan to harvest 5 percentage points less corn for grain and 3 percentage points less soybeans than in 2007, partly because of recent flooding in Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri.
The winter wheat harvest is at least 93 percent complete in over half of the District states, but less than 70 percent complete in Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri.
Based on July estimates, total winter wheat production in the District states is expected to be about 77 percent larger than last year.
