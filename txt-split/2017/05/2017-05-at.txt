Many contractors and manufacturers from construction-related fields continued to report that their inability to find qualified workers was impeding growth.
Contacts from the energy industry mentioned that the lack of available skilled craft labor was a roadblock to petrochemical-related construction.

Most builders expect construction activity to hold steady at the current pace or increase slightly over the next three months.
Many District commercial real estate contacts reported improvements in demand that have resulted in rent growth and increased absorption, but the rate of improvement varied by metropolitan area, submarket, and property type.
The majority of commercial contractors indicated that the pace of nonresidential construction activity had risen from one year ago, with many reporting increasing backlogs.
While most reports indicated that the pace of multifamily construction matched or exceeded the year-ago level, a growing share of contacts reported that multifamily construction is down.

Lenders increased oversight of construction loans and were growing more cautious in multi-family lending.
Energy Reports from energy contacts indicated that rising shale production created new pipeline projects to transport oil and gas to refining centers on the Gulf Coast.
Contacts also indicated that oil and gas inventories remained elevated despite increased demand.
Utility industry contacts across the District reported that demand in industrial and residential usage increased slightly while commercial demand declined.
