An outlets operator reported modest, but slowing, sales growth in August and September, with strength in shoes and jeans as well as housewares and furniture.
Convenience store contacts indicated a slight pickup in traffic and spending in September, which they attributed more to favorable weather than to a shift in the sales trend.
Auto dealers throughout the region reported modest increases in year-over-year sales this period, an improvement from the modest declines during the prior period.
New Jersey dealers indicated that the pickup in sales was driven by incentives and wondered how manufacturers would alter incentives around a spike in demand following the recent hurricanes.
Although sales remained generally in line with the high levels seen in 2016, dealers continued to face difficulty sustaining profitability.

Strong gains were reported from the Poconos and shore locations in Delaware and New Jersey.
