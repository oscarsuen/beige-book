Summary of Economic Activity The Fifth District economy expanded at a slightly faster, albeit still modest, pace than during the previous Beige Book reporting period.

Port volumes remained very robust and increased modestly further despite some weather disruptions, while reports on other freight were mixed.
Retail sales rose at a modest pace while tourism activity was boosted by the early arrival of warm weather.
