Activity increased in construction, manufacturing, energy, and mining, while commercial real estate activity was flat at strong levels.
Tourism activity was mixed, while consumer spending and residential real estate were down, and agriculture remained weak.
Employment and Wages Employment grew moderately since the last report, checked by tight labor conditions.
From February to mid-March, initial unemployment claims were 14 percent lower relative to a comparable period a year earlier, dropping in every state except South Dakota.

Firms catering to tourists in the Black Hills region reported difficulty finding labor, especially seasonal immigrant labor they have traditionally used.
A Montana source said many firms are hiring, "but there's not enough workforce for all of the openings."
The oil-producing region of North Dakota saw an increase in hiring, according to a state contact.
Employer booths at recent job fairs there were sold out and had double the job openings of the previous year, including one company looking to hire 200 to 300 certified drivers.
There were some notable job losses, including 55 at a Minnesota construction firm and 100 at a South Dakota senior care organization, along with those affected by numerous retail closures across the District.
But overall, said one source, "the good news certainly seems to be outweighing the bad news right now."
A survey of employers in District states found that their second-quarter hiring outlook was solidly positive and more optimistic than a similar, first-quarter survey.

A staffing firm in Minneapolis-St. Paul reported that wages have increased by more than 3 percent from a year ago; reports from staffing firms in Montana and Wisconsin suggested even larger increases.

A national department store chain closed 20 stores across states in the Ninth District.
In Grand Forks, N.D., alone, three mall-based department stores closed, in one case, the closure was due to bankruptcy.

However, commercial construction permitting was lower in most District metros compared with the same period a year earlier.

Commercial real estate was flat, but remained solid by most measures.
Office vacancy rates in Minneapolis-St. Paul have ticked higher after significant new office development.
There were reports of more preleasing before new projects move into the construction phase.
A Minneapolis-St. Paul source noted that retail vacancies had crept up to 6 percent, but that "is still considered very low.
Prime retail areas are very tight and have high rents."
Despite significant new construction in recent years, office and industrial vacancy rates in Sioux Falls, S.D., remained low, while apartment vacancies have risen thanks to an influx of new units.
Residential real estate was lower overall.
Some Montana regions saw growth in home sales, but sales elsewhere in the District were lower, the result of low inventories, according to numerous sources, which were leading to quicker sales and higher prices.
In Rapid City, S.D., said one source, sellers "can expect to get full market value."

Information technology and software firms in Sioux Falls indicated continued growth in sales since the last report.
Accounting firms across the Ninth District reported a normal, seasonal uptick in activity given the tax season.
