Most general retailers reported a slight increase in year-over-year sales halfway through the first quarter.
Similarly, the majority of hospitality contacts in St. Louis, Memphis, and Little Rock indicated that sales during this period met expectations and that they anticipate sustained growth in the months to come.

In a recent survey, contacts reported an improvement in manufacturing conditions.

This is an improvement from our previous survey, when most contacts reported no change in activity from one year earlier.

Despite the optimistic outlook, some contacts expressed concerns about labor shortages and possible trade restrictions.

About two-thirds of service and transportation contacts reported sales met or exceeded expectations in the current quarter, and two-thirds of contacts expect dollar sales to be higher in the second quarter than at the same time last year.
Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate activity has improved slightly since our previous report.
Real estate contacts reported mixed home sales activity, indicating little change in overall sales.
Nearly half of respondents indicated that sales fell short of expectations midway through the first quarter, citing reasons such as low inventory levels and higher mortgage rates.
Still, many real estate contacts expect demand to improve in the second quarter, pushing single-family sales above one year ago.

The overall outlook among banking contacts is positive, with contacts citing expectations of modestly higher loan demand and the possibility of regulatory relief reducing compliance costs.
Agriculture and Natural Resources Agriculture conditions were unchanged from the previous report.
As of the end of January, more than 94 percent of District winter wheat was rated fair or better, a slight improvement over crop condition at the end of January 2016 and the current crop's condition at the end of December.
However, contacts reported that lower grain prices continued to affect farmers in the area, who have further reduced investment in land and equipment.
Natural resource extraction conditions improved slightly from the previous report, with coal production stabilizing and higher coal prices helping profits.
District seasonally-adjusted coal production was little changed from December to January, while production was 10 percent above last year's level.
