Energy Tenth District energy activity continued to grow modestly and expectations for future activity were positive.
The number of active oil and gas rigs moderated somewhat, particularly oil rigs in Oklahoma.
Still, oil and gas production was expected to increase since most drilling activity focused on development rather than exploration.
Activity picked up modestly in New Mexico's San Juan Basin and Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin.
Activity in Oklahoma's Arkoma basin, a predominately natural gas play, also expanded modestly since the last survey period.
Respondents continued to focus on operating within cash flows, but said private equity capital remained readily available.
Agriculture The District farm economy and credit conditions continued to weaken since the previous reporting period, but the pace of the declines slowed.
Farm income remained weak in November, which continued to reduce working capital and increase demand for financing.
Farm loan repayment rates also generally declined, but at a more moderate pace than in the previous reporting period.
District contacts reported that stronger livestock markets and expectations of a strong fall harvest kept loan repayment rates from declining more sharply.
Farmland values also moderated further in most areas, but remained steady in areas where crop production was particularly high.
District contacts noted that credit monitoring has increased slightly and interest rates on farm loans have edged higher alongside the elevated risk in the sector.
However, most contacts expected only minimal sales of farm assets to improve cash flow and working capital.
