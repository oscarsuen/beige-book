Nearly all contacts note that sales growth has not met expectations.
Unseasonably warm weather in October led to lackluster sales of several items, particularly winter clothing, shoes and outerwear.

A positive side effect of the general slowing in all construction is that material shortages are less frequent.
Backlogs of orders have also kept construction companies busy, with large projects continuing in many areas.
Banking and Finance Respondents to a recent Senior Loan Officers survey report that credit standards for almost all loan categories remain unchanged.
Some tightening of standards for commercial real estate loans has occurred, though.
Terms on some commercial and industrial (C&I) loans have been tightened moderately because of what banks view as a reduced tolerance for risk and signs of worsening industry-specifics.
Demand for all loan products is more varied.
Some respondents indicate stronger demand for C&I loans, while others note weaker demand for commercial and residential real estate loans.
Agriculture and Natural Resources Many areas across the District have experienced favorable weather conditions since mid-October, which enabled farmers to complete the harvest early.
Rainfall in mid-November across much of the District helped return topsoil moisture to adequate levels and should prove beneficial to both seeded and newly established winter wheat.
The winter wheat crop reportedly is in good-to-excellent condition in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Arkansas, average condition in Missouri, and poor-to-fair condition in Mississippi.
Surveys and reports indicate that this year's corn yields in all District states except Arkansas and Mississippi are well above last year's yields.
