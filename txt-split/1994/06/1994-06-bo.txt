Economic activity continues to pick up in the First District.
Among manufacturers, the recovery appears to have broadened considerably.
Retailers, by contrast, seem to fall into either a high- growth or a no-growth camp.
While prices charged by manufacturing and retail contacts are generally holding steady, some materials costs reportedly are increasing.
Retail First District retail sales results varied widely in recent months.
Two discount specialty chains reported increases in sales of roughly 20 percent in April and May compared to year-earlier levels.
By contrast, other retail contacts experienced a drop in sales for one or both months, which they attribute to unseasonably cool weather, rising interest rates, and a truckers' strike.
Even these retailers, however, have seen a sharp rise in shopping since the arrival of hot weather just before Memorial Day, especially for summer goods, such as garden supplies, patio furniture, and barbecue equipment.
Retail contacts' expectations also vary widely, with a range from 0 to 20 percent in anticipated sales growth over the next six months compared to a year earlier.
Most contacts report little or no change in their own or vendor prices, with the exception of increases for wood products.
Many retailers say they are struggling to maintain gross margins by cutting operating costs and reducing inventories.
Employment levels remain flat, but a few contacts plan major capital expansions this year or next.

Prices of cotton and flax fibers have risen noticeably since the beginning of the year.
Most contacts do not appear concerned about materials inflation, in part because some other costs are falling.
One-third of the respondents report success in negotiating reductions in purchased goods and services prices.
Half express intentions to continue to prune their work force or introduce other efficiencies.
