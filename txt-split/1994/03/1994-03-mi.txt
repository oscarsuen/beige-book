Retail sales were reportedly depressed on very cold days, but rebounded when the weather moderated.
Cold weather made some livestock care more difficult, but has not noticeably affected output.
A few ski areas reported slack business during cold periods, but snowmobiling was not reduced, and overall winter recreation activity is good.

Copper and gold output apparently remains steady from late 1993.
New gold mines continue in the planning or permitting process in South Dakota and Montana, but are not expected to be in production this year.
Iron ore officials continue to anticipate that production in the 1994 season will be the highest thus far in the 1990s, though there are concerns that unusually heavy ice coverage on the Great Lakes will delay opening of the shipping season by two weeks or more.
