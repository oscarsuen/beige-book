An increase in advertising boosted demand for newsprint, while sales of corrugated containers were reported to be the strongest in the nation.
Demand was higher for electrical and electronic machinery although prices remained unchanged or lower.
Electrical contacts still anticipate a deceleration in sales because they believe demand has been growing at an unsustainable rate.
Cold weather in the east increased demand for refined products.
The demand spurt reduced inventories and improved prices and margins, but contacts said overcapacity will keep the industry outlook weak.

Demand for warehouse space was strong and some speculative warehouses were under construction.
Other commercial markets were unchanged although contacts were more optimistic that activity would increase, in part because of NAFTA.
Contacts said that there was a surplus of sales people and development managers but a shortage of specialized tradesmen.
Frigid weather and snowstorms in the Northeast caused a light flurry of activity in the energy industry and boosted futures prices for oil and natural gas.
Oil prices quickly fell back to around $14 per barrel, but natural gas prices are not expected to fall until storage tanks are refilled in the spring and summer.
Oil exploration fell sharply in January but was partially offset by more than expected drilling for natural gas.
