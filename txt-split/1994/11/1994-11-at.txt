Construction September home sales have moved below last year's strong level, according to District realtors.
The fall-off in sales is attributed to rising mortgage rates which have squeezed some buyers out of the market and prompted others to wait and see.

Auto lending is mixed, with some banks reporting demand as flat, and others noting a modest uptick.

The number of reports of price pressures continues to mount.
