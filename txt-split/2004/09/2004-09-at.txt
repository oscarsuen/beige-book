Consumer Spending District contacts reported that July retail sales exceeded year-ago levels.

In Florida, pre-storm spending on emergency goods and repair purchases after the hurricane may turn out to be more significant than the direct loss of sales due to the storm.
However, significant out-of-pocket repair bills will act as a drag on consumer spending in the effected areas going forward.

Increased building activity associated with the hurricane will likely put additional strain on construction material and labor resources in Florida.
Activity in District commercial real estate markets remained at low levels, while modest improvements in leasing activity were noted.

However, employment in the apparel industry continued to slide, and contacts in some other industries reported that they remained cautious about expansion and hiring.

Some truckers in Georgia and Florida were also busy addressing demands from disaster relief agencies.
Domestic and international air transportation services reported strong demand in Atlanta and Miami.

Demand continued to be particularly strong for healthcare workers.
Manufacturers added jobs in the auto and defense-related industries, but apparel firms continued to shed employees.
By some accounts, Hurricane Charley's net impact on employment over coming months will likely be modestly positive.
Increased hiring in disaster relief services and in construction should more than offset direct temporary layoffs in tourism and retail sectors.

For instance, manufacturers of plastics reported that petroleum-based input prices have "skyrocketed" in recent months.
Storm-related construction in Florida is likely to put further upward pressure on lumber, cement, and labor costs.

The USDA estimated that the storm ruined around 20 percent of this year's citrus harvest, including about 10 percent of the orange crop.
Futures prices for orange juice increased from recent lows, although high inventories reportedly moderated the size of the increase.
