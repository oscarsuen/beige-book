Manufacturing and Other Business Activity The Eighth District's manufacturing sector continues to show signs of strong improvements in many areas.
Reports of plant openings, hiring, and relocations to the District have increased since our last report.
Manufacturers in the metal products, transportation equipment, automotive parts, prefabricated buildings and home elements, food processing, packaging, recreational equipment and parts, and industrial equipment sectors reported stronger orders, plant expansions, and plant openings in part due to new product line introductions and increases in consumer demand.
Despite strong growth in some areas, other District manufacturers reported layoffs and plant closings.
Manufacturers in the paper materials, textile, tobacco, electrical equipment, energy, rubber, and printing sectors reported plant closings and layoffs due in part to company reorganization, the need to reduce costs, and foreign competition.
The District's services sector also shows signs of strong improvement in most areas.
In particular, firms in the health care, tourism and entertainment, freight transport, financial and insurance services, farm equipment, home hardware, and clothing retail sectors reported openings and expansions.
Despite the generally strong reports in the services sector, firms in the business solutions and food retail sectors reported closings and layoffs.

Banking and Finance A recent survey of senior loan officers at a sample of District banks indicated little change in overall lending activity in the past three months.
During this period, credit standards and demand for commercial and industrial loans remained unchanged for both large and small firms.
Meanwhile, both the credit standards and the demand for residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, credit cards, and other consumer loans were generally unchanged.
Agriculture and Natural Resources Recent heavy rains, and subsequent damage from flooding and pond formation, throughout the District have necessitated the replanting of some corn and soybean fields.
The rains, however, have helped improve soil moisture levels.
Despite weather damage in certain areas, the majority of the winter wheat crop is in good or excellent condition and will be ready for harvest within a few weeks in some places.
Nearly all of the intended corn, cotton, and rice crops have been planted.
Except in Kentucky, where planting is only slightly behind its normal pace, farmers in every District state have planted at least half of their soybean fields and more than two-thirds of the sorghum crop.
A majority of the District's other crops are in good or excellent condition, as are pastures and livestock.
