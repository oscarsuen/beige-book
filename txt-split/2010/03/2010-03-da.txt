Agriculture Heavy rains and snowfall have boosted crop and pasture conditions.
There is excellent subsoil moisture going into the spring planting season, which has improved the crop outlook for 2010.

Livestock are in fair to good condition, and producers are using supplemental feeding to compensate for the harsh winter weather and wet pasture conditions.
