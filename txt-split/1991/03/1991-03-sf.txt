The District's media industry is facing difficulties as a result of weakening economic conditions and the war.
Newspaper advertising, particularly national accounts, continues to fall off significantly at the same time that costs are rising as a result of expanded Gulf War coverage.
Television advertising also has dropped off, as advertisements were canceled at the start of the war, and expanded network coverage cut into available advertising spots.
Manufacturing Manufacturing activity in the West is reported to be mixed.
Defense- related manufacturing remains weak overall, although some companies report a pick-up in activity related to the Gulf War.
War-related orders range from engines for missiles to processed food products.
Several District manufacturers report increasing interest from overseas buyers, including Eastern Europe, Latin and South America, and the Middle East.
Business investment plans for many manufacturing firms in the District remain cautious.
Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries Difficult conditions continue for the District's agriculture and forest products industries.
The fifth year of drought in California will result in reduced production of field crops and increased production costs.
Higher feed prices and lack of adequate grazing land will force cattle into feedlots early, lowering livestock prices.
California farmers with access to Colorado River or Sacramento Delta water, or who have their own wells will likely come through the drought in good shape.
For many others, reduced production may be partially offset by rising prices for their products.
The District's wood products industry continues to weaken in response to slow economic activity.
Western lumber production is reported down 24 percent in the first five weeks of 1991 from the same period a year ago.
Orders and shipments of pulp and paper products also are reported off significantly from last year.

Many reports suggest that weak economic conditions combined with closer regulatory scrutiny have caused this tightening of credit standards.
