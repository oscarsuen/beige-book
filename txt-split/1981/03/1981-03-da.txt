Respondents in the manufacturing sector report no changes in output and employment levels.
Nominal sales at District department stores have risen slightly since the time of the last Redbook survey and are up 12 percent from year-ago levels.
Continued increases are expected in coming months.
Respondents attribute the increase in sales to unseasonally warm weather and a relatively low level of consumer debt.
Use of retail stores' credit cards is rising moderately.
Apparel and other soft goods account for most of the growth in sales.
Purchases of furniture and appliances are depressed, and these items are being promoted heavily.
