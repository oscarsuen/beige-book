Home sales increased across most locations and markets, most notably in urban areas and in the market for existing homes.
Sales were particularly strong for homes under $250,000.
Residential rents and home prices rose moderately, though one contact reported that an increase in supply held prices flat for homes over $500,000.
Demand for nonresidential construction was little changed overall, but one contact did note an increase in industrial construction.
Commercial real estate activity rose modestly, with contacts reporting gains in both the for-sale and for-lease markets, particularly in urban areas.

Activity remained strong in autos and aerospace, but was weaker in most other industries.
Growth in steel demand picked up as service centers began investing in inventories again after a year and a half of trying to pare back stocks.
Specialty metals manufacturers reported little change in new orders on balance, with increases in demand from autos and aerospace but declines in orders from the oil and gas industry.
Heavy machinery manufacturers reported weak growth overall, with poor results in the rental and petroleum segments offsetting stronger demand from construction.
A heavy trucks manufacturer reported declining orders.

Growth in non-wage labor costs was steady.
Agriculture Contacts expect the growing season to get off to a decent start in most of the District, even though wet, cool weather meant that both the planting and emergence of corn and soybeans were behind the pace of last spring.
Corn and soybean prices rose during the reporting period, but soybean prices rose more, which may cause farmers to plant more soybeans at the expense of corn.
At current prices, contacts believe that farms can cover this year's costs for soybean production but not for corn.
Many farmers took advantage of the price rally and boosted their working capital by selling old crops and locking in prices on new crops.
Milk and dairy product prices moved lower, as production remained strong.
Cattle prices were down as well.
Hog prices increased however, helped by solid demand from China, and there was one report of new construction of hog facilities.
