Manufacturing Growth in manufacturing production picked up to a moderate pace in July and early August.
Activity continued to be strong in autos and aerospace, and increased in most other industries.
Growth in steel demand was steady, and declining imports (reflecting in part recently imposed duties on steel imports for some countries) helped domestic producers gain market share.

Agriculture Already low expectations for farm incomes deteriorated over the reporting period as the potential for a record national harvest pushed prices down further.

Corn and soybean prices moved lower, although soybean prices remained above last year's level.
Strong supplies also resulted in declines for wheat, egg, dairy, hog, and cattle prices.
The USDA announced limited purchases of dairy and egg products to help address excess supplies.
