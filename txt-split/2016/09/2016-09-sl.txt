Several companies reported capital expenditure and facility expansion plans in the District, particularly among firms that manufacture transportation equipment and industrial machinery.
However, reports from manufacturers of primary and fabricated metal products were generally weak.

Reports of plans in the District's service sector have been positive since the previous report.
In particular, several firms that provide business support services, information technology services, and education services announced plans to build new facilities and hire new employees.
Despite growth in the sector, nearly half of service sector contacts reported that sales in the current quarter fell short of expectations.
However, the majority reported an increase in the dollar value of sales relative to one year ago, and most expect an improvement in sales in the fourth quarter relative to the fourth quarter one year ago.
Reports from the transportation sector were generally mixed; notably, a contact in the railroad industry reported that sales continued to trend downward as a result of fewer coal and crude oil shipments.
Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate activity has weakened slightly since the previous report but has remained strong overall.
Compared with a year ago, July home sales decreased across all four major MSAs, declining by 9 percent in St. Louis, 5 percent in Louisville, 4 percent in Memphis and less than 1 percent in Little Rock.
Despite this slowdown, year-to-date sales are higher than one year ago and most real estate contacts reported that recent sales have met expectations.
Some contacts noted that some of the sales shortfall was due to a lack of inventory, and approximately two-thirds of contacts indicated that inventory was slightly lower than a year ago.
Residential construction activity continued to improve.

Credit standards were unchanged in all loan categories.
Creditworthiness of applicants was slightly lower for commercial and industrial loans and largely unchanged for all other loan categories.
Delinquencies fell or remained stable across the District for all loan categories.
Agriculture and Natural Resources While the quick return to low crop prices has weakened the near-term outlook for farm income, crop conditions bode well for strong yields.
The proportions of corn, cotton, rice, and soybeans rated fair or better were roughly the same as in our previous report, but the proportion of crops rated excellent increased.
Contacts also reported good conditions.
Multiple contacts noted that expected strong yields, both in the District and elsewhere, are likely playing a role in the return of low prices.
The sharp downward trend continues for coal production, with July production down 18 percent from a year ago, and year-to-date production down 27 percent.
