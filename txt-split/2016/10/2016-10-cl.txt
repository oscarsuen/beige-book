Manufacturing Manufacturing output was little changed over the period.
Activity for suppliers to the motor vehicle, aerospace, commercial construction, housing, and personal consumer products industries remains elevated.
Factors tempering output growth for other manufacturing industries include lower business fixed investment, the strong dollar, and weakness in the energy sector.
Year-to-date production through August at District auto assembly plants fell about 6 percent when compared to that of the same time period during 2015.
Declines were weighted more heavily toward cars.
One original equipment manufacturer reported that the lack of light truck inventory, not the decline in demand, is the reason behind a year-over-year unit volume drop.

Manufacturers expect that business conditions will show a modest improvement in the upcoming months.
Contacts anticipating weaker growth attribute the situation to uncertainty and weakness in global markets.
Cutbacks in capital spending that began mid-year have accelerated.
Although firms continue to allocate monies for maintenance projects and product development, they are lowering spending for equipment.

New-home contracts were distributed across price-point categories.
Entry-level contracts ticked higher.
New-home list prices moved higher over the period to cover higher costs for labor and land development and higher prices for building materials.

Reports indicated that the number of inquiries and backlogs have increased over the period, after both metrics weakened early in the third quarter.

Subcontractors remain very busy.
They are challenged by labor shortages and, as a result, many are selective when bidding.
In order to cover rising labor costs, most subcontractors are increasing their rates.
Consumer Spending Heading into the Labor Day weekend, retailers reported little change in revenues on net compared to those of the same time period a year ago.
Although the retail landscape remains very competitive, recent initiatives aimed at adapting to rapidly changing consumer buying habits are helping boost revenues for some chains.
The unseasonably warm weather has impacted cold-weather apparel sales.

For the period between Labor Day and mid-November, our contacts expect little change in revenues compared to the same time period a year ago.
Overall, vendor prices were stable.
Select retail chains reported that they are continuing with initiatives to incrementally reduce shelf prices.
In contrast, some restaurateurs are raising menu prices.
Retail payrolls were stable.
The labor market for hourly front line and distribution workers is tight, a situation which is driving up wages.
Year-to-date sales through August of new motor vehicles declined 1.5 percent when compared to those of the same time period in 2015.
Light trucks (including SUVs and crossovers) continue to dominate transactions, and leasing accounts for more than 40 percent of all new-motor-vehicle transactions within the District.
One dealer noted that banks are starting to tighten credit terms on subprime opportunities because delinquencies are beginning to rise with these customers.

Energy The number of permits issued and the number of drilling rigs operating in the Marcellus and Utica Shales are showing signs of trending higher as wellhead prices rise at a slow pace.
Coal production has increased during the past couple of months because of rising demand for electricity attributable to above normal temperatures and reduced customer inventory at coal-fired power plants.
As a result, spot and forward prices for domestic thermal coal have increased.
Prices for metallurgical coal have also risen, a situation which has been driven largely by production cuts and increased demand.
Energy payrolls increased slightly, though much of the increase was seasonal.
Wages were steady.
Freight Transportation Freight volume contracted on a year-over-year basis and remains at a low level.
Our contacts attributed this situation to sluggish growth, especially in the industrial sector, and rapid changes in retail distribution.
One contact noted that shipment counts industry wide were flat for the first eight months of 2016 except for select carriers who contract with large on line retailers.
In the latter case, volume is rising.
We heard several reports about overcapacity in the system, and this overcapacity is forcing some haulers to lower shipping rates and to reduce capital budgets.
Spending is now primarily for maintenance projects and equipment replacement.
On balance, our contacts expect little change in volume during the upcoming months.
In general, freight payrolls have declined over the period.
Hiring is limited to replacement.
