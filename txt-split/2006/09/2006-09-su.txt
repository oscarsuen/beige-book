Agriculture and Natural Resources Drought and near-drought conditions persisted throughout much of the country, depressing crop production and livestock sustainability.

Dallas reported that more than 50 percent of key crops were in poor shape, and the consequent acceleration of the liquidation of cattle is expected to cut beef supplies significantly over the next few years.
Weather conditions improved somewhat in the Kansas City District; nonetheless, the region's crops continued to suffer from prior drought conditions, and cattle producers there also plan faster liquidation of herds.
St. Louis reported mixed conditions.
The bright spots were in the Chicago District, where above-average rains reduced stress and improved the crop outlook from earlier drought conditions, and in the San Francisco District, where conditions were reported as favorable.
The demand for oil and natural gas was reported as continuing to be robust, and facilities were operating near capacity.
