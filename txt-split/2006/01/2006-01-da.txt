Dry weather is straining agricultural conditions, but the 2005 cotton crop was one of the largest ever.
Prices Contacts in many industries expressed concerns about high or rising costs.
Increased costs led to higher selling prices at some firms, but many said that stiff competition was limiting their ability to increase prices.
Input costs are up for a number of products, including energy, fuel, health insurance, shipping, lumber, paper, metals and property insurance.

Energy prices remain high by historical standards.
Cold weather in the northern United States led to gains in heating oil and natural gas prices in December.
Reduced consumption and warmer weather pushed natural gas prices down sharply in January.
Natural gas and crude oil inventories are high.
After falling steadily through mid-December, retail gasoline prices were pushed up at the end of December by rising crude prices and fears that MTBE regulation could reduce supply.

Workers with specialized skills remain in short supply, such as to supply the energy industry, trucking and some areas of manufacturing and information technology.
Temporary service firms say a very high percentage of workers are obtaining full time positions from initial short term contracts.
Manufacturing Manufacturing activity strengthened.

Petrochemical demand and prices weakened from very strong levels.
Downstream processors did not want to build inventory because they sense price reductions ahead, while producers held back on building inventories for year-end tax purposes.

There have also been fewer shipments of wood and metallic ores.
The industry is working near capacity, and there are plans to add rail lines and purchase locomotives this year.
Airlines report that demand has increased and is growing faster than capacity domestically.
This has allowed carriers to increase prices and profits.

Twenty six percent of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico was off line on December 22, down from 46 percent on November 15.
