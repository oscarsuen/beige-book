Retail hiring was limited to staffing new stores.

Orders of agricultural equipment were flat.
Activity in the tooling industry remained brisk, led by demand from the energy sector.
Steel producers reported strong demand from all markets and growing backlogs.
Steel imports were increasing as well.

Nationwide, light vehicle sales were flat between March and early April.
One automaker said that vehicle inventories were "excessive," and that this would lead to either production cuts or higher incentives.

Still, contacts said that more and timely rains will be critical for the growing season.
Contacts continued to believe that soybean acres would increase relative to corn this year.
However, the gains likely will be not as big as previously reported due to recent changes in the relative crop prices and fertilizer costs.
