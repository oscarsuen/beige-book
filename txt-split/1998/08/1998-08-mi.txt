But ill winds, especially from Asia, are increasingly retarding the pace of growth.
General retailing, autos, tourism and construction are strong.
Real estate markets are very active in both residential and commercial categories.
Unemployment rates remain very low, and labor markets show continuing symptoms of tightness.
Manufacturing output, while still high overall, is beginning to slacken, especially in those products or firms with substantial Asian exposure.
Manufacturing exports are down on a year-over-year basis.
The natural resource sectors, particularly agriculture, mining and energy development, face low prices, and drilling and mining activity is faltering.
Reports of upward pressure on overall compensation are widespread, despite data showing only moderate increases in direct, cash compensation.
Real Estate and Construction "Sizzling home market continues," headlines a Minneapolis article reporting double-digit increases in sales of existing homes for the first half of 1998 compared to a year ago.
Realtors also report strong activity in office, commercial and light industrial space.
Construction is similarly booming.
Residential building permits for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area were up 38 percent in June and 22 percent for the year, again compared to the same periods in 1997.
In growing regional centers such as Rochester, Minn., Sioux Falls, S.D., Eau Claire Wis., and in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, strong residential building is matched by robust commercial work.
The downtown areas of both Minneapolis and St. Paul show the fastest pace of large office building projects in a decade.

Agriculture Farming is the most troubled sector of the district economy.
In terms of output, prospects are good in most areas.
Crop conditions are generally favorable, and late spring rains in Montana alleviated earlier worries about drought.
Output of wheat, corn and soybeans should be at or above five-year averages for states as a whole.
Specific regions face less favorable conditions.
Areas of Minnesota and North Dakota which had severe plant disease problems over several years expect similar damage this year to wheat and barley.
Dry conditions in grazing areas this spring reduced hay yields and will force some ranchers to buy hay sooner or later.
Prices rather than crop conditions are the main concern.
Wheat growers are under the greatest pressure in terms of output price relative to costs, but corn and soybean prices have also fallen to a point where many producers will find it difficult to pay all costs.

Prices for consumer goods as well as commodities and intermediate goods show little increase.
Low gasoline prices and low prices for crop and livestock products are undoubtedly helping to hold down the general price level, but manufacturers and retailers continue to report difficulty in making any price increase stick in a competitive environment.
