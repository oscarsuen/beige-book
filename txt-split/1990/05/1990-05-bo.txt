While a majority of contacts indicate that shipments exceeded year-ago levels, several respondents face declining backlogs.
Only one-quarter of the firms report new orders above year-ago levels.
Market conditions vary considerably by industry and product line.
In general, consumer luxuries, office supplies, and products related to autos, construction and defense remain relatively weak; however, a few contacts noted a recent pick-up in major appliances, and in automotive and paper products.
While soft, defense generally held up better than contacts expected.
Commercial aircraft, power systems, and computer-related supplies face relatively strong demand, and exports continue to provide welcome support.

They expect very slow growth throughout the nation, not just within the region, and a few have downgraded their outlook on the basis of first quarter sales.
Although most contacts believe that their firms are on solid ground, few expect to make much headway during 1990. Credit Availability Contacts in small businesses and in organizations serving them claim that financial difficulties at some of the region's banks have made it more difficult and costly than previously for small business to obtain credit.
According to these contacts, banks are requiring small firms to increase their collateral and provide personal guarantees; some current loans are being called.
Most large and medium-sized manufacturers, in contrast, are experiencing no difficulties obtaining credit.
Residential Real Estate First District realtors report that March-April sales were slightly below year-ago levels.

Expectations are mixed.
