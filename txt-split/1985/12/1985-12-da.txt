With the exception of lumber and wood products, respondents find that declines in the value of the dollar have not yet resulted in increased orders.
Despite some recent improvement in sales, lumber and wood producers expect the usual seasonal declines in demand to result in temporary plant shutdowns.
Primary and fabricated metals manufacturers report reductions in orders, which they attribute to slowing current activity in commercial construction.
These same manufacturing industries, together with producers of nonelectrical machinery, also face declining demand from the troubled oil and gas drilling industry.

Output is rising in the food processing and chemical industries, while petroleum refinery activity is slipping and apparel industry demand remains weak.
Drilling activity in the Eleventh District continues to decline at accelerating rates.
The number of active drilling rigs in Texas is falling at slightly faster rates than in the U.S.
Leading indicators of drilling, including the seismic crew count and the number of well permit applications, are also slipping.
Retail sales respondents report weak growth and say they expect a poor fourth quarter, overall.
They also note that fashion lines are selling well while demand for big ticket items, such as home furniture and electronics, is low.
Retailers say they are managing their inventories more closely than last year.
The seasonal reduction in auto sales was much smaller in October of this year than is normal for the period.
Dealers attribute this strong performance to interest rate promotions offered by domestic manufacturers.

The value of residential construction contracts fell in August and September, after strong growth earlier this year.
The number of housing permits issued in the District fell in September, reversing the upturn in permit issuance that began early in the year.
Much of the downturn is due to renewed declines in multifamily building.

In October, both total loans and securities at the District's large banks declined absolutely from a year earlier.
The rate of growth in loans and securities also declined in both August and September; although it remained positive in those months.
The pace of decline in October for loans was substantially larger than for securities, and was concentrated in consumer loans, business loans, and other loans.

The impetus for higher prices comes from reduced supplies, however, so that total revenue may not increase.
