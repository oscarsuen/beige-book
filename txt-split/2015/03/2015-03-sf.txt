Retail Trade and Services Overall retail sales activity grew moderately during the reporting period.
Automobile sales were strong, and demand for SUVs was robust.
Some contacts reported new data on holiday sales since the last reporting period.
Merchants in some areas showed very strong holiday sales and would have seen even larger volumes if not for delays receiving merchandise caused by labor disputes at West Coast ports.
In other regions, holiday sales were not quite as strong as expected, and, as a result, retailers in those areas still have a little excess inventory.
Contacts reported that most retailers are optimistic about growth over the coming year, citing decreases in gas prices and improvements in employment conditions.
However, the outlook is weaker in areas where unemployment remains relatively high.
Demand for business and consumer services grew moderately during the reporting period.

U.S. Department of Defense budget challenges have reduced new orders and diminished capacity utilization in the defense aerospace sector.
Reduced demand for equipment used in mining and the energy sector contributed to softening orders for recycled steel and metals.
However, demand for these products from the auto industry and the commercial construction sector remained robust.
Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries Agricultural conditions in the District were mixed during the reporting period.
Drought conditions and unseasonably warm weather in parts of the District contributed to lower yields, but the associated increases in many of the prices received by farmers resulted in slightly higher revenues.
Farmers remain concerned that the drought will continue, requiring them to leave more acreage fallow.
Numerous contacts reported that the labor disputes at West Coast ports reduced agricultural exports, as perishable products such as fruits wasted away in storage containers waiting for shipment.

One contact commented that single-family home construction in their area has been limited to only pre-sold homes.
In some relatively fast-growing areas, shortages of skilled labor are contributing to the tepid pace of construction.
Several contacts reported a pick-up in the pace of single-family home sales but little change in prices.

Deposit growth was strong in many areas, and banks have ample liquidity.
Stiff competition for high-quality borrowers exerted downward pressure on loan interest rates.
