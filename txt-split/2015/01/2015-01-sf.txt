Retail Trade and Services Overall retail sales activity grew moderately during the reporting period.
Holiday spending tended to be higher than in recent years and notably so in some areas.
Sales met most expectations, with few reports of excess inventories.
Higher-priced items, electronics, men's and women's clothing, cosmetics, and accessories sold well.
Online sales growth exceeded in-store growth.
Auto sales were robust in some areas, but came in somewhat below expectations in other regions.

Demand for cloud computing services continued to increase.
Sales in the limited service segment of the restaurant sector slowed a bit in November but ticked back up as the holiday season progressed.

Travel and tourism to Southern California grew substantially in 2014, and contacts expect this trend to continue into 2015.
In particular, travel from China grew rapidly in 2014, and new extended visa rules for Chinese visitors should encourage even more tourism.

Sequestration continued to erode revenues and capacity utilization in the defense aerospace sector, as the rate of new program starts declined.
Increases in the pace of commercial construction boosted domestic demand for recycled steel and metals.
However, the stronger dollar and weaker foreign demand reduced exports of these materials.
Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries Agricultural conditions in the District were mixed during the reporting period.
Declines in petroleum prices contributed to reductions in the cost of gas and fertilizer.
However, some farmers also faced lower prices for their commodities.
In some areas, restaurants purchased fewer vegetables.
Dairy farm profits increased significantly over the past year, but milk futures prices declined recently.
Uncertainty regarding future water availability in California slowed new plantings of permanent crops.

However, modest increases in the pace of new home construction in some areas slightly elevated domestic demand for logs.
Real Estate and Construction Real estate activity advanced during the reporting period.
The pace of new single-family home construction increased modestly in some areas of the District, with relatively more activity in urban areas than in rural areas.
However, some contacts cited increasing costs of materials and labor and a shortage of available lots in some areas in their projections that the pace of new construction will fall back in 2015.
Indeed, these contacts reported that the pace of construction permit issuance has declined.
A few contacts indicated that home sales picked up a bit in December, but some contacts reported that insufficient inventory is damping the pace of sales.
Multifamily residential real estate construction activity was strong in many areas of the District during the reporting period.

However, one contact reported that some investors are concerned that, given planned construction, there soon will be an excess supply of multifamily units in their area.

Some contacts reported a significant increase in loan demand, mostly in the construction segment.
Other contacts reported that overall loan demand remained somewhat weak.
In some areas, businesses with sufficient cash turned towards internal financing.
Deposit growth was strong in many areas, and banks have ample liquidity.
Stiff competition for high-quality borrowers exerted downward pressure on loan interest rates, and declines in net interest margins were widespread.
Some contacts reported that compressed margins contributed to increased acquisitions as smaller banks combined in order to reduce operating costs.
