Agriculture Significant rainfall across much of the district greatly improved soil moisture and pasture conditions and helped replenish ponds and lakes.
However, wet field conditions prevented some producers in South Texas from planting crops by the insurance deadline, and the heavy storms in North Texas damaged some of the wheat crop.
