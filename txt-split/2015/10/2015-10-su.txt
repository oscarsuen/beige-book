Manufacturing turned in a mixed but generally weaker performance during the latest reporting period, with a number of Districts noting adverse effects from the energy sector.
Some strength was reported in the motor vehicles, aerospace, and transportation equipment industries, while metals industries were generally weaker, in part, due to the strong dollar.

Both residential rental markets and commercial real estate markets were mostly stronger.
Commercial and residential multi-family construction showed further strength; single-family construction activity was more mixed but did increase modestly.
Reports on the banking and finance sector were generally positive, lending activity increased, loan quality was steady to improved, and lending standards were little changed or somewhat easier.
Agricultural conditions were mixed.
Growing conditions and farm output were solid in some Districts, but there were adverse effects from droughts in the south, as well as excessive rainfall in the Richmond and St. Louis Districts.

Wage growth remained subdued in most Districts since the previous report.
The Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts noted only slight to modest wage increases.

However, New York noted increased wage pressure for both skilled and less skilled workers, and San Francisco noted that the impact of higher minimum wages implemented over the past year began to filter through to the retail sector and resulted in increased wages for some lower-skilled workers.
Price pressures were said to be contained, as most Districts reported that both input and finished goods prices were little changed or up only slightly since the previous report.
Contacts in the Kansas City District noted that prices grew more slowly than in recent months, and eased in some sectors.
Moreover, low or declining prices for energy products, technology goods, some agricultural commodities, and metals were cited by some Districts.
