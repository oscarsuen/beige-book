Key factors tempering output include a strong dollar, the downturn in the energy sector, and weakening demand for agricultural equipment.

On balance, our contacts are cautiously optimistic in their outlook for the remainder of 2015.
The steel industry continued to experience stiff competition from imports, competition driven in part by the strong dollar.
As a result, steel shipments fell more than expected over the period.
Year-to-date auto production at District assembly plants through June fell 2 percent below the prior year's level.
This decline is primarily due to retooling at a medium-duty truck assembly plant.

Some manufacturers increased capital budgets to purchase equipment that could replace labor.
Steel makers and suppliers to the oil and gas industry cut budgets to control costs and preserve cash.

Backlogs were described as strong or strengthening, with work booked one to two years out.

Regarding multifamily, there is growing demand for affordable housing as increased rents have priced out low- and moderate-income individuals from select multifamily units.
There is concern about the sustainability of the current pace of growth in the construction industry during the next three years.
Some builders believe the current cycle could peak by 2017.
Capital spending by general contractors was mainly for new equipment and technology.

These situations are in addition to large minimum wage jumps in select metro areas.
Year-to-date sales of new motor vehicles through July were about 1 percent higher compared to those of a year ago.
A strong consumer preference for SUVs and light trucks continued.
One auto group owner remarked that while overall pricing is stable, consumers seem willing to invest in higher-priced trim levels and options, especially in SUVs.
New inventory is close to matching demand, except for the most popular models, where inventory is light.
Looking forward, dealers expect unit volumes will be on par with that of 2014.
Year-to-date pre-owned vehicle sales are moderately higher compared to those of last year.

Wellhead prices for oil dipped over the period, while natural gas prices have stabilized at a low level.
We heard several reports about capital budgets being adjusted downward as companies trim back their exploration and production plans.
In contrast, already contracted midstream infrastructure projects are moving forward.
Because of weak exploration activity, hiring within the oil and gas industry is modest and tightly controlled.
Industry wage pressures have dissipated with the decline in natural gas prices.

Declines were prevalent in consumer goods, steel, and energy-related shipments.
Growth was seen in intermodal transportation, electronics, and chemicals.
