Lower gas prices continued to promote the shift from cars to light trucks and SUVs.
Contacts also noted continued strength in demand for recreational vehicles.
Business Spending Growth in business spending picked up to a moderate pace.
Most manufacturers and retailers continued to report comfortable inventory levels.
Exceptions included steel service center inventories, which one contact noted were "bursting at the seams" after a surge in imports at the end of last year, and some auto dealers, who reported lean light truck inventories because of greater-than-expected demand.
The pace of current capital spending picked up somewhat and plans for the next six to twelve months continued to indicate steady growth in these expenditures.
Outlays were again primarily for replacing industrial and IT equipment, though many contacts also reported spending for capacity expansion.
Employment grew at a moderate pace and contacts expect this pace to continue through the rest of the year.

Demand for residential construction grew slightly, with contacts reporting some new development in suburban areas.
Sales of single-family homes also picked up, and contacts expected that buyer demand would continue to improve throughout the year.
Home prices increased, residential rents held steady, and housing inventories remained near historic lows, particularly for the bottom end of the market.
Contacts noted continued improvement in markets in low-income communities as real estate valuations and retail activity both increased.

The auto industry remained a source of strength for the District, with contacts again citing improvements in the labor market and low gasoline prices as bolstering demand.
Growth in the aerospace industry was also strong.
Capacity utilization in the steel industry decreased, as elevated service center inventories weighed on steel production.
Most specialty metals manufacturers reported gains in new orders and solid order books, with the exception of those supplying the oil and gas industry.

Energy prices were up slightly, but remained low.
Steel and other primary metals prices declined, but contacts did not expect much further change in prices one way or the other in the near term.

Wage pressures continued to be more pronounced for skilled workers than for unskilled workers, although there were more reports of wage increases for unskilled workers than in the previous reporting period.
Agriculture High stocks of corn and soybeans and slower export growth put downward pressure on most crop prices.
Stockpiles of crops from last year's good harvest started moving for sale amid concern about low future prices.
Wet fields in some areas and a cold winter have prevented most fieldwork from beginning.
Still, generally favorable conditions should allow rapid planting once temperatures rise.
Although higher input costs were encouraging farmers to shift some acreage from corn to soybeans, corn still looks profitable in some parts of the District, and many farmers continued to prefer their normal crop rotations.
Higher output of milk has put downward pressure on prices, leading many farmers to lock them in anticipation of possible further declines.
Hog prices fell because so many were brought to market, while cattle prices were up as herds are being rebuilt.
