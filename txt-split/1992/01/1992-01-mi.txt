The only part of the District in which the unemployment rate fell in November was South Dakota, which at 2.8 percent was down only 0.1 percent from the previous month and 0.4 percent from a year ago.

In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, housing sales were up 13 percent in the fourth quarter, and 3.8 percent year-to-date.
