Consumer Spending District retail sales strengthened significantly in May, following disappointing results in March and April.
Although May's sales gains varied from +2 to +11 percent on a year-over-year basis, most results were clustered at the upper end of the range.

Construction and Real Estate Midtown Manhattan's commercial real estate market weakened dramatically during April.
Leasing activity, which peaked in October and remained above 1.3 million square feet a month between November and March, declined to just 815,000 square feet.
Lower levels of leasing activity coupled with return of space to the market caused the supply of commercial space available in Midtown to rise.
Other Business Activity In contrast to the sharp decline in U.S. household employment, employment in both New York State and New Jersey rose during May.
New York's employment increase was attributable to a decline in the number of unemployed; as a result, New York's unemployment rate fell 0.5 percentage points in May to 8.3 percent.
New Jersey's rise in employment was accompanied by a slightly more rapid increase in the labor force, causing the unemployment rate to edge up to 6.5 percent.

Finally, several of the executives reported difficulty in attracting and retaining skilled labor.

The residential mortgage and the commercial and industrial loan segments have the highest levels of loan generation, with about one-third of the banks reporting higher demand, and nearly half reporting stable demand in each of these categories.
Though refinancing activity is steady or lower at almost all of the banks, some of the senior loan officers surveyed expect an increase in the near future.
Average loan rates have decreased at about sixty percent of the participating banks, and are the same at close to forty percent.
