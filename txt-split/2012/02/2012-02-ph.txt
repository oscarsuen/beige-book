Manufacturing Since the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have reported further increases in new orders and shipments.
Gains were widespread among the makers of food products, lumber and wood products, primary metals, instruments, and electronic equipment.
A supplier to the broad industrial market stated that demand accelerated over the past several months and that the production capacity of many manufacturing clients was picking up.
Contacts also reported that work was returning from overseas and that foundries were reaching capacity.
The primary metals sector reported strong demand from the automotive and heavy equipment sectors.
Among the makers of instruments and of electrical machinery, some contacts indicated that the level of demand seen recently has been the highest since near the beginning of the recession.
Even the housing sector contributed to slight upticks in demand, according to contacts from two firms that produce housing-related products.
About nine out of 10 Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve or stay the same during the next six months; most expect their business to increase.
This optimism permeates nearly every broad manufacturing sector.

Overall, retail contacts were a bit more optimistic but remain cautious.
Auto sales strengthened further in January and February, especially for Pennsylvania dealers.
New Jersey dealers had a stronger December, which may have pulled sales forward from January; this was in part due to financial-sector workers spending their year-end bonuses.

Industry contacts indicated that some larger dealers have begun hiring, mostly in sales.
More hiring is expected if robust sales continue into the spring season.

One Pennsylvania builder said it was the strongest January in several years.
A New Jersey builder closed deals that had been initiated in November and then dragged through December; the builder also reports a good backlog of sales.

Contacts cited a more active resale market as a positive trend but expressed concern over higher gas prices and increased compliance costs in the mortgage market.
A residential broker also reported a stronger January than last year.

The outlook among builders and brokers is modestly more positive.

Brokers and managers of nonresidential real estate have reported generally improving conditions for industrial, retail, and office space since the last Beige Book.

Office market contacts reported that signs of pent-up demand are emerging that will lead to positive net absorption by year's end.
The overall outlook for nonresidential real estate has improved since the last Beige Book, but growth will remain modest.
Services Third District service-sector firms generally have reported further growth since the last Beige Book.
A logistics firm reported very strong year-over-year results through the first six weeks of 2012.
Despite some expressed concerns, the contact is hopeful that this strong pace is maintained or improves when "freight season" begins in March.
Though somewhat skeptical of the sudden surge in confidence and market enthusiasm, one contact quipped, "I won't fight the tide!"
Advertising dollars are expected to build through the year with the Olympics and the presidential election.
One staffing firm reported a surprising dip in new orders compared with last year and a shift to short-term orders that are not indicative of growth.
The majority of service-sector firms anticipate growth will steadily improve in 2012.
