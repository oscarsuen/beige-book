Real Estate and Construction District residential brokers indicated that recent existing home sales were up slightly compared with year-earlier levels.
Buyer traffic also remained ahead of year-ago levels.

The short-term outlook for home sales remained positive overall, with the majority of contacts anticipating modest gains.
Reports from District homebuilders remained positive, as well.
Builders indicated that recent new home sales and construction activity were up slightly from year-earlier levels and new home inventories remained below year-earlier levels.

Nondurables output, with the exception of food and chemicals, remained soft.
A Southeast port contact reported record-setting cargo volumes in fiscal year 2012, with increases across all categories.
Despite the underlying increase in demand tied to replacement of aging truck fleets and the benefits of increased fuel-efficiency, new orders for heavy-duty trucks have stalled recently.
Rail contacts reported that lumber shipments have increased.
Air cargo companies saw an increase in cargo volume tied to the launch of various smartphones and computer tablets, which favor shipment by air over other modalities.

The improvement in demand for purchase loans was driven by activity in entry-level homes.
Demand for auto loans remained strong.
Business lending had increased slightly; however, contacts noted most of the increase was not organic loan growth but was primarily from customers switching from other lenders or credit cards.

The majority of businesses contacted reported relief for some input prices and little change in wage plans.
Firms responding to our Business Inflation Expectations survey reported that unit costs were up 1.3 percent in September over the past year, which is 0.3 percentage points lower than the August reading.
Looking forward, businesses' expectations for inflation also moderated somewhat.
On average, firms expected unit costs to rise 1.7 percent over the next 12 months.
Though that number was down from August, survey contacts noted that rising materials costs could be a source of moderate upward price pressure going forward.
Along those lines, several manufacturing contacts indicated that some input prices have increased recently, causing concern of additional margin pressure.
Surveyed firms reported that sales levels were 7.6 percent below "normal" times, though assessments varied widely by the size of the firm.
In particular, small and medium-sized businesses reported experiencing about twice as much slack as their larger counterparts, a finding that is consistent with anecdotal insights gathered from our business contacts.
Natural Resources and Agriculture After brief, precautionary shut downs related to Hurricane Isaac, regional refiners fully restored operations with very little damage from the storm.
Energy industry contacts continued to report that Gulf Coast refineries were undertaking investments to increase production capacity following refinery closures elsewhere in the country.
Natural gas prices continued to experience downward price pressures.
Contacts continued to note that inexpensive natural gas had prompted downstream manufacturers to relocate overseas operations to the U.S., prioritizing locations near refining operations.
Agriculture contacts said that the rise in some crop prices, resulting from the drought in the Midwest, had led to increased crop production in the Southeast where soil conditions were more favorable, but the overall rise in feed prices was putting pressure on livestock producers.
Compared with the same time last year, prices paid to farmers for corn, rice, soybeans, beef, and broilers were up while cotton prices were down.
