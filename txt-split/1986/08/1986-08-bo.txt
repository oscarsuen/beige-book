Overview Economic activity in the First District remains unbalanced.
The manufacturing sector is in the doldrums.
Retail sales were disappointing in May and June, but picked up in July.
Both manufacturers and retailers report vigorous price competition.
Reports from the real estate sector are mixed.
The Boston area is experiencing a seasonal slowdown in home sales, while other parts of the region continue to experience very strong sales activity.
Retail Department store sales in several New England chains were below plan in May and June and even lower than last year in some cases.
The first few weeks of July, however, look much better, lending support to retailers' optimism about the record half of the year.
Inventories are somewhat high but still not a source of concern, according to those contacted.
Prices are stable but margins appear to be shrinking.
After lackluster sales in May and June, department store representatives reported a noticeable pickup in early July, attributed at least in part to July's bad weekend weather.
Sales of TVs, VCRs, and microwaves are strong in stores aimed at moderate- income customers, while an upscale chain's strongest departments are men s and women's sportswear.
Sales of home repair and building supplies remain very strong.
There is considerable geographic variation in sales results within the region, but respondents attribute this more to the competitive conditions of specific stores than to differences in the strength of local economies.
Inventories are higher than expected in a number of stores, largely because of failure to attain sales plans.
Markdowns, especially for apparel, have been used to keep inventories in check, Aside from promotional reductions, prices are generally steady; several contacts reported, however, that intensified competitive pressures have increased promotional activity and eroded margins for the industry as a whole.
Disappointment with sales gains in recent months has not yet caused retailers' plans for the second half of the year to be revised downward.
Merchants remain confident that consumers will continue to be a buoyant force in the economy.

The electronics industry, which had seen signs of a pickup a few months ago, has experienced a leveling off.
Two major First District computer firms recently announced layoffs.
None of the manufacturers contacted has seen an increase in exports attributable to the decline in the value of the dollar, although one representative of the metalworking industry thinks import pressure may be starting to ease.

None of the firms contacted has seen any significant increases in prices from suppliers; several noted that they cannot raise their own prices.
Manufacturing respondents are very noncommittal about future prospects; if pressed, they expect a continuation of current conditions.
