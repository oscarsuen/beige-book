Federal disaster relief has been made available to most locales, some $600 million thus far in Mississippi alone.
The floods' agricultural impact included damage to farm structures, severe soil erosion in limited areas, some loss of cattle and vegetable crops, deterioration of pastures, and delays in planting.

The delay, however, mandates a shift from cotton to soybeans that may involve as much as 50,000 acres.
