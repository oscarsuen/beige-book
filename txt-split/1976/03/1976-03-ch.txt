The significantly improved tone in business and finance in the Seventh District noted a month ago has generally been confirmed by more recent developments.
Various forecasts of increases in activity have been raised, are presented more confidently, and are more frequently extended into 1977.

One large general merchandiser, who had been very skeptical of reports of improvements several months ago, now says that customers are buying more freely, especially the "middle and top" lines.
Inventories are moderate, and profits have improved significantly.
Perhaps the most dramatic improvement in this quarter has been in major household appliances.

Nevertheless, any improvement in new construction this year is likely to be concentrated in single-family homes.
A construction cost index for the Chicago area rose only 5 percent in the past year, half as much as in earlier years.
More important, bids on new construction projects are down significantly in many cases for the first time in many years, especially for structural steel work, as "hungry" contractors compete for business.
