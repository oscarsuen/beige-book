One special case of interest concerns a Kansas City International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local which filed suit in United States District Court asking that electrical contractors be ordered to comply with a collective bargaining agreement reached last year, under which the electricians were to have received on September 1 wage and fringe benefit increases totaling $1.00 per hour.
The union maintains that the contractors will be receiving windfall gains, due to their bidding of contracts at prices which included the expected wage increase, and that this is an inequity that will not be righted after the freeze ends.
The contract involved was settled by compulsory arbitration, without a strike and at wage increases described by the local's business manager as substantially below those received by other construction industry unions here.
There has been no court decision yet in this case.
