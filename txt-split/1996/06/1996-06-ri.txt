Port representatives continued to expect exports and imports to increase during the next six months, with exports expected to rise faster than imports.
Several port contacts said that an increasing number of ship lines were entering into vessel sharing agreements, an arrangement that the contacts believed would lead to more ships calling at their ports during the next six months.
Temporary Employment The demand for temporary workers increased in May.
Demand was especially strong for light-industrial laborers and customer-service representatives.

Contacts across the District reported that strong 1995 capital gains led to higher May estimated tax payments.
North Carolina and Virginia contacts said corporate tax collections were down significantly because of lower profits.
Retail sales collections were higher in the District of Columbia, Maryland and South Carolina and real estate recordation receipts rose in Maryland, North Carolina, and West Virginia.
Agriculture On balance, agricultural conditions improved in May and early June according to District analysts.
Spring planting was almost complete.
Recent rains brought relief to crops in dry areas of South Carolina, but led to flooding in some areas of West Virginia.

Despite these episodes, the weather was generally favorable for crops, and most were in good condition.
