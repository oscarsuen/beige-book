Eleventh District economic activity picked up in March and April.
More contacts reported price increases and lower inventories than in January and February, but there were fewer reports of wage pressures or labor shortages.
Manufacturing orders rebounded, although several producers said activity was below the level of a year ago, and demand for semiconductors and telecommunications equipment remained weak.

Apparel, paper, computer and livestock prices were lower.
Producers of cement, brick, crude oil and petrochemicals said that their inventories were below desired levels, while inventories were up for newsprint, lumber, and semiconductors, particularly memory chips.
Semiconductor inventories were much too large-roughly 50 percent higher than 6 months ago-but are "not even close to inventory levels of the big semiconductor cycles in the 1970s and 1980s."
Telecommunications and computer manufacturers said inventories were slightly larger than desired, and heavy competition was keeping downward pressure on personal computer prices.
Shortages of cement led producers to ration customers.
Brick plants in Texas are reported at near capacity, but strong demand had not yet led to higher prices.
Low inventories pushed up crude oil prices to between $23 to $25 per barrel for most of April, although oil futures suggest prices will decline.

Cold weather and snow in New England stimulated demand for heating oil at District refineries, causing a delay in the switch over to gasoline production.
Gasoline inventories were 5 percent under last year's levels, with the driving season starting at the end of May.
Electronics firms reported a slight increase in demand for computers, but demand for memory computer chips and microprocessors continued to be below expectations.
Overall, semiconductor demand in real terms was growing at about a 10 percent annual rate, compared to 30 percent five months ago.
Demand for telecommunications equipment also weakened, mainly due to softer sales in Europe.
Electronics contacts were very cautious about the outlook for sales, expecting only slight increases in the volume of sales into 1997. Business service firms reported a seasonal increase in demand.
Several firms were hiring and there were fewer reports of difficulty finding qualified workers.
Demand was up for passenger and cargo transportation, temporary, accounting and legal services.
Firms supplying temporary workers said that demand for workers to staff telephone call centers was particularly strong.

Retailers must use heavy promotion to attract the "price-driven consumer" because there are "too many stores in Texas."

Demand for oil services was boosted by increases in international and U.S. drilling activity.
Seasonally-adjusted, the U.S. rig count was up by over 50 rigs in April-to over 825 rigs-with two-thirds of the increase in Eleventh District states.
Natural gas drilling is pulling the rig count upward, and the Gulf of Mexico is well positioned to sell gas to the East Coast.
International drilling continues to increase, particularly in Latin America and Africa.
Drought, low cattle prices and high costs continued to stress the agricultural community.
Bankers reported an increase in the number of farmers and ranchers starting the year with large debt carryover, and expressed concern about the "serious problems" facing the agricultural community and the increased likelihood that some farmers and ranchers will quit or be forced out of business.
