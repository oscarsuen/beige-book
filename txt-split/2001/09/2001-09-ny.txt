With energy costs subsiding, overall input price pressures have eased, and increased competition has kept downward pressure on selling prices.

Both multi-family and single family housing permits rose in July, on a seasonally-adjusted basis, and were higher than a year earlier.
More recently, homebuilders in New Jersey reported that they are continuing to build wherever they can find available land, due to a persistent backlog of orders.

Manhattan residential rents, which had risen sharply in recent years, leveled off in the first half of 2001.
Rents in the outer boroughs also appear to have stabilized and vacancy rates have reportedly edged up.
Manhattan's co-op and condo market, which had remained fairly strong through mid-year, has taken on a softer tone in recent weeks, according to a leading real estate firm-unit sales in August were roughly on par with a year ago, but the average selling price was down moderately.
Despite continued weakness in commercial real estate markets, nonresidential construction activity has been brisk.
Manhattan's office market appears to have stabilized somewhat since midyear, as both rents and availability rates were little changed in July.

Office construction remains fairly brisk, particularly in northern New Jersey, where the volume of new construction is reported to be up 80 percent from a year ago.

Manhattan's hotel occupancy rate (seasonally-adjusted), held steady at 80 percent in July, but was down almost 10 points from a year earlier.

Reflecting the changing market conditions, the average room rate slipped to a three-year low and is down 7 percent over the past year.
