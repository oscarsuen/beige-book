Energy The Tenth District's energy industry has been more resilient than expected in the face of weaker nil prices due to surging production by most OPEC members.
Exploration and development activity in the district improved in July, despite domestic oil prices that averaged more than a dollar below June prices.
The average number of active drilling rigs in the district rose from 258 in June to 268 in July.
During the first three weeks of August the rig count increased to 274.

Consumer loan rates also increased by 50 basis points at most of the banks surveyed.
On average, deposits increased slightly at district banks, although a number of respondents report no change in deposits.
Agriculture Crop and range conditions vary widely across the Tenth District.
The effects of the drought on corn, soybeans, and other row crops remain of major concern.
Timely rains in many parts of the district have improved crop growing conditions and limited crop deterioration since the USDA's August 11 crop report.
Irrigated crops are generally in very good condition throughout the district, but the shortage of rainfall has boosted irrigation requirements and driven irrigation costs much higher.
Planting of the winter wheat crop begins during the next few weeks, and timely rainfall will be critical to the crop's early development.
The drought has also had a significant effect on district cattle feeders and ranchers, but drought-induced liquidation of district cattle herds has been limited.
Cattle feeding costs have risen, and scorched pastures and reduced forage production have forced the movement of cattle from drier areas to areas with better grazing conditions.
Development of winter wheat pastures this fall will depend on rainfall received during the next month.
If wheat pastures prove to be inadequate, further liquidation of district cattle herds may occur.
Despite the drought, most agricultural bankers in the district anticipate little change in the rate of loan repayments from last year Most borrowers were able to rebuild financial reserves in recent years, and this year highest crop prices will help offset smaller crop yields.
Most district farm lenders and borrowers will be able to withstand the effects of the drought.
