The Tenth District economy continued to grow in June and early July, but at a moderating pace.
Consumer spending was mixed, with reportedly level retail sales but robust activity in the travel and leisure industries.
Manufacturing activity slowed and residential real estate activity remained weak, but these trends were partially offset by strong commercial construction activity.
Energy activity continued to rise.
Recent precipitation improved growing conditions, although excess moisture in some areas limited wheat production.
Overall, District labor markets continued to expand, with announced hiring outpacing planned layoffs.
Reports of labor shortages and wage pressures remained unchanged from the last survey period.
Price pressures generally eased modestly despite high agricultural and energy prices.
Consumer Spending Consumer spending varied across sectors in June and early July, but sentiments about future activity were positive.
Most retailers reported no change in sales from May, which were below expectations reported in the last survey.
Sales of lumber, apparel and electronics were stronger, while home furnishings sales were weak.
Nonetheless, store inventories decreased and retailers anticipated faster sales growth in the months ahead.

Hotel occupancy rates and average room rental rates rose solidly.
Manufacturing Manufacturing activity slowed in June, although expectations about future activity improved.
The slowdown was concentrated in food processing, machinery manufacturing, and transportation equipment manufacturing.
The backlog of orders increased, as a reduction in both employment and work hours accompanied the drop in output.
Inventories of materials and finished goods increased again, after edging up in May.
Despite the immediate reduction in manufacturing activity, plant managers remained optimistic.
Production, shipments and new orders were expected to return to levels comparable to May.
Although District manufacturers trimmed their capital expenditures slightly, they expected capital spending to resume at prior levels in the coming months.
Real Estate and Construction The residential real estate sector remained weak in most areas, while commercial real estate activity continued to expand.
District residential sales slowed from May and were below year-ago levels.
Nevertheless, there were positive reports about residential real estate activity from markets in New Mexico and Wyoming.
Several sources from throughout the District reported that low to mid-priced homes sold better, while the market for condominiums and upper-end homes remained weak.

Commercial real estate activity expanded moderately in June and early July.
Office vacancy rates continued to trend down and were expected to decline in future months.
Absorption rates remained unchanged from the May survey but were expected to increase further in future months.
Growth in commercial rents moderated from the May survey, but expectations point to future increases in rents.

Energy activity was expected to increase further due to the recent jump in energy prices.
Labor constraints in the District energy industry eased slightly, with fewer contacts reporting difficulty finding qualified workers and more companies intending to add staff.
Agriculture Agricultural conditions were generally favorable, though wet weather raised concerns about the District's winter wheat crop in some areas.
Heavy rains in Kansas and Oklahoma, which caused some flooding, delayed the winter wheat harvest and led to deteriorating crop conditions.
Other parts of the District, however, reported above-average wheat yields.
Recent precipitation also further eased drought conditions and improved pasture conditions.
Despite some late planting due to wet fields, both corn and soybean crops were reported to be growing well.
The hog market remained solid, while a recent dip in cattle prices tightened margins for cattle producers.
High crop prices continued to bolster farm financial conditions, and loan repayment rates remained high and the number of requests for loan renewals and extensions eased further.

Hiring announcements continued to outpace planned layoffs, but net hirings were lower than in previous months.
