Preliminary March reports from Manhattan hotels show occupancy rates rising above already-strong February levels and room rates soaring roughly 15 percent above comparable 2006 levels.
Broadway theaters also report a brisk pickup in business starting in late February and continuing into early April: over this period, both attendance and total revenues are reported to be up roughly 12 percent from a year earlier, compared with increases of roughly 6 percent in January and early February.
Average theater ticket prices have leveled off, after sizable increases in 2006.

Construction and Real Estate The commercial real estate market in metropolitan New York City remained robust in the first quarter.
Manhattan office vacancy rates slipped to their lowest levels since 2001 and asking rents were up 20 to 30 percent from a year ago.
In addition, the sales market for Manhattan office properties is described as exceptionally strong.
Most suburban office markets tightened slightly in the first quarter: in Westchester and Fairfield Counties and on Long Island, vacancy rates edged down and rents rose roughly 5 percent from a year earlier; however, northern New Jersey's vacancy rate edged up above 17 percent, while rents rose 3 percent.
Housing markets continue to be mixed.
New York State Realtors report that statewide sales activity in early 2007 has been moderately lower than a year earlier, while the median sales price was virtually unchanged.
A northern New Jersey real estate contact notes that, while many high-end homes (over $1.5 million) have languished on the market, there are pockets of strength for more moderately priced homes.
A contact in New Jersey's homebuilding industry notes that, while homes priced at under $300,000 have been selling well, the overall market remains soft; new home prices are reported to be down from a year ago, and cancellation rates are said to be high, particularly in active-adult (retirement) communities.
Finally, Manhattan's co-op and condo market continued to show resilience in the first quarter: sales activity rose sharply, and the inventory of listings, though still fairly high, continued to decline.
However, selling prices for apartments, which had risen moderately throughout 2006 were reported to be virtually unchanged from a year earlier.
Other Business Activity A major NYC employment agency indicates that hiring activity picked up in March and early April, after a lull in the first two months of the year.
The main factor restraining hiring activity is reported to be a shortage of job candidates.
Salary offers are estimated to be up roughly 5 percent from a year earlier, on average, though candidates are often able to negotiate upwards.
More broadly, non-manufacturing firms in the District report continued moderate expansion in general business activity, increased hiring plans and continued widespread wage increases in early April.
In contrast, New York State manufacturers report little or no growth in business activity in March and early April, following a strong February, and indicate some slowing in hiring activity, though their expectations about the near term outlook remain generally positive.
Firms also note some acceleration in prices paid but report less widespread increases in prices received than in recent months, suggesting some downward pressure on profit margins.
