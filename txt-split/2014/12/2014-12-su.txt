Fabricated metal manufacturers in the Chicago and Dallas Districts noted widespread growth in orders.
Dallas reported that domestic sales for plastics were strong, while demand for plastics was steady in Richmond and declined in Kansas City.
Chemical manufacturers in the Boston District indicated that the falling price of oil relative to natural gas had made U.S. producers less competitive, because foreign chemical producers rely more heavily on oil for feedstock and production.
St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported that food production was little changed on balance, but production in Kansas City continued to decline.
Chicago and Dallas indicated that shipments of construction materials increased.
Manufacturers of heavy machinery in the Chicago District cited improvements in sales of construction machinery, but reported ongoing weak demand for agricultural and mining equipment.

Agriculture and Natural Resources Agricultural conditions were mixed across the Districts.
Livestock operations were more profitable than a year ago; but with crop yields generally at above-average to record-high levels, lower crop prices were depressing farm incomes.
Harvests were ahead of their normal pace in most Districts reporting on agriculture.
However, excess moisture delayed harvests in some Districts, affected the quality of cotton in the Dallas District, and damaged wheat and barley crops in the San Francisco District.
In contrast, drought conditions affected the Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco Districts, as well as parts of the Dallas District.
Dry weather delayed tree harvests in Richmond, even as Christmas orders picked up.
Compared with a year ago, prices were lower for corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay, but higher for milk, dairy, poultry, hogs, cattle, and tomatoes.
Livestock producers benefited from lower feed costs, and Chicago and Kansas City noted expansions in cattle herds.
Richmond and San Francisco reported increased exports of agricultural products, but Dallas reported lower dairy exports.
Natural resource activity was strong overall.
Oil and natural gas exploration, drilling, and extraction remained at high levels in the Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, with expansions in drilling activity in Kansas City and Dallas.
Atlanta reported that the recent drop in oil prices led firms to reevaluate their operations, though steady production is anticipated for both deepwater and onshore drilling; in the Dallas District, lower oil prices weighed on the outlook for drilling activity.
Natural gas prices decreased slightly as inventories grew.
Coal production in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts was up from a year ago.
Since the previous report, mining activity increased in the Minneapolis District.
Healthy demand for timber was noted by San Francisco, leading to increased shortages of equipment and skilled loggers.
Prices and Wages Overall price and wage inflation remained subdued in October and November.
Price increases for raw materials were generally muted, though there were some exceptions, such as prices for certain agricultural products and building materials.

However, transportation costs rose in some Districts where capacity constraints were an issue.
Chicago and San Francisco reported lower steel prices, but Dallas noted an increase in fabricated metals prices.
Pass-through of higher costs to downstream prices remained limited, although Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas reported an uptick in the number of firms raising or expecting to raise prices.

A number of Districts reported slight to moderate increases in labor costs during the reporting period.
Upward wage pressures continued to be evident for certain types of occupations and for skilled workers.
New York, Chicago, and San Francisco reported that employers were adjusting compensation to win well-qualified job candidates or to retain or give raises to high-value, long-term existing employees.
In addition, Atlanta noted nascent signs of wage pressures for lower-skilled jobs, whose wages have been flat for several years.
Minimum wage increases were said to be a source of higher labor costs in the Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts.
Boston, Chicago, and Dallas noted actual or prospective increases in health insurance costs; in contrast, San Francisco indicated that increases in health insurance premiums for the coming year were low by historical standards.
Some of the higher costs associated with health care were reportedly being passed on to employees.
