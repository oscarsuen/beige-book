Retail merchandise and tourism-related spending was described as being little-changed.
However, auto industry contacts cited a sharp increase in sales as a result of the cash-for-clunkers program.
Reports from real estate contacts indicated that the pace of decline in home sales continued to moderate in most areas compared with the same time a year earlier, while Florida Realtors noted continued sales gains from very low levels.
The inventory of unsold homes remains elevated, in part because of the continuing supply of foreclosed properties, and this is said to be keeping downward pressure on home prices.

Manufacturing activity continued to improve as reports of new orders and production levels increased.
Banking contacts reported that credit availability remained tight.

In Florida contacts actually experienced year-over-year gains in sales, particularly for existing homes.
However, downward pressure on home prices persisted.
Both Realtors and homebuilders noted that increases in supply because of foreclosures and short-sales were partially responsible for the price declines even as sales increased.

Most contacts characterized activity as weakening.

Most manufacturers indicated that their outlook for future production and sales improved.
However, most contacts also anticipated that employment would likely remain at low levels, with any extra demand absorbed using existing staff.

Banking and Finance Banking contacts continued to remark that credit availability remained tight.

But few contacts noted any plans to increase payrolls.
Some employment services contacts reported a modest increase in placements, however.

Natural Resources and Agriculture Drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico continued to decline in July and August, with the number of rigs in operation almost 50 percent lower than a year earlier.
Crude oil and gasoline inventories in the Sixth District remained well above their seasonal averages, with declines in drilling and refining only partially offsetting weakness in domestic energy consumption.

However, weak domestic and international demand continued to trouble the near-term outlook for the region's cotton and poultry industries.
