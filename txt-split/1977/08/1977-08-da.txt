A small number of sales in the Dallas-Fort Worth area are being financed with 60-month loans, but a survey of dealers and banks suggests that such loans account for well under 1 percent of all new cars sold.
Most new car sales in Texas are financed on terms of 36 to 42 months.
However, the proportion of new cars being financed for 48 months is increasing as these loans are more profitable than shorter-termed loans according to some respondents.

Placements of cattle on feed in West Texas have increased, reflecting declining costs per pound of weight gain from low feed grain prices.
In fact, placements have outpaced marketings since May, but feed lots are only at about 70 percent of capacity.
Because costs of gain have fallen to as low as 34 cents per pound and because feeder cattle prices and fat cattle prices are about $40 per hundredweight, a small profit per head can be made.
A further increase in placements is anticipated this fall because drought conditions have reduced forage conditions and hay supplies.
