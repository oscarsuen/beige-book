Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, and Samuelson were contacted this month.
Samuelson notes that a large majority of professional forecasters anticipate real growth of between 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 percent over the six-quarter period ending in 1978.
The exceptions, along with most nonprofessional estimates, are lower and are presumably based on the expectation that the lack of economic vigor will ignite inventory decumulation.
The anticipated economic climate is reminiscent of 1974, when several quarters of sluggish growth culminated in a collapse in demand.
All forecasts fall well below the 5 percent real growth target that Samuelson finds economically and politically desirable.
Samuelson and Eckstein both eschewed the Shadow FOMC's recommendation of a one-shot $4 billion drop in Ml to return to the target path.
Both are convinced this policy would result in a severe credit crunch and a recession.
"It's hard to envision a worse policy," according to Eckstein.
Each fears that a highly restrictive monetary policy will trigger massive tax reductions which, in combination, would be "disastrous" for capital expenditures.
Professor Houthakker finds no fault with the present long-run monetary growth targets.
He urges a stronger effort to achieve the present targets.
He notes that the outlook for the current account in 1978 is "not good" but believes it can be financed by the combination of higher interest rates here and lower rates abroad.
