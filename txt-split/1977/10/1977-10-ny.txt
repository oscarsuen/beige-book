Moreover, the leading bankers contacted did not expect any substantial pickup in the near term because of the strong liquidity position of potential borrowers.
Several financial analysts attributed at least some of the weakness in loan demand at commercial banks to increased competition of commercial finance companies in servicing the credit needs of small- and medium-sized businesses.
