Auto sales remain generally strong, but exceptions have grown more numerous.
Some areas report flatness, and some note actual slippage, except for imported models.

The same spottiness is found in department store and apparel sales.
Again, the greatest weakness occurs in hard-hit agricultural areas.
Elsewhere, yearly gains range from 6 to 12 percent.
Sales of retailers, particularly pleasure boat dealers, in parts of Florida have flattened; this trend may also reflect the late-starting tourist season.

Multifamily residential construction, the core of Florida's oversupply problem, is also reviving.
Apartment vacancies have fallen significantly and rents are rising.
Absorption of condominiums in South Florida has accelerated.
Construction of new condominium units is being started, and some apartment units are being converted successfully to condominiums.

Futures prices of citrus products have risen as buyers, fearing that last winter's freeze damage may reduce next season's crop, attempt to guarantee their supplies.
Growers caution that many buyers may hold contracts and take delivery; they feel that the number of contracts outstanding should be watched closely to preserve an orderly market.
Citrus juice price increases have not immunized Florida growers from financial losses.
Substantially lower juice yields, stemming from the effects of last winter's freeze, have resulted in higher unit costs of harvesting, processing, and transportation.
Elsewhere in Florida, reduced demand for ground coffee as a result of high prices has resulted in a layoff of one-quarter of the work force at the nation's second largest coffee plant.
