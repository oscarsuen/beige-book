As they have for some time, contacts indicated that the labor market was tight and that it was difficult to fill positions at all skill levels.

Producer prices were flat, with contacts reporting little change in input costs.
Consumer Spending Consumer spending increased slightly on balance over the reporting period.

Contacts remained optimistic that holiday spending would be higher than last year.
Light vehicle sales increased moderately over the reporting period.

Used light vehicle sales also moved up moderately.
Business Spending Business spending decreased slightly in October and early November.
Retail inventories were a little high overall.

Outlays were primarily for IT equipment and intellectual property.
A majority of contacts reported that their newly purchased capital had increased capacity.
Demand for transportation services declined modestly, most noticeably for long distance trucking.
Commercial and industrial energy usage declined modestly due to lower demand from the industrial sector.
Contacts attributed at least part of the decline to the GM strike.

Residential construction increased slightly.
There were reports that slower growth in demand had led some single-family homebuilders to slow the pace of new development projects.
One contact noted an increase in remodeling demand.
Home sales declined slightly overall, with larger decreases for homes at higher price points.
Overall, home prices were unchanged, while rents increased.
Nonresidential construction activity decreased marginally.
Commercial real estate activity was little changed at a strong level.
Contacts noted that demand for industrial space, particularly for warehousing and logistics, continued to be solid, and activity in the hospitality sector was also strong.
Contacts reported that demand for commercial real estate as an investment vehicle was robust because of relatively high capitalization rates in the District compared to other regions.
Vacancy rates edged lower and the availability of sublease space increased slightly.
Rents were unchanged.
Manufacturing Manufacturing production increased slightly overall in October and early November in spite of the strike at GM.
Steel demand increased slightly, with one contact reporting strong demand from energy transmission firms but slightly weaker demand from the auto sector.

Business loan demand increased slightly, with reports of strength in the commercial construction sector, but weakness in the agricultural sector.
Loan quality edged down and standards were little changed.
Consumer loan volumes increased modestly as lower rates continued to spur mortgage refinancing.
Quality and standards were little changed.
Agriculture Early frost and snow further delayed this year's harvest and diminished yields.
Overall, contacts expected the District's corn and soybean harvests would be much smaller than a year ago.
In addition, contacts expressed concern about crop quality, especially with short propane supplies in some places, which limited the amount of crop drying farmers could do.
Corn and soybean prices were down from the previous reporting period, but up from a year earlier.
Nevertheless, lower expected yields meant crop revenues would be down from a year ago.
Milk, egg, hog, and cattle prices moved up during the reporting period.
Contacts noted that demand for pork from China had grown despite U.S. tariffs because African swine fever had decimated China's hog herd.
More generally, contacts reported a pickup in overall agricultural exports, with some noting that news on trade negotiations sounded promising for future exports.
Farm incomes generally are expected to be down from last year, although government payments from the Market Facilitation Program will provide some support.
