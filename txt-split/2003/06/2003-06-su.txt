In some areas of the Richmond District, home sales in recent weeks displayed "unprecedented strength," including real estate agents reporting their best sales growth in more than twenty-five years.
However, inventories of unsold homes in late April and May were higher than a year ago in cities in the Kansas City District and were at record levels in Denver.
In the Dallas District, new home building continued to lose steam, and sales of existing homes were very weak, contacts there say that it will take new jobs and increased confidence to stimulate demand for new homes.

The Richmond District reports no signs of a pickup in commercial lending any time soon.

Conditions remain too dry in the Dallas District, where cotton planting was delayed because of insufficient moisture to germinate seed.
