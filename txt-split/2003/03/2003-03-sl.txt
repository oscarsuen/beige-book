A third of the dealers surveyed expect sales to be flat-to-slightly-down over last year in the next few months, the rest expect a moderate increase.

Real Estate and Construction Residential real estate sales are still up in most of the District.
Last year was a record year for home sales in Memphis, with an increase in total home sales of 20 percent in December 2002 compared with December 2001.
In Arkansas, home sales were very strong the last two to three months of 2002 but slowed as the weather turned colder.

In Memphis, contacts reported that there is virtually no building.
In central Kentucky, construction of hospitals, churches, and college facilities are under way or have just been completed, but several that have been announced are being delayed because of uncertainty about the economy.
Banking and Finance A recent survey of senior loan officers at a sample of District banks indicates little change in overall lending activity over the past three months.
Banks' credit standards for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans remained generally unchanged by large firms but were slightly tightened for small firms.
Most contacts reported a moderate decrease in the demand for C&I loans for large and small firms, citing a decrease in merger and acquisition financing needs and reduced plant investment as reasons.
The survey introduced questions about credit default swaps (CDS), but it appears that banks make very little use of them in either buying or selling credit risk, because, according to the respondents, CDS are more expensive, riskier, and more complicated instruments than loans.
Credit standards for commercial real estate loans were tightened somewhat even though demand remained about the same.
Both the credit standards and the demand for residential mortgage loans were reported to be generally unchanged.
Credit standards for credit card and consumer loans remained largely unchanged, but the demand for consumer loans decreased moderately.
Agriculture and Natural Resources Unusually cold weather in the Midwest stressed livestock and threatened winter crops.
Despite a good amount of snow covering the southern part of the state, Illinois winter wheat ratings have continued to decline.
Low levels of topsoil moisture add to concerns about the survival of the crop.
Rains will be particularly important in late February and March as the crop breaks dormancy.
