There were a few new reports of input cost increases, particularly for energy, but prices at the retail level remained largely in check.
District farmland values in 2002 posted the largest year-over-year gain since 1997, even as concerns increased about the impact of drought and continued low dairy prices.
Consumer Spending Overall consumer spending remained weak in January and February.
Most retail contacts indicated that sales results in January fell short of their conservative expectations, although one national chain noted some slight improvement in February.
Merchants said that sales of food and consumables were stronger than other items, particularly apparel.
Inventories generally remained lean as retailers sought to tightly control stocks, although one merchant reported that inventories were rising faster than sales.
A contact in casual dining noted that sales had been softening since mid-January, in part because of bad weather and increased fears of terrorism.
Auto dealers indicated that light-vehicle sales in the District had slowed from the torrid pace of year-end 2002, particularly in February.
Contacts said that light-vehicle inventories were higher than desired, with one noting that "some dealers are getting nervous," given the great deal of uncertainty about sales in coming months.
A manufacturer of recreational vehicles said that demand for lower priced units remained strong but that the high end was "suffering."
Tourism activities were reported to be flat to down in most areas, and one contact noted fewer attendees at boat and RV shows in the region.

Most contacts suggested that there had been little, if any, change in their actual capital spending or investment plans early in the year.
Many expressed uncertainty about the strength of the economy and continued to take a "wait and see" attitude.

Demand for lower priced homes was strongest in most markets, although there were a few reports of improving demand for higher priced new homes in some.

Apartment occupancy rates continued to trend down, despite little new development of multifamily rental units.
Nonresidential activity remained weak.
Office vacancy rates crept up in some markets, in part because of lease termination agreements.
While these deals increased official vacancy rates, they also reduced the amount of sublease and "shadow" space on the market.
One contact said of office leasing activity, "As for net new demand, we're just not seeing it."
Some reports suggested that vacancies rose in some older retail developments and that the number of new retail projects in the pipeline was slowing.
Manufacturing Overall, manufacturing activity remained generally soft but continued to show signs of improvement.
Nationwide, light-vehicle sales slowed in January and February but were still tracking at historically strong levels.

Applications for mortgage refinancing may have slowed somewhat, but remained much stronger than most bankers had anticipated.
Contacts noted some improvement in household loan quality, as delinquencies and charge-offs decreased modestly.
Business lending activity remained very weak.
A contact with one large bank said soft business demand was reflected in relatively flat loan volumes, a trend that has persisted over the past six months.
Banks that did experience volume increases suggested that the gains were due to market share shifts rather than a general increase in demand.
On balance, banks did not appear to be tightening standards on business loans, and there were a few reports that overall business loan quality had improved slightly.
Prices and Employment Costs There were a few new reports of increasing input costs, but retail price increases remained largely subdued.
Of particular concern to many contacts were rising prices of energy and inputs derived from petroleum.
One contact said that prices for diesel fuel had risen to "frighteningly high" levels, which could potentially send some small freight carriers into bankruptcy.
By contrast, steel prices were said to be stabilizing after some significant increases in 2002.

Nearly 40 percent of eligible farms in the District had signed up for aid under the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, with a crush of applications likely this spring.
With drought covering about half the District and another third of the region abnormally dry, there was increasing concern about the growing season.
Corn and soybean prices remained higher than a year ago, and contacts suggested prices could rise further, given low stocks and the potential for drought conditions to reduce yields.
Higher crop prices had already led food producers to raise some prices.
Very low dairy prices and low crop yields last year in parts of Illinois and Indiana contributed to increased financial stress in the District's farm sector.
