Almost all respondents reported that their loan rates had not changed during the preceding two months.
Delinquency rues for all types of loans were unchanged to slightly lower.
With regard to recent media reports and editorials urging an easing in the "regulatory burden" on banks in order to simulate lending, almost all loan officers indicated that capital requirements were not constraining their lending.
However, several lenders at small and midsized banks suggested that reductions in the number of regulations and in the amount of time spent complying with them would permit them to initiate more loans.
