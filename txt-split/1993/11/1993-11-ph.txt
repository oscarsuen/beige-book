Finance According to reports from bankers, loan vole outstanding in the Third District was moving up modestly in early October, due mainly to growth in consumer lending.
Bankers said most types of consumer credit were on the rise, with notable gains in auto loans.
Most of the bank lending officers contacted for this report said residential real estate financing continued to be healthy, with borrowers preferring fixed-rate loans for both purchase mortgages and refinancings.
Bankers also noted that consumers were opting for fixed-rate home equity loans as opposed to variable-rate home equity credit lines.
Based on comments from bankers, it appears that commercial and industrial lending ranged from flat to up very slightly.
Several noted that small business lending and lending to middle market companies were showing some signs of improvement.
Nevertheless, most said corporate borrowers were continuing to reduce debt and appeared to be planing further downsizing of their operations.
The balance of opinion among bankers contacted for this report is that total lending will continue to move up gradually in tandem with overall economic activity.
They expect business borrowing to grow slowly, at best, held back by continuing restructuring among larger firms.
They anticipate that the current upward trend in consumer lending will be maintained unless economic growth slips from its current pace.
