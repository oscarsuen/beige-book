Compared with November, fewer firms reported decreases in orders and shipments, although business was weak in nearly all the major manufacturing sectors in the region.

On balance, firms in the region have slightly increased their capital spending plans for the first two quarters of the year.
Retail On balance, Third District retailers reported slightly higher sales for the recent Christmas shopping period compared to a year ago.
Increases in sales in the last week of December and the first week of January provided many area retailers with the boost they needed to achieve year-over-year gains of around 2 percent, on average.
Price reductions to stimulate sales were described as very deep by store executives, who expect low profits for the season.

Sales of outerwear were also quite slow, hampered by unseasonably mild weather during most of December.
Sales of consumer electronics, jewelry, and home furnishings were better than most retailers had expected.

Finance Lending at major Third District banks increased moderately in December.
Outstanding loan volume has increased in all major credit categories, commercial, consumer, and real estate.
Much of the increase in consumer lending was said to be seasonal.
In contrast, the slight increase in business lending was seen as a potential trend by bank lending officers, who said low interest rates and anticipation of improving economic conditions have prompted some business borrowers to proceed with expansion plans.
Concern about business credit quality persists, however, and several of the bankers contacted for this report said they are more strictly enforcing credit policies than they had been.
Nevertheless, most banks in the region are still actively seeking to increase their commercial loans.
Bankers in the Third District expect business loan demand to move up, but not strongly.
Overall gains in commercial and industrial loans will be limited by bankers' concern about extending credit to industries currently or potentially experiencing relatively weak conditions, such as travel, food service, health care, and construction.
Bank lending officers are uncertain of the course of consumer and real estate lending, although many anticipate some easing in the growth of real estate loans after last year's large increase.
