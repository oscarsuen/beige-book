Shipments and new orders rose sharply at tobacco and paper manufacturing facilities.
A South Carolina paper producer said that because orders were stronger in June, his plant increased its payroll and was working employees overtime.
But contacts in the furniture and textiles industries reported that their demand softened, in part because of diminished consumer confidence.

A number of contacts reported that sales of higher-priced homes had slowed, a realtor in Columbia, S.C., characterized this segment of the market as "dead in the water" in that area.
While some realtors said that weakness in the higher-priced market segment stemmed in part from a loss of wealth in the stock market, others believed that stock market reversals had bolstered real estate sales.
A Fredericksburg, Va., realtor said that lousy returns on stock market investments had caused some people to "bail out" of stocks and into real estate.
A Richmond, Va., realtor added that people simply felt safer investing in real estate than in the stock market right now.
