Real Estate and Construction Third District commercial real estate markets have eased since last fall.
According to surveys by commercial real estate firms in the region, the office vacancy rate in the Philadelphia central business district has increased by about 2 percentage points, to around 12 percent.
Vacancy rates have increased more in suburban office markets, to an average of around 15 percent.
Vacancy rates are higher in the suburbs because more new space has become available in suburban areas and more space has been made available for sublease by firms that have scaled back operations or gone out of business.
Many of these firms were high-tech or e-commerce companies.
Rental rates have decreased, and in some markets, landlords have begun offering tenant improvement allowances.
There has been some renegotiation of soon-to-expire leases to extend them for longer terms at reduced rates.
Demand for industrial space has been fairly steady in most parts of the Third District, although vacancies have increased in a few areas where new buildings have become available.
