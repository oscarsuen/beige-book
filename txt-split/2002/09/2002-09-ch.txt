Existing home sales remained robust and even picked up in some markets in July and August.
Sales of new homes were again brisk, but growth appeared to be moderating.
Realtors and builders reported that the first-time-buyer segment continued to lead the market; both groups also noted a slight recovery at the relatively soft upper-end of the market.
Chicago's apartment rental market was reportedly soft, but one contact said that their occupancy rates were improving due in part to more generous concessions.
Nonresidential activity remained slow, but contacts suggested that the deterioration was leveling off.
Reports suggested that vacancy rates continued to be stable in most commercial segments, although there were reports from the Chicago area of an increase in vacant industrial space.

Conditions in heavy equipment markets remained very soft.
New orders for heavy trucks were at "deep recessionary" levels, according to one industry analyst, after customers had pulled orders ahead earlier this year due to changes in engine emission regulations.
This analyst also said that truck assemblies should drop-off after October once the current supply of old engines has been installed.

One contact from northern Illinois noted that manufacturing employment increased modestly between June and July, although average hours worked declined.
Demand for workers in the retail industry trended downward according to multiple sources.
Contacts reported no major layoffs in the District, which led a few to be optimistic for the end of the year.
One report, however, noted that most layoffs traditionally occur in the fourth quarter and speculated that tight profit margins could lead this year to be worse than last year.
There were no new reports of significant upward pressure in wages, though contacts continued to note that rising health insurance costs were affecting labor costs.
Agriculture Corn and soybean crop conditions continued to vary considerably across the District as of late August.
However, rainfall across much of the Corn Belt during the latter half of August prevented further deterioration in crop conditions.
Crops in Illinois and Indiana remained notably less favorable than elsewhere in the District, and contacts in central Illinois observed that corn yields might be down as much as one-third from a year ago.
In contrast, contacts in central Iowa expected near record corn and soybean yields.
Still, on balance, crops in the major corn and soybean producing states appear markedly less favorable at this stage of the season than was the case a year ago.
