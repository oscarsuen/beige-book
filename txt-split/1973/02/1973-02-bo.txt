All three of the outside correspondents contacted this month, Professors Eckstein, Samuelson, and Dr. Shapiro, favored a monetary growth target of 6 percent.
There was disagreement about the cause of the recent sharp increases in short-term money rates.
Eckstein and Shapiro argued that the rapid rise in short rates was not sustainable, not being justified on the basis of fundamentals.
They attributed the sharpness of the rise to concern about the course of inflation in general, and the willingness of the Federal Reserve to control monetary growth in particular.
Eckstein strongly criticized the high rates of growth of RPDs and the monetary aggregates over the last few months, and suggested that this "poor management" stemmed from placing too much attention on operational problems (the implementation of Regulation J) in relation to the more basic policy problems.
He felt that the emphasis on aggregates in recent years has been successful, and repetition of the attempt to manage interest rates would lead to an abrupt halt in monetary growth as in the 1966-69 era.
His policy prescription was for a smooth 7 to 8 percent growth in RPDs.
Shapiro advocated a 6 to 9 percent growth in RPDs on the grounds that this would stabilize inflationary expectations in a favorable way and produce stability in long rates.
Samuelson did not believe that uncertainty about monetary management has contributed to the increase in short rates.
He attributed the rise to exceptional strength in the economy which, in keeping with his philosophy of an "activist, swinging" monetary policy, led him to the recommendation that monetary policy needs to be tighter in the near term (4 percent money in February) than it needs be in the intermediate term (6 percent in most quarters).
He also stressed rate flexibility, suggesting that a run-up now could be followed by a leveling off or decline in the future.
Dr. Shapiro pointed to two factors relevant to the interpretation of inflationary pressures later this year.
First, several steps have been taken to increase the supply of food which will alleviate the upward price pressure 3 to 9 months from now.
Secondly, he cautioned not to generalize from the first few major settlements under Phase III.
This warning was based upon John Dunlop's espoused preference for a case by case approach.
The average collective bargaining settlement will be composed of wide extremes, rather than the blanket application of a fixed, permissible standard.
