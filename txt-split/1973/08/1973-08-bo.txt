A New Hampshire bank director says that he is only making new loans rarely and is making none for construction, new customers, expansion, or acquisitions.
This director attributes monetary tightness to a loss of demand deposits, in part due to firms cutting down demand deposits and in part due to competition from "NOW" accounts which are allowed in his state.
The new Fed ruling limiting four-year time deposits to 5 percent of time money prevents his bank from competing for funds.

Professors Eckstein and Samuelson had very different orientations in their policy remarks.
To Eckstein, the crucial issue for the monetary authorities is "whether or not to let disintermediation ruin housing".

California savings and loan associations face a situation like 1966.
He feels monetary policy is misguided by focusing on monetary aggregate figures which suffer from technical problems.
He cited various theories to explain the pattern of money growth in the first and second quarters, saying none had much to do with real economic growth.
Interest rates are the only indicator one can go by at the present time, he argued, since no one understands the recent behavior of the monetary aggregates.
Samuelson felt it is still unresolved whether the economy has entered a growth recession.
He suggested that the second-quarter real growth figures look too low and the third-quarter figures will look too high due to seasonal correction problems.
He agreed that we are in a partial credit crunch and that mortgage money cannot be obtained in many areas.
He feels, however, that a growth recession, even if it comes, would be "stagflation".
Monetary policy could not choke off the commodity price explosion without choking off a lot more.
Monetary tightness will not produce automatic, quick inflation abatement.
In order to reduce the growth in the aggregates, he would allow interest rates to continue to rise so that the move toward ease could come faster later if it became necessary to ease.
Citing the 1966 experience, he believes that policy can be successfully reversed.
Eckstein also felt policy could be reversed if it backed off soon.
