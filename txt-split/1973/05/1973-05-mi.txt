Our second-quarter Agricultural Credit Conditions Survey showed that the demand for farm loans increased substantially during the first quarter and is expected to remain strong in the second quarter.
Stronger first-quarter loan demand was due to greater spending by farmers and to difficulties in selling wheat in currently clogged marketing channels.
An inability to market wheat postponed income and forced farmers to borrow to meet current operating expenses.
Greater spending was primarily associated with this year's planned increased crop plantings and a general expansion in farm operations.
District farmers' outlays for machinery, land, and cattle were up noticeably.
Higher prices for cattle, fertilizer, seed, and equipment also raised agricultural borrowing this spring.
Survey respondents look for these same factors to result in strong second-quarter agricultural loan demand, especially as some items, such as fuel and fertilizer, become increasingly costly.
