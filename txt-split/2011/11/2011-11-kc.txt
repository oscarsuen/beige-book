However, contacts reported that shortages of equipment and labor continued to constrain the rate of increase in exploration to some degree, and one producer said the delay in the Keystone Pipeline project was hindering future growth.
Agriculture Agricultural activity varied across the District in October and early November.
Northern portions of the District, which received ample summer precipitation, reported above average corn and soybean yields at harvest and the majority of Nebraska's wheat crop emerged in good condition.
In contrast, drought conditions severely cut crop production in the District's southern regions, with Kansas and Oklahoma winter wheat crops in fair or poor condition.
Robust export demand continued to boost crop and livestock prices.
Farm income rose in areas with bumper harvests, while crop insurance was expected to mitigate losses in cases of poor yields or crop failure.
Strong farm income boosted farm loan repayment rates and trimmed demand for operating loans.
With rising farm income and strong demand from both farmers and non-farm investors, District farmland values posted another record high, with the strongest gains in the northern Plains.
Wages and Prices Price levels were generally stable, and wage pressures remained mostly contained, outside of a few skilled positions.
Manufacturing price pressures moderated somewhat, especially for raw materials, and fewer firms planned to raise selling prices.
Prices for construction materials stabilized, and retail prices were also flat as fewer firms expected increases.
However, transportation firms reported continued high input prices, and restaurants expected higher menu prices due to rising food costs.
Wage pressures were still contained in most industries.
However, some firms reported difficulties finding skilled workers and were forced to raise wages, particularly in energy and information technology fields.
Hiring plans were generally solid for most firms, particularly those in the energy, information technology, and manufacturing sectors.
