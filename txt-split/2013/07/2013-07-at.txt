With strong convention and group meeting activity planned for the remainder of 2013 and positive lead volume for 2014, District hospitality contacts anticipate the positive momentum of 2013 to continue in 2014.
Real Estate and Construction District brokers continued to report that existing home sales remained ahead of last year's level were mostly ahead of expectations.
However, brokers still report that inventories remain at low levels, and thereby restraining sales.
Shortages were also said to be putting upward pressure on home prices.

The outlook for construction and new home sales remained positive, but the outlook for growth moderated somewhat compared with our last report.
District commercial real estate contacts indicated that demand continued to improve from earlier in the year.
Construction activity was described as flat to slightly up from earlier this year and was dominated by build-to-suit projects and renovations of existing space.

Brokers reported that most markets still favored tenants; however, rate increases continued to be noted in select submarkets.

Trucking companies cited a rise in shipments of building construction materials, as well as chemicals; however, capacity remained constrained due to driver shortages.
Total year-to-date railroad volumes were reported to be flat through June, but significant activity was noted for petroleum-related products and other chemicals, forest, lumber and wood products, and metallurgical coal.
Banking and Finance Some institutions reported a pickup in mortgage loan demand attributed to improved housing markets and increasing interest rates.
They also indicated that while mortgage refinancing had slowed, new purchase loan demand had increased.
Demand for automobile loans declined as banks and credit unions noted they could not compete with zero percent deals from auto manufacturers.
Some bankers indicated vigorous competition for loans has led them to change loan features, such as relaxing guarantee requirements or covering a substantial chunk of closing costs.
Local community bank contacts had eased up on covenants and guarantees and were willing to take more risks, particularly when a loan fit a category in which they were interested.

Louisiana added jobs in construction, and education and healthcare.
All District states saw payroll contractions in their government sectors, with the exception of Mississippi, which showed a mild gain at the state government level.
In general, most input costs remained relatively stable, helping to support slightly stronger profit margins in the face of improving, but still below pre-recession sales levels.
Some notable exceptions were costs related to construction materials such as lumber, concrete, and drywall, which increased for a number of contacts.
The Atlanta Fed's Business Inflation Expectations survey showed year-ahead unit cost expectations ticking down from 2 to 1.8 percent in June, marking the lowest reading since January.
