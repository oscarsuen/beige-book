One contact attributed the sluggish sales to high energy prices severely affecting consumers' liquidity.

Selling prices for comparable merchandise are reported to be down slightly from a year ago, though changes in the mix, toward more upscale product lines, have boosted revenues.

New Jersey homebuilders report that, while prices still remain well ahead of a year ago, concessions are being offered for the first time in years.

On the supply side, builders indicate a shortage of drywall and gypsum products, and a considerable increase in lumber prices.
Manhattan's co-op and condo market generally remained strong in October and early November, though there were scattered signs of softening.
One major real estate firm notes that, while the inventory of unsold apartments has risen, October sales transactions were up 5 percent from a year earlier, and average selling prices were still up almost 15 percent.
Another contact indicates that the market for 2- and 3-bedroom apartments has slackened noticeably, whereas smaller, entry-level units have seen significant price appreciation and a shortage of inventory.
Commercial real estate markets across the New York City metropolitan area were mixed in October: Lower and Midtown Manhattan's office markets continued to strengthen, while most of the suburban markets slackened moderately.
Office vacancy rates climbed in Westchester and southwestern Connecticut, edged up in Long Island, and were little changed in northern New Jersey.
Asking rents were flat across most of the region, but were up 3 to 4 percent in Midtown Manhattan and Long Island.
Non-residential construction contracts in western New York State are reported to be running below comparable 2004 levels, but residential development has been brisk, construction has recently begun on a number of apartment projects in the Buffalo area, as well as a large hotel and casino 50 miles south of the city.

While the financial sector continues to account for a large share of their business, the strength in recent months has been broad-based.
Manufacturing contacts in the region also report some pickup in hiring activity in early November.
More broadly, manufacturing activity has shown signs of strengthening.

Manufacturers also note further increases in input price pressures and an increasing ability to hike selling prices.
