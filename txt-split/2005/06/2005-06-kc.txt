Manufacturing District manufacturing activity was largely stable in late April and May following two years of expansion.
Plant managers reported little growth in production and employment since the previous survey.
However, factory activity generally remained well above year-ago levels.
Several firms noted increased supplier delivery times, as truckers were avoiding less-than-truckload shipments in an effort to control costs.
Some factories were also delaying their own shipments to ensure full truckloads.
Most plant managers remained optimistic about the future, and a sizable share of factories plan to expand their workforces in the months ahead.
Many firms also plan to increase capital spending in the second half of the year, due to expectations of increased sales and the need to expand and replace plant and equipment.

Home prices were reported as increasing at moderate rates throughout the district.
Most agents expect slight increases in home sales and home prices in coming months.

Almost all respondents increased their prime lending rates since the last survey, and most respondents raised their consumer lending rates.

The count of active oil and gas drilling rigs in the region was basically unchanged from the previous survey but still much higher than in recent years.

In addition, several contacts noted improved conditions in the coal industry in Wyoming since the beginning of the year, as both spot and futures prices for coal have risen considerably.
Agriculture Agricultural conditions in the district weakened somewhat in late April and May.
A late freeze and heavy spring rains complicated spring planting in certain areas and forced some producers to replant crops.
In addition, producers reported that the condition of the winter wheat crop had deteriorated somewhat since the previous survey due to drought and freeze damage.
Pastures, on the other hand, were in good condition, providing adequate spring forage.
Farmers' capital spending for the rest of the year is expected to decline somewhat from a year ago due to the higher cost of fuel and fertilizer and lower farm incomes this year.
