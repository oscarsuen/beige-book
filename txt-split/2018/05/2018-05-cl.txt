Pricing power for banks fell sharply, which contacts attributed to heightened competition.

Retail sales activity in the District was reported to be in line with or weaker than activity seen throughout the United States.

Additionally, some auto dealers indicated that lenders are tightening credit and that loan and lease payments made by consumers are rising because of higher interest rates.

Many fabricated metals and durable goods producers noted increased demand for heavy machinery and other capital goods.
Some even moved up capital expenditures and plant expansions to keep up with increasing demand.
Extractive industries, transportation equipment, and agriculture were noted as strong end markets.
